   <td style="text-align:left;"> The au Jibun Bank Japan Composite PMI fell to 51.8 in December 2021 from a final of 52.5, which was the highest reading since October 2017, a flash figure showed. Still, the latest reading marked the third straight month of growth in private sector activity while rounding off the best quarterly performance since Q4 2018. Both manufacturers and services firms signaled softer rates of output, new orders, and new export orders. Also, overall employment grew at a softer rate amid a steeper rise in backlogs of work. On inflation, both input prices and selling charges rose at faster paces, amid higher material costs and supplier shortages. Finally, sentiment weakened to a four-month low, dragged down by concerns over supply chains, rising costs, and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including new strains. </td>

Qantas also declined 1% after flagging intense competition in the second half of the financial year and forecasting a A$1.1 billion first half loss due to months of lockdowns. Elsewhere, technology stocks tracked US peers higher, while the materials and financial sectors traded mixed. Meanwhile, Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe reiterated that the central bank would not increase the cash rate until actual inflation was sustainably in the 2-3% target range.

On the cost side, input prices increased for the fourth month running, with the rate of inflation accelerating to the highest since August 2008; while output price inflation rose at the fastest pace since October 2019. Looking ahead, business confidence weakened to the lowest since August, due to worries over new strains of coronavirus, prolonged supply chain issues, and persistent high cost. </td>

The giant of the skies will continue to fly, but its long-term future remains uncertain.                                                                                                                                                                               , Emirates, which owns roughly half of the A380 fleet, looks set to continue using it for many years to come.                                                                                                                                                                                     , But several other airlines stopped using their plane during the pandemic, and some have already been scrapped.                                                                                                                                                                                  , The A380 is the world's largest passenger jet. In standard configuration, it carries 545 passengers - although in theory it can carry a maximum of 853.                                                                                                                                         , The double-decker colossus has four engines, an 80-metre wingspan and a maximum take-off weight of 560 tonnes. It is also very complex - containing around 530km (330 miles) of wiring.                                                                                                         , Yet according to Alex Scerri, a former A380 Captain, it is remarkably easy to fly.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "Airbus have managed to engineer the A380 so that it feels just like a much smaller plane like the A320," he says. "It's remarkably nimble, and it really doesn't feel like a 600-tonne aircraft."                                                                                              , The project was conceived in the early 1990s. The A380 was meant to be a symbol of European industrial prowess, a flagship for the Airbus fleet to surpass Boeing's 747 jumbo.                                                                                                                  , At the time, it was widely assumed that major airport hubs around the world would become more and more congested as cities grew and air traffic multiplied. This would create a market for very large planes which could carry more passengers without increasing the number of flights.        , By the time the A380 made its first commercial flight in 2007, however, the seeds of its demise had already been sown.                                                                                                                                                                          , While Airbus engineers struggled to get the superjumbo onto the market, Boeing was quietly marketing long range versions of its economical twin-engine 777 - and developing the 787 Dreamliner.                                                                                                 , The 787 was a design which made the most of advances in engine technology, as well as in composite materials and aerodynamics. The result was an aircraft that was much more efficient than previous models, used less fuel and was therefore cheaper to run.                                   , Together with Airbus' own A350, launched a few years later, it changed the shape of the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Instead of using giant planes to transport huge numbers of people between 'hub' airports, before placing them on connecting flights to other destinations, airlines could now fly smaller planes on less crowded direct routes between smaller cities which would previously have been unviable., Compared with these new designs, the four-engine A380 was expensive to buy and costly to run.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "The technology on the A380 was basically from the 1980s," says Peter Morris, chief economist at the aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium. "It was frozen into the design before the step-change in aircraft technology - before carbon composites and highly efficient engines".              , As a result, Airbus struggled to sell it. Only 251 planes were ever built, and the programme struggled to break even - let alone recoup the more than $25bn invested in it.                                                                                                                     , Yet according to Airbus executive Philippe Muhn, the project still brought significant benefits to the organisation, which had developed from a grouping of manufacturers from different countries.                                                                                             , "This was an aircraft that allowed the company to integrate, from a technical standpoint, industrial standpoint, and culturally as well", he explains.                                                                                                                                          , "And then of course all the investment in the A380 technology was the foundation of what the A350 is today."                                                                                                                                                                                    , But, while it may have been a commercial failure for Airbus, the superjumbo has clearly been a success for its primary customer.                                                                                                                                                                , Emirates used it to create a global network of high-density, long-haul routes centred on its base in Dubai. That helped it to become one of the world's largest airlines.                                                                                                                       , "For Emirates it created a niche in the market", explains Peter Morris.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "Without the A380, I contend that Emirates would never have reached the level that it did. They managed to make something which helped build the prestige of Dubai, and created a market for the plane as well. It did work."                                                                   , But for other airlines, the superjumbo was less of a success. Filling all of those seats could be a challenge - and when the Covid pandemic hit, virtually the entire fleet was grounded.                                                                                                       , While some carriers are now bringing them back, others, such as Lufthansa and Air France have decided to retire their fleets for good.                                                                                                                                                          , That raises the question of what will happen to the unused planes. In theory, they could fly for decades. But according to Ascend by Cirium, the second-hand market for such large aircraft is "small to non-existent".                                                                         , It is likely, then, that more A380s will simply go to the scrapyard, following the seven that have already reportedly been sent.                                                                                                                                                                , But others will remain in service. Emirates, which has 118 A380s, says it will continue to fly them for the next two decades - though over time their number is likely to shrink as newer planes are brought in.                                                                                , However long it continues to fly, aviation historian Shea Oakley thinks the superjumbo has already sealed its place in history.                                                                                                                                                                 , "Tragically for Airbus, they built a technological masterpiece, but they chose the wrong vision. It was a fine aircraft, but the wrong choice for the times", he says.                                                                                                                          , "I'm not sure there will ever be a larger aircraft than the A380."                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , A trip full of surprises as Romesh tries an adventure closer to home                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Killing Escobar: An incredible true story of one man's mission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , © 2021 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stock futures inch higher following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , U.S. stock futures were slightly higher Wednesday evening after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed chair Jerome Powell's press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.                                                       , "It appears that the Fed had successfully communicated this news ahead of time and although the stock market moved higher during the press-conference, the sectors leading the market higher (like utilities and healthcare) are both very defensive sectors and indicate some concern about the future path of the economy," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance., Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Typhoon Rai rapidly strengthens as it nears the Philippines - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Typhoon Rai is rapidly strengthening east of the southern Philippines and may be on the verge of becoming a super typhoon. The storm is on track to slam the southern and central portions of the country Thursday.                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Rai currently has sustained winds of 215 kph (130 mph), making it the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.                                                                                                                                                            , Favorable conditions across the region, including very warm ocean waters and low wind shear, led to the storm strengthening from a tropical storm to a potentially catastrophic, high-end typhoon in the past 24 hours.                                                                                           , Additional strengthening is expected, and the current forecast from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center is for Rai to reach 260 kph (160 mph) at landfall.  This would make Rai equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane or a super typhoon.                                                                             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In the Philippines, the storm is known as Odette and is being monitored locally by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).                                                                                                                                     , The outer bands of the storm are already spreading rain into the southern and central regions of the country and conditions will deteriorate quickly in the coming hours.                                                                                                                                         , It is already Thursday in the Phillippines, and from Thursday morning through Friday morning, the rains are expected to be "heavy to intense and at times torrential," PAGASA said in its forecast bulletin early Thursday morning.                                                                               , More than 250 mm (10 inches) of rain will fall across portions of Mindanao and the Visayas. The intense rain is expected to cause widespread flooding, flash flooding, and landslides in higher terrain.                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , PAGASA has already issued Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal 3 for high winds in southern portions of the Visayas and northern Mindanao. As the storm nears landfall, Thursday afternoon locally, PAGASA may increase the warning signal to 4 or even 5 -- the top of their chart.                                   , In addition to the strong winds, flooding and landslides, coastal regions will be on alert for three to four meters of storms surge and shipping vessels will face extremely rough seas over the next several days.                                                                                               , December storms are not uncommon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , In the West Pacific, there is no defined "season" for tropical systems as there are in other basins like the North Atlantic (June 1 to November 30). While activity peaks in the late summer to early autumn, storms can occur in any month of the year.                                                          , The Philippines is no stranger to catastrophic storms in December. In the last decade, numerous intense and deadly storms have impacted the region.                                                                                                                                                               , In 2011, Tropical Storm Washi killed well over 1,000 people in the southern Philippines and never made it to typhoon status. The storm was comparatively weak, but dumped massive amounts of rainfall, leading to devastating flash flooding and landslides during the overnight hours while people were sleeping., Just a year later, in December 2012, Bopha also hit the southern Philippines region of Mindanao. Bopha was much stronger than Washi, hitting the region as a super typhoon, and killing more than 1,000 people.                                                                                                   , The Philippines was also struck by strong and deadly typhoons in December 2014 (Hagupit) and 2016, when Typhoon Nockten struck on Christmas Day.                                                                                                                                                                  , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Kudlow: Why Elon Musk should be Fed chairman </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> ‘Kudlow’ host discusses the Democrat Party's economic policies and why Elon Musk deserves to be Times ‘Person of the Year’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Save America. Kill the bill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , And can we please get a Federal Reserve with a backbone? Here's a couple thoughts on today's wussy Fed announcement that they're going to move faster on tapering bond purchases and there might be three little bitty rate hikes next year.                                                                                                                        , And oh yeah, Jay Powell told the press conference he was confident inflation would drop to 2% by the end of next year. Wanna bet? On that bet, I'm taking the under.                                                                                                                                                                                                , Know who the best inflation forecaster in the country is? Senator Joe Manchin. Numero uno. I don't even know if he talks to economists, but since last winter when the $2 trillion Democrat so-called relief package was implemented, Joe Manchin has been warning about inflation.                                                                                 , And that's why he has argued consistently all year that Biden's big government socialist bill should be paused until inflation is clearly falling, which it is not. CPI up 7%, PPI up 10%. And today we got another whopper, with an 11.7% rise in import prices. How about that?                                                                                   , Manchin by the way, in his original memo to Chuck Schumer last summer, called for the end of QE – quantitative easing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , BIDEN’S BUILD BACK BETTTTER ‘ONE OF WORST BILLS IN AMERICAN HISTORY’: GOP REP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , FOX Business' Charlie Gasparino discusses the highly-anticipated Fed response to rising inflation and its impact on the cryptocurrency market                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Joe Manchin makes me feel proud to be a former Democrat, as were both of my presidential bosses, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , If today's Democratic Party were full of Joe Manchins we'd probably all still be Democrats. The guy's a superstar. He's also a better forecaster than several million economists, not to speak of the White House and the Fed, who bungled the inflation story.                                                                                                     , Manchin's also right in his policy ideas: Pause the bill and stop QE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But the Jay Powell Fed has been nosing in favor of more spending. And today he had a chance to end QE flat in its tracks. But he didn't do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , FED DOUBLES TAPER RATE TO $30B A MONTH, SIGNALS INTEREST RATE LIFTOFF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , So to quote our friend Kevin Warsh, former Federal Reserve governor: "The Fed is still enabling massive government spending by buying up the debt and pumping up the money supply."                                                                                                                                                                                 , The Fed today should not only have ended QE, but they should have announced their intention to start raising their target rate next month – January. They missed a big opportunity to show strength and determination.                                                                                                                                              , Democrat Larry Summers is right. Today's central bankers are more interested in climate change and woke social policies than fighting inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Washington Examiner Editor-in-chief Hugo Gurdon weighs in on current labor participation and whether Biden’s Build Back Better agenda will get pushed through before year end.                                                                                                                                                                                      , And as John Maynard Keynes said decades ago, "inflation is the cruelest tax of all." It is middle-income and lower-income folks who get hurt the most with skyrocketing prices for food, energy, homes, construction, gasoline, meat, turkeys, you name it.                                                                                                         , The Fed is so far behind the 8-ball now that, as former CEA chair Kevin Hassett told us yesterday, not only should they be raising rates immediately with a 50 basis point hike, they should take actions in between meetings to keep raising rates. And then, in a year or 18 months, inflation may start coming down.                                             , Finally, I have another idea for a new Fed chairman if Joe Manchin won't take the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , ELON MUSK NAMED TIME’S ‘PERSON OF THE YEAR’ FOR 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , How about Elon Musk, Time Magazine's Man of the Year?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , How can I say such an outrageous thing?

I worked with him several times in the White House, and he's very smart and savvy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Second, the mere fact that socialist Elizabeth Warren is attacking him for not paying his "fair share" of taxes is by itself a fabulous endorsement of Musk's philosophy, business prowess.                                                                                                                                                                         , Am I saying anybody Warren opposes gets my stamp of approval? Yes.

Indeed, he has come out against the entire reckless tax, spend, and regulate Biden policies.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Australia Services PMI decreased to a two-month low of 55.1 in December 2021, from 55.7 in the previous month, a preliminary estimate showed. Still, this marks the third consecutive month of expansion in the sector amid a further easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Solid demand and business activity growth were seen even though the rates of growth softened from November. Service providers also expanded their workforce capacity at a faster rate to meet the rise in demand. As a result, backlogged work built at a slower rate. That said, anecdotal evidence suggested that issues of supply shortages persisted. Cost pressures meanwhile remained elevated with input price inflation climbing to a fresh record on the back of higher costs such as wages and fuel prices. Output prices likewise rose as firms passed on their costs to clients. </td>

Still, despite the decline, it was comparable with the average of 2021 as a whole. Growth of manufacturing output and new orders both decelerated in December but remained at marked levels amid the further easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Australia. In turn, both employment levels and buying activity continued to expand with the former rising at a faster pace. Supply constraints persisted in the manufacturing sector with suppliers' delivery times continuing to lengthen amid shortages and shipping delays, according to panelists. </td>

They moved out of a small Manhattan apartment in 2018 to stay in short-term rentals around the U.S. before embarking on a yearlong honeymoon to travel the world, starting in the Philippines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , When the pandemic cut their travels short last year, Mr. Angert, 31, decided to take a job in public relations in Richmond, Va. He and Mrs. Angert, who is also 31 and works at a healthcare tech company, started house hunting this spring. After losing out on multiple offers, they raised their $400,000 budget. In July, they plunked down $635,000 on a three-bedroom ranch in a tree-filled lot near a Richmond country club.                                                                                                             , "I would have had all of these regrets in life if I didn’t travel," Mr. Angert said. "But it feels like the right time to settle down and put down some roots."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A sale pending sign is displayed outside a residential home for sale in East Derry, N.H.

Instead, since 2019, when they surpassed the baby boomers to become the largest living adult generation in the U.S., they have reached a housing milestone, accounting for more than half of all home-purchase loan applications last year.                                                                                                                                                         , The generation’s growing appetite for homeownership is a major reason why many economists forecast home-buying demand is likely to remain strong for years to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Rarely has the for-sale home market been more heated than in the past year. The median price of an existing home sold in October was nearly $354,000, close to a record and up about 13% from a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices have climbed from a year earlier for a record 116 straight months, with double-digit percentage gains touching every corner of the U.S. this year.                                                                                                                            , The frenzy has eased a bit in recent months. More buyers are pausing their searches or walking away, discouraged by the prices and a shortage of homes for sale, real-estate agents say. Some market watchers expect home sales to flatten or decline from current levels. They say the Covid-19 pandemic produced a sudden, unforeseen spike in home buying that won’t be repeated, pulling forward sales that would have been spread out over a number of years.                                                                                , A realty company's signs rest on several lawns in front of newly constructed houses in Brandon, Miss.

They say the pandemic and the emergence of remote work accelerated millennial home-buying trends already underway. Young families living in apartments decided to buy houses in the suburbs or leave expensive cities for cheaper ones. Millennials who already owned homes traded up for more space. Forbearance on student-loan payments, federal stimulus checks, and a booming stock market helped some first-time buyers afford a down payment., The generation accounted for 67% of first-time home purchase mortgage applications and 37% of repeat-purchase applications in the first eight months of 2021, according to CoreLogic. And as the largest cohort of millennials turned 30 this year—below the median first-time buyer age of 33—those percentages could rise higher still. That’s especially true because millennials are getting married and having children later in life than recent prior generations, events that can often prompt a home purchase.                           , The financial stakes could scarcely be higher for millennials, who have faced a wide wealth gap with previous generations. Burdened by student debt and with career paths sidelined by the 2008 financial crisis and housing-market collapse, many millennials lacked the savings for a down payment in their 20s. Some distrusted homeownership as an investment. Credit standards tightened after the housing crash, making it more difficult for many young borrowers to qualify for loans.                                                    , INFLATION NOT HURTING HOMEBUILDER SENTIMENT: NAHB CEO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Some real estate brokers also theorized that millennials preferred to rent and spend money on travel and experiences rather than buy houses. "We talked for years about how millennials preferred to ‘do’ rather than to ‘have,’ "said Richard Ruvin, a Realtor at Keller Williams Milwaukee North Shore in Wisconsin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But sitting on the sidelines meant missing out on one of the biggest sources of wealth creation for past generations: equity in a home. In 2019, households of older millennials had a net worth about 11% below expectations based on what older Americans had at the same age, while younger millennials’ net worth was 50% below, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.                                                                                                                                                          , Home prices have soared in the past year, raising questions about whether now is the best time to jump into the market. But purchasing a home is still more affordable for many first-time buyers today than it was for older generations, said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corp. That’s because incomes are higher and mortgage-interest rates have declined from above 10% in the 1980s to around 3% today.                                                                                                       , A typical mortgage payment for a median-priced U.S. single-family existing home made up 17% of the median family income in the third quarter of 2021, according to NAR. That’s down from about 23% in 1990, when many baby boomers were in their late 20s and 30s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The main challenge for millennial homebuyers, Mr. Fleming said, isn’t whether they can afford to buy a house but whether they can win a bidding war. The frenzied market this year has made it especially difficult for buyers with small down payments to compete. First-time buyers often lose out to all-cash buyers or investors buying to flip or rent out the homes.                                                                                                                                                                        , West Hempstead, N.Y.: Real estate agents Rosa Arrigo, center, and Elisa Rosen, right, work an open house in West Hempstead, New York on April 18, 2021.

There were 1.25 million homes for sale at the end of October, down 12% from a year earlier. Mortgage finance company Freddie Mac calculated at the end of 2020 that the U.S. housing market was 3.8 million single-family homes short of what is needed to meet the country’s demand.                                                                                                                                                                    , That mismatch is providing a sort of floor for the market, an army of buyers ready to swoop in and act if prices begin to sag, brokers and real-estate executives say. About 32% of millennials surveyed by housing-research firm Zonda in late 2020 and early 2021 said they planned to buy a home in the next one to three years or as soon as they could save for a down payment. Only 7% said they never plan to own a home.                                                                                                                  , "You very much could have record-high levels of demand" in the coming years, said Ryan Dobratz, co-lead portfolio manager of the Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund, which invests in real-estate companies including home builders and land developers. "That’s just because of the millennial cohort finally moving to single-family housing in a big way."                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mariel and Matt Balaban, who are 35 and 36, respectively, were happy living in rental apartments for years, but having children changed their perspective. When the pandemic struck, Mrs. Balaban was pregnant with their second child, and they decided to move from California to Pennsylvania to be closer to their families. After touring more than 30 homes, the couple had their fifth offer accepted this spring on a four-bedroom house in Wayne, Pa.                                                                                    , READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "My husband and I both grew up in houses with yards and neighborhoods, and I think we both wanted that for our daughters," Mrs. Balaban said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , About 31% of older millennials and 43% of younger millennials don’t currently have a mortgage but could qualify for one, according to a Freddie Mac analysis of credit-bureau data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , In the first eight months of the year, millennials comprised the highest share of purchase mortgage applicants in San Jose, Calif.; Austin, Texas; and Seattle, all metro areas with a high number of tech jobs, according to CoreLogic. Millennials also accounted for more than half of applicants in more affordable markets such as Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, and Buffalo, N.Y., CoreLogic said.                                                                                                                                                 , "We have a lot of people that have chosen to rent for a lot longer than maybe they did 10 or five years ago," said Dana David, a real estate agent in the Buffalo area. "Instead of buying your first house and having it be a $150,000 house, now we’re seeing a lot of first-time homebuyers be in the $250,000 to $350,000 range."                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Increased millennial buying clout is starting to change the face of U.S. homeownership.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock indexes reversed earlier losses to trade sharply higher after the Federal Reserve avoided any drastic changes to its monetary policy. As expected, the policymakers announced it will speed up the end of its pandemic-era bond purchases and paved the way for three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022, voicing concerns over persistently high inflation against a backdrop of a steady recovery in the labor market. The Dow Jones gained more than 350 points, after shedding around 100 points earlier, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2%, after losing as much as 1.2%. Earlier, data showed US retail sales rose modestly in November as consumer spending slowed on the back of rising prices, import and export prices continued to increase at solid rates and the producer prices grew the most in over 13 years. </td>

The firm has been plowing money into start-ups and projects this year, and already fully deployed its latest $2.2 billion fund raised in June, according to Axios.                                                                                       , Haun co-launched Andreessen's crypto funds with Chris Dixon, who will stay on and lead the firm's blockchain investments, alongside three other partners.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "When Chris and I started our first crypto fund in 2018, it was a moonshot experiment," Haun wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. "Thanks to the hard work of many, it has exceeded both of our wildest expectations. Today, it's more apparent than ever that web3 will transform the internet."                                                                   , Haun is heading out on her own as crypto investing moves beyond bitcoin and digital currencies and takes on broader significance in what techies are describing as the next wave of the internet, called Web3 or Web 3.0. She said she will keep her board seats at Andreessen's portfolio companies, including OpenSea and Coinbase.                         , Andreessen Horowitz will be a limited partner in Haun's new fund. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the firm's founders, and Dixon will all personally contribute to Haun's new endeavor.                                                                                                                                                                     , Known for early bets on companies like Instagram, Lyft, Pinterest and Slack, Andreessen Horowitz made its first foray into digital assets through Coinbase in 2013. Its first official crypto-focused fund launched three years ago, during what's now known as "crypto winter." That year, the value of bitcoin cratered roughly 80% from the highs in 2017. , Bitcoin is up about 700% since Andreessen announced its first crypto fund, and was trading above $49,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , WATCH: Katie Haun on Andreessen's newest crypto fund                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Federal Reserve will cut back its stimulus programme more quickly than planned, as it ratchets up its response to rising inflation.                                                                                                                                                 , The US central bank had already announced it was tapering off the monthly support, introduced to bolster the economy during the pandemic.                                                                                                                                               , But on Wednesday officials said the process would be speeded up, suggesting the stimulus will end by March.                                                                                                                                                                             , The move opens the door to an interest rate rise in the first half of 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Economic activity is on track to expand at a robust pace this year, reflecting progress on vaccinations and the reopening of the economy," said Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.                                                                                                   , "In my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Demand remained "very strong", although the arrival of the Omicron variant posed a risk to the recovery, he added.                                                                                                                                                                      , Officials forecast that inflation will run higher next year than they had previously projected and that unemployment, the other measure targeted by the Federal Reserve, would fall to 3.5%.                                                                                            , As a result they forecast that benchmark interest rates would need to rise from current near-zero levels to 0.9% by the end of 2022.                                                                                                                                                    , Analysis: North America Business Correspondent, Samira Hussain                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , All year long, the Federal Reserve has been advocating a "patient" approach to winding down its support of the economy.                                                                                                                                                                 , But faced with inflation at an almost 40-year high, the committee basically said, right we need to get on with it FAST. It's a particularly hawkish tone by the normally "wait and see" Fed.                                                                                            , For several months, the Central Bank had been calling inflation "transitory." That word has been put to pasture.                                                                                                                                                                        , Americans are struggling to meet the cost of basics like food and housing because of skyrocketing prices. But this is an indication that the Fed is also spooked by the dramatic rise in inflation and concerned about just how long it will stick around.                              , The Federal Reserve began winding down its $120bn-a-month bond-buying programme in November, saying it would reduce the stimulus by $15bn a month.                                                                                                                                      , But November's inflation data, showing prices rising at a pace not seen since 1982, increased pressure on the central bank policy-makers to take further action.                                                                                                                        , The stimulus will now be reduced by $30bn a month starting in January.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "The Fed apparently just woke up to the inflationary pressures consuming the US economy. With [Consumer Price Inflation] in touching distance of 7%, it should be of no surprise to see the Fed accelerating tapering," said Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors., "Price pressures may well ease next year, but inflation will settle at a level uncomfortably high for the Fed," she added.                                                                                                                                                              , "The big question for markets now is: can the US economy digest this pace of [interest rate] hikes without ending up with a stomach ache?"                                                                                                                                              , The new Omicron coronavirus variant has added uncertainty over the future path of the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                          , However the Federal Reserve said it expected economic growth to be 4% next year, higher than the 3.8% projected in September.                                                                                                                                                           , Diane Swonk, economist at Grant Thornton, said Mr Powell had chosen his words carefully reflecting that "this is a booming economy in which inflation has been more persistent" but that there had also been "extraordinary progress towards full employment".                          , His language around employment had been "very bullish" she said, "justifying rate hikes sooner rather than later".                                                                                                                                                                      , A trip full of surprises as Romesh tries an adventure closer to home                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Killing Escobar: An incredible true story of one man's mission                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , © 2021 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI Crude Reverses Losses After Fed Decision </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures erased earlier losses to trade around $71 a barrel on Wednesday after the Fed avoided any drastic changes to its monetary policy and in spite of fears that supply will outstrip demand. The US monetary authority, as expected, announced it will speed up the end of its pandemic-era bond purchases and paved the way for three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022, voicing concerns over persistently high inflation against a backdrop of a steady recovery in the labor market. Earlier, data from the EIA showed crude oil stockpiles in the US dropped by 4.584 million barrels last week, the third consecutive period of declines and compared with market forecasts of a 2.082 million fall. Also, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday that a surge in Covid-19 cases with the emergence of the omicron variant will dent global demand at a time when crude output is expected to increase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Talks between Manchin and Biden at standstill as Build Back Better likely stalled until next year - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Senate Democrats are expected to punt consideration of the cornerstone element of President Joe Biden's agenda into next year after private conversations between Biden and the key Democratic holdout made clear the bill would not have the votes to pass this month.                                                                                                                                                      , Critical talks between Biden and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, the Senate's most important swing vote, over how to pass a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package remain far from any resolution on a series of issues, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the discussions.                                                                                                                                 , The impasse, even as talks are expected to continue, marks the clearest sign yet that Democrats will be forced to delay a Senate vote until at least 2022 despite an effort by leadership to approve the bill before Christmas.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , A source briefed on the conversations tells CNN that talks between Manchin and Biden over the bill, known as Build Back Better, are "very far apart." Given the state of the talks between the influential moderate senator and the President, sources familiar with the matter say Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is very likely to punt the bill into 2022.                                                                , One of the most pivotal issues holding up progress is the child tax credit, a major Democratic Party priority that delivers aid to families and is key to the Biden administration's effort to reduce child poverty. Manchin wants to cut the expanded child tax credit from the bill, with a source telling CNN that he wants to "zero it out."                                                                                   , There are many reasons that Senate Democrats are not ready to vote to pass the Build Back Better legislation in addition to the holdup with Manchin. The legislative text is not yet finalized, a parliamentary review of the bill to ensure Democrats can pass it on a party-line vote is not complete and other policy issues have yet to be resolved, including how to deal with a controversial state and local tax deduction. , But cutting the child tax credit is a nonstarter for Biden, sources note, and that's been the central issue of disagreement, though there are several others outstanding, in the discussions between the two over the last few days.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Manchin explains his position                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , On Wednesday evening, Manchin provided his most detailed rationale yet as to why he's still at odds with Biden over the Build Back Better plan, telling CNN that his demand is that the bill must not exceed $1.75 trillion.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The West Virginia Democrat said that he's objecting to a one-year extension of the child tax credit because he believes it hides the true cost of a program that will likely be extended year after year. He said if Democrats want to extend it, there should be a 10-year extension in order to be transparent to the public.                                                                                                    , Manchin's concerns about leaving the child tax credit in the Build Back Better bill have to do with how it impacts the overall cost of the legislation, according to a source familiar with the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Manchin isn't explicitly telling Biden to remove any specific policy, according to the source, but he has made clear that these expensive provisions are not going to fit to keep the bill at $1.75 trillion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The President's framework would extend the credit for one year, affecting more than 35 million Americans for households earning up to $35,000 per year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But Manchin has said that temporary programs do not reflect the true cost to taxpayers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Asked why not just vote against future extensions of the child tax credit and agree to a one-year extension now, Manchin said: "I want to make sure that we're upfront, transparent with the public. That's all."                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But extending the tax credit for the next decade would blow up the price tag and require wholesale changes to a bill that has been negotiated for months. Manchin indicated that if it increases the price tag and they want to keep the child tax credit, Democrats should drop other programs to make it all fit under $1.75 trillion.                                                                                           , "We have $1.75 to work within," Manchin said. "So pick your priorities and let's do it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Multiple sources say Manchin suggested to Biden moving the extension of the tax credit through a separate track -- something Democrats see as a nonstarter given that it would need at least 10 Republican votes to advance outside of the current budget process.                                                                                                                                                                 , Manchin suggested Wednesday evening they could purse that separate legislative track, but it's still a move opposed by the White House and many Democrats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "The child tax credit, I believe in that, I really think it works great to help people, families, because I've always been for that, OK? And let's find out what we can work something -- work it out," Manchin said Wednesday evening. "I think there's been different variations of child tax credit for the Republicans and Democrats, and we can work it out."                                                                 , How the child tax credit works                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The enhanced child tax credit, which was created as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package in March, is in effect only for 2021, and many Democrats are hoping to extend it through 2022 as part of the social safety net expansion bill.                                                                                                                                                                            , In total, the expanded credit provides up to $3,600 for each younger child and up to $3,000 for each older one per year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The full credit is available for heads of households earning up to $112,500 a year and joint filers making up to $150,000, after which it begins to phase out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Notably, the credit was designed to be paid out on a monthly basis, with the administration distributing up to $300 per month for every child under the age of 6, and $250 per month for children ages 6 to 17.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The expanded credit -- and the monthly payments that have been a driver in a significant reduction in child poverty over the course of the year -- is set to expire this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Disagreement between Biden and Manchin over the tax credit underscores how complex and fragile the negotiations are as Democrats attempt to secure passage of the social safety net legislation, a top priority for the President and a centerpiece of his domestic agenda.                                                                                                                                                        , Manchin's support for the bill is critical to its passage, but he has voiced major concerns over its cost and pushed to scale back the sweeping legislation. That has created a significant challenge for Biden, who must find a way to win over the West Virginia Democrat without cutting too many key priorities and alienating liberal Democrats whose votes are also needed.                                                  , Senate Democrats need all 50 members of their caucus to vote for the legislation to pass it under a process known as reconciliation, which would allow it to be approved without Republican support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Democrats push back on possibility of cutting child tax credit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , News that Manchin wants to eliminate funding for the child tax credit in the Build Back Better bill quickly sparked strong pushback from other Senate Democrats on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "It's not going to get zeroed out," said Democratic Sen.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> U.S. oil prices turn higher after Fed policy update - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Oil futures finished higher on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced plans to speed up its reduction of monthly bond purchases and signaled three interest-rate hikes next year, instead of one. Oil was initially trading lower as concerns that the omicron variant of the coronavirus will slow energy demand outweighed support from data showing a bigger-than-expected weekly decline in U.S. crude supplies. The Fed statement suggested that the central bank is "going to be more hawkish than the market originally anticipated," said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group. U.S. benchmark stock indexes "firmed up" following the news, as did oil prices, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors. January West Texas Intermediate crude

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the economy was expected to grow 4.6% this year, down from April’s forecast of 5.8%, as he presented a fiscal update forecasting a smaller-than-expected budget deficit for 2021/22, with part of the spending promised during the campaign likely ending up in next year’s budget. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed Doubles Taper Pace, Sees Three Rate Hikes in 2022 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Federal Reserve announced at its December meeting it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March, paving the way for three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022, as policymakers voiced concerns over persistently high inflation against a backdrop of a steady recovery in the labor market. The central bank doubled the pace of taper to $30 billion a month, putting it on track to conclude it in March 2022. Still, the US central bank noted that risks to the economic outlook remain due to the uncertainty around the Omicron coronavirus variant and its impact on the economy, while reiterating that interest rates will be held at record-low levels until maximum employment is achieved. Officials have revised up the 2022 inflation forecast to 2.6% from 2.2% projected in September, while the unemployment rate is seen falling to 3.5%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed will aggressively dial back its bond buying, sees three rate hikes next year </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The Federal Reserve provided multiple indications Wednesday that its run of ultra-easy policy since the beginning of the Covid pandemic is coming to a close, making aggressive policy moves in response to rising inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , For one, the central bank said it will accelerate the reduction of its monthly bond purchases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Fed will be buying $60 billion of bonds each month starting in January, half the level prior to the November taper and $30 billion less than it had been buying in December. The Fed was tapering by $15 billion a month in November, doubled that in December, then will accelerate the reduction further come 2022.                                                                                                                           , After that wraps up, in late winter or early spring, the central bank expects to start raising interest rates, which were held steady at this week's meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Projections released Wednesday indicate that Fed officials see as many as three rate hikes coming in 2022, with two in the following year and two more in 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Economic developments and changes in the outlook warrant this evolution of monetary policy, which will continue to provide appropriate support for the economy," Chairman Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The Federal Open Market Committee's moves, approved unanimously, represent a substantial adjustment to policy that has been the loosest in its 108-year history. The post-meeting statement noted the impact from inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation," the statement said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The committee sharply ratcheted up its inflation outlook for 2021, pushing it to 5.3% from 4.2% for all items and to 4.4% from 3.7% excluding food and energy. For 2022, the expectation is now 2.6% for headline and 2.7% for core, both up from September.                                                                                                                                                                                        , At the same time, the unemployment rate projection for 2021 came down to 4.3% from 4.8% in September.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The statement noted that "job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemploymentrate has declined substantially."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , However, members came out on the hawkish side of policy moves, with members solidly leaning toward rate hikes. The "dot plot" of individual members rate expectations indicated that just six of the 18 FOMC members saw fewer than three increases next year, and no members saw rates staying where they are now, anchored near zero.                                                                                                             , That vote came even as the statement reaffirmed that the Fed's benchmark overnight borrowing rate would stay near zero "until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment."                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The committee reduced its forecast for economic growth this year, seeing GDP rising 5.5% for 2021, compared with the 5.9% indicated in September. Officials also revised their forecasts in subsequent year, raising 2022 growth to 4% from 3.8% and lowering 2023 to 2.2% from 2.5%.                                                                                                                                                               , The statement again noted that developments with the Covid pandemic, in particular with variants, pose risks to the outlook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Both policy moves came in response to escalating inflation, which is running at its highest level in 39 years for consumer prices. Wholesale prices in November jumped 9.6%, the fastest on record in a sign that inflation pressures are becoming more ingrained and broad based.                                                                                                                                                                  , Fed officials long have stressed that inflation is "transitory," which Powell has defined as unlikely to leave a lasting imprint on the economy. He and other central bank leaders, as well as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have stressed that prices are booming due to pandemic-related factors such as extraordinary demand that has outstripped supply but ultimately will fade.                                                            , However, the term had become a pejorative and the post-meeting statement eliminated it. Powell telegraphed the move during congressional testimony last month, saying "it's probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean."                                                                                                                                                                                 , For the Powell Fed, tightening policy now marks a dramatic pivot off a policy enacted just over a year ago. Known as "flexible average inflation targeting," which meant it would be content with inflation a little above or below its long-held 2% target.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The policy's practical application was that the Fed was willing to let inflation run a little hot in the interest of completely healing the labor market from the hit it took during the pandemic. The Fed's new policy sought employment that was both full and inclusive across racial, gender and economic lines. Officials agreed not to raise interest rates in anticipation of increasing inflation, as the central bank had done in the past., However, as the "transitory" narrative came into question and inflation began to look stronger and more durable, the Fed has had to rethink its intentions and shift gears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The asset purchase taper began in November, with a reduction of $10 billion in Treasury purchases and $5 billion in mortgage-backed securities. That still left the month buys at $70 billion and $35 billion, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , However, the Fed's $8.7 trillion balance sheet increased by just $2 billion over the past four weeks, with Treasury holdings up $52 billion and MBS actually reduced by $23 billion. Over the past 12 months, Treasury holdings have expanded by $978 billion while MBS has risen by $567 billion.                                                                                                                                                  , Under the new terms of a program also known as quantitative easing, the Fed would accelerate the decline of its holdings until it is no longer adding to its portfolio. That would bring QE to an end in the spring and allow the central bank to raise rates anytime after. The Fed has said it likely would not hike rates and continue buying bonds simultaneously, as the two moves would work at cross purposes.                               , From there, the Fed at anytime could start reducing its balance sheet either by selling securities outright, or, in the more likely scenario, begin allowing the proceeds of its current bond holdings to run off each month at a controlled pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Correction: The Fed's $8.7 trillion balance sheet increased by just $2 billion over the past four weeks, with Treasury holdings up $52 billion and MBS actually reduced by $23 billion.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed moves to end bond buying by March, eyes three rate hikes in 2022 - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to speed up a reduction in bond purchases to $30 billion a month so that the program  could end in March instead of the original plan of June. The Fed also penciled in three increases in short-term interest rates in 2022, up from the one move projected in September. In new forecasts, the central bank raised its estimate for inflation next year to 2.6% from 2.2%, using its preferred PCE price gauge. U.S. economic growth was also projected to slow to 4% in 2022 from an estimated 5.5% this year. In its policy statement, the Fed dropped the word "transitory" to describe inflation and it left a key short-term interest rate unchanged near zero. The fed funds rate is expected to end around 0.9% in 2022., If rising gasoline prices are hitting you hard, Christian Walker, son of retired football great and Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker, wants you to know he's feeling the pain as well.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The government has been urged by its official immigration advisers to make it easier for foreign care workers to come to the UK.                                                                                                          , The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said the sector was facing "severe and increasing" problems with hiring and retaining staff after Brexit.                                                                                          , It suggested changes to allow employers to sponsor visas for workers on more than £20,480 a year.                                                                                                                                         , The Home Office said it would consider the recommendation carefully.                                                                                                                                                                      , The proposal was welcomed by several groups in the care sector, who have long argued less stringent rules are needed to boost recruitment.                                                                                                , Research charity Skills for Care estimated last month that just over 11% of vacancies in the sector are currently unfilled.                                                                                                               , The MAC's recommendation came as it published initial findings of a review it is conducting into the effect of Brexit on social care recruitment.                                                                                         , Since the UK left the EU, social care workers from EU countries are no longer automatically eligible to work in the UK and instead have to apply for a visa.                                                                              , The committee said all social care workers should be able to apply under the UK's "shortage occupation list", meaning they need fewer points and a lower salary to meet the criteria.                                                     , They also said they should be able to apply for the government's special visa for health and social care workers.                                                                                                                         , Currently, only senior roles with qualifications above a certain level are eligible for these routes.                                                                                                                                     , The MAC recommended the move to help "alleviate" short-term recruitment problems, which it said were likely to worsen post-Brexit.                                                                                                        , However, it also concluded many issues predated the UK's exit, and "underfunding" of the sector was "the underlying cause" of difficulties.                                                                                               , The recommendation to widen access to the shortage occupation list was welcomed by industry groups Care England and the Homecare Association.                                                                                             , Mike Padgham, chairman of the Independent Care Group, also said a relaxation of immigration rules "can't come soon enough".                                                                                                               , He added that the sector was already "on its knees" trying to cope with self-isolation caused by the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid.                                                                                              , Migration Minister Kevin Foster said the government's post-Brexit immigration system was "delivering on the people's priorities of getting businesses to invest in the domestic workforce while attracting those with the skills we need.", He said senior roles were already eligible for the easier visa routes, "but businesses need to make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce, including offering hard working care workers the rewarding packages they deserve.", A trip full of surprises as Romesh tries an adventure closer to home                                                                                                                                                                      , Killing Escobar: An incredible true story of one man's mission                                                                                                                                                                            , © 2021 BBC.

"While gas prices are starting to decline, there is still plenty of food inflation. There is risk now that inflation has become entrenched in households’ psyches, which further pressures policymakers at the Fed to be more aggressive in their tightening stance." </td>

Newly uncovered documents reportedly confirm long-standing suspicions that tech giant Huawei has been more deeply entangled with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) surveillance operations than it has previously admitted, the Post reports.                                                    , "I don’t have a comment on the specifics of this report but President Biden and the administration continue to believe Huawei is a national security threat," a National Security Council spokesperson told Fox. "That is why it remains on the entity list and why this administration designated it under E.O. 14032 for operating in the defense and related [material] and/or surveillance technology sectors of the PRC economy.", BIDEN COMMERCE NOMINEE SIGNED AGREEMENT THAT CLEARED HUAWEI CFO OF FRAUD CHARGES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The company, which has historically denied collaborating closely with the Chinese government, has long attempted to project itself as a basic supplier of tech resources and network maintenance. Products produced by the company have gone through countless boycotts and bans worldwide due to information security concerns.                                                                                                      , The White House has serious national security concerns about Huawei.

The United States has in place the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which restricts Huawei’s access to chips from anywhere with US tooling and designing that can be used for 5G devices," the NSC spokesperson continued.                                                                                                 , The spokesperson also touched on international efforts to divest from Huawei infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "This is having a direct impact as Huawei is running out of its advanced chip stockpile. Dozens of countries around the world are taking steps to exclude Huawei from their 5G network buildouts as well," the spokesperson said.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The Chinese tech company denied the findings of the Post's investigation, saying that it did not even have knowledge of the projects that the Post report linked it to the CCP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "Huawei has no knowledge of the projects mentioned in the Washington Post report," the tech company said in a statement to the Post. "Like all other major service providers, Huawei provides cloud platform services that comply with common industry standards."                                                                                                                                                                    , Fox News' Pat Ward contributed reporting  </td>

Middle-income earners also saw a large increase in expenses, with an increased consumption expenditure of $4,351, or an increase of 6.8%.                                                   , "Since higher-income groups had a bigger increase in expenditures in all categories, they also saw a bigger increase in total expenditure," the analysis said. "However, because of variation in the composition of consumption bundles, we find that higher-income households had smaller percentage increases in their total expenditure."                                                                                       , The Penn Wharton analysis comes on the heels of a new government report that revealed consumer prices soared 6.8% in November from the previous year, the fastest pace since June 1982, when inflation hit 7.1%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , HOUSE GOP REELECTION ARM SPOTLIGHTS 'HISTORIC INFLATION' CAUSING 'NOT TO MERRY CHRISTMAS'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Price increases were widespread: Energy prices jumped 3.5% in November and are up 33.3% year over year. Gasoline is a stunning 58.1% higher than it was a year ago. Food prices have also climbed 6.1% higher over the year, while used car and truck prices – a major component of the inflation increase – are up 31%.                                                                                                           , President Biden addresses the 76th Session of the U.N.

The White House has blamed the price spike on supply-chain bottlenecks and other pandemic-induced disruptions in the economy, while Republicans have pinned it on the president's massive spending agenda., A separate Gallup analysis published at the beginning of the month shows that about 45% of households are being hurt by the recent price spike. Roughly 10% said the increase had affected their standard of living, while another 35% described the hardship as "moderate."                                                                                                                                                       , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The effect is more pronounced among lower-income families: 71% of those making less than $40,000 a year say they experienced hardship, compared with 29% of those earning more than $100,000 a year. What's more, 28% of Americans who are considered lower-income said the hardship they are experiencing is severe and hindering their ability to maintain their current standard of living.                                     , It's unclear when consumers can expect to see inflation begin to slow, with prices for an array of goods continuously climbing higher. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s main stock index, the S&amp;P/TSX, extended losses for the sixth consecutive session on Wednesday, in line with most major stock indices overseas, as inflation and omicron fears took over market sentiment ahead of a highly awaited US Fed meeting later in the day. Consumer prices in Canada rose 4.7% yoy in November, the same pace as in October and remained the steepest yearly increase since early 2003, as widely expected. Meanwhile, energy stocks fell roughly 1% as crude prices were pressured by growing expectations that supply will outpace demand in 2022, while miners shed 1% amid a weaker bullion.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the Canadian 10-year government bond traded around 1.39%, not far from an 11-week low of 1.385% hit on September 27th, as investors crowded into bonds while trying to assess what will be the impact of the new coronavirus variant on the economic recovery after some countries widened restrictions to curb its spread. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the economy was expected to grow 4.6% this year, down from April’s forecast of 5.8%, as he presented a fiscal update forecasting a smaller-than-expected budget deficit for 2021/22, with part of the spending promised during the campaign likely ending up in next year’s budget. Also, in its last meeting, the BoC said that the new variant Omicron had raised the uncertainty around the economic recovery and maintained its guidance of start rates hike during the middle quarters of 2022, dashing some investors' expectations of a shift for a more hawkish policy stance. </td>
