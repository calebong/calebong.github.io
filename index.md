   <td style="text-align:left;"> Buyers revive interest in city flats after return to office </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Demand for flats is reviving in UK cities, as property buyers return to more settled working patterns, new research shows.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Interest in flats overtook searches for terraced houses since the start of this year, property portal Rightmove said.                                                                                                                                                                                           , But the hunt for extra space, which dominated during the pandemic, remains a key factor for buyers and renters.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "Annexe" is buyers' most popular search term, Rightmove said, with garages and gardens also high on the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The property website analysed its data for the BBC to show how buyers and renters looking for properties were shifting their priorities.                                                                                                                                                                        , A picture has emerged of a renewed interest in urban and commuter areas, and a shift in the type of property being sought.                                                                                                                                                                                      , In January last year, a terraced house was the most popular, it said, ahead of detached houses and flats. A year on, flats recorded the highest demand.                                                                                                                                                         , "In the initial stages of the pandemic, houses stole the show, as people looked for as much room as possible. As restrictions have eased, being closer to city amenities has become more of a priority," said Tim Bannister, Rightmove's property data expert.                                                  , During lockdowns, data showed property hunters wanted countryside and coastal properties with gardens, and extra space indoors to work.                                                                                                                                                                         , In the last five years, house prices have risen fastest for detached houses in predominantly rural locations, according to research by the Nationwide Building Society.                                                                                                                                         , The average price rise for a rural property of 29% over that period, outstripped the 18% increase in urban areas. Average house prices in North Devon rose by 24% last year alone.                                                                                                                              , But spacious, rural homes have been in short supply. As they became less affordable too, some of the focus has shifted back to commuter areas and city centres. That shift has accelerated since the start of this year as workers began to spend more time at their office desks rather than the kitchen table., Market commentators also suggest students and office-based first-time buyers are driving up demand in cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Jack Hunter is one of those first-time buyers. The 26-year-old said he was "ecstatic" to have managed to buy a flat near the centre of Glasgow in recent weeks.                                                                                                                                                 , "Friends have been to 30 viewings and made eight offers and are still looking," said Mr Hunter, who works in IT and technology sales.                                                                                                                                                                           , "I don't know if this will be my forever home, but I am glad to be on the ladder."                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr Hunter said the location and access to a parking space were significant positives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Glasgow, like many UK cities, saw a race for space among buyers during Covid lockdowns. Although the impact was not as dramatic as in London, estate agents say there has been a rebound for city properties.                                                                                                   , John O'Malley, from agency Pacitti Jones, said that demand for Glasgow's tenement flats had returned, with first-time buyers looking for something affordable and close to the city centre.                                                                                                                     , Higher demand for flats to buy is mirrored in the rental market with higher demand for city centre properties to rent.                                                                                                                                                                                          , The number of renters in rural areas enquiring about available properties in cities has jumped 52% compared to January last year, while the number of renters in cities enquiring about rural properties has dropped 10%, the Rightmove data shows.                                                             , A lack of homes available to buy or rent has been the biggest problem across the market, according to experts. This has driven up prices, even as the higher cost of living bites.                                                                                                                              , A survey of 3,000 people by the Nationwide indicated that 38% of those asked were either in the process of moving or considering a move - far outstripping the number of homes on the market. Only one in five of them was doing so to try to reduce their spending on housing.                                 , On Friday, the lender said UK property prices had increased by 12.1% in the last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Official forecasts suggest that, although the pace of growth is expected to slow owing to the pressure on household budgets, there is little prospect of a fall in house prices.                                                                                                                                , The ambition of adding value to a home, as well as the long-term prospect for many people of working at home for some of the week, has influenced the priorities of potential buyers.                                                                                                                           , Analysis of search terms by users on the Rightmove website indicates that buyers at the start of their enquiries show the most interest in whether a property has an "annexe". The next most popular terms are "acre" to check space, and "garage" possibly for conversion.                                     , Renters have different requirements. Top of the list is "pets" to check they are permitted by landlords, followed by wanting to know if the place is "furnished".                                                                                                                                               , A garden is still in renters' and buyers' top five search terms so, despite the pull of the city lights, the Covid-inspired demand for green space is far from extinguished.                                                                                                                                    , Back to Back 90s tunes to soundtrack your weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Gary, Micah and Alan rank their top ten English football derbies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , There's something for everyone on BBC iPlayer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , © 2022 BBC.

Internal company records indicated that more than 2,300 rodents had been collected between March and September of 2021, according to an F.D.A. report.                                           , Federal inspectors said the company was aware of an “increased presence of rodents” in the facility since at least January 2020.                                                                                                                                                          , The suit filed by the Arkansas attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, says Family Dollar willfully neglected the proper care of the West Memphis facility and misled consumers about potentially contaminated products, all while unfairly profiting from their sale.                         , Ms. Rutledge said her office was seeking up to $10,000 for each violation of the state’s deceptive trade practices act and a revocation of the company’s authorization to do business in the state.                                                                                       , “We don’t want to wipe out a source of groceries and medicines, but if those groceries and medicines are not safe, then we need someone else providing that service,” Ms. Rutledge said.                                                                                                  , A spokesman for Dollar Tree, the parent company of Family Dollar, which is also named in the suit, did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. The company issued a voluntary recall of products stored at the distribution center.                                              , Family Dollar lacked written procedures for quality control and equipment cleaning at the distribution center, and had no system to track reports of contaminated products sent to stores, according to the F.D.A. report.                                                                , Federal inspectors found live and dead rodents in “various states of decay,” rodent droppings and odors, evidence of gnawing and nesting, and other unsanitary conditions throughout the facility, the report said.                                                                       , Rodent droppings — sometimes “too numerous to count” — were discovered on pallets and cases containing mixed nuts, mouthwash and Jell-O, among other food and drug products. Rodent contamination can cause salmonella and fatal infections, the agency said.                             , The suit said other Family Dollar stores across the country have in the past been forced to close because of rodent infestations.                                                                                                                                                         , These closures, along with the revelations at the West Memphis distribution center, reveal “a much larger and troubling pattern of willful and intentional neglect and deceptive and unconscionable business practices,” the suit says.                                                   , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Actress and activist Angelina Jolie paid a surprise visit to a boarding school and medical institution in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday, according to Maksym Kozytskyy, head of Lviv's regional military administration.                                    , "In one of the medical institutions, she has visited children who suffered from a missile strike by the Russian military on the Kramatorsk train station. She was very moved by their stories. One girl was even able to tell Ms. Jolie about her dream privately," Kozytskyy said., Jolie also visited a boarding school in Lviv, which has become a way point for displaced people, humanitarian aid and weapons. She told the children she'd come back, Kozytskyy said.                                                                                              , At Lviv's main railway station, where Ukrainian residents arrive with regularity, she talked to volunteers providing medical and psychological assistance.                                                                                                                         , "She thanked them for their work," Kozytskyy said.

       two years ago told shareholders that Powell belonged "on the pedestal" with former Fed chief Paul Volcker, for his quick response to the danger to the economy and financial system from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking at this year's Berkshire annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett doubled down on his praise of the current Fed chief, saying, "in my book, Jay Powell is a hero." Buffett said that it would have been human nature for a Fed chief to engage in "thumbsucking" when presented with a threat on the scale of the pandemic instead of taking action, which would have been disastrous for the economy. Powell has faced criticism for maintaining loose monetary policy as inflation pressures built up, with the Fed now weighing an aggressive round of rate increases and other measures aimed at tightening monetary policy., The Berkshire CEO and company Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told shareholders why they put billions to work buying stocks, including Chevron and Activision Blizzard: "We found some things we preferred owning to Treasury bills.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , William Watts is MarketWatch’s senior markets writer.

The pair's past criticism has attracted barbs from crypto enthusiasts, with venture capitalist Peter Thiel recently calling Buffett an "enemy" of the digital asset and part of a "financial gerontocracy" working to undermine bitcoin's adoption., An ugly end to a brutal April on Friday saw the S&amp;P 500 post its second correction --- a drop of 10% from a recent peak --- so far this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , William Watts is MarketWatch’s senior markets writer.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Warren Buffett on Saturday said Berkshire Hathaway has been increasing its stake in Activision Blizzard in a merger arbitrage play, betting that Microsoft's proposed acquisition of the video game company will close.                                                       , Berkshire now owns about 9.5% of Activision shares, Buffett said at the company's annual shareholder meeting.                                                                                                                                                                 , "Occasionally I'll see an arbitrage deal and do it," Berkshire's chairman and CEO said. "Occasionally it looks like the odds are in our favor, but absolutely we can lose money on that company, fairly large sums of money, depending on what happened if the deal blows up.", In January, Microsoft announced intentions to buy Activision for $95 per share. Activision closed at $75.60 per share on Friday.                                                                                                                                              , Buffett said he has been buying more shares of Activision since the deal was announced as the stock is trading way below Microsoft's offer. Buying at these levels will yield a bigger return if the deal closes.                                                             , "If the deal goes through, we make some money, and if the deal doesn't go through, who knows what happens," Buffett said.                                                                                                                                                     , "We don't know what the Justice Department will do, we don't know what the EU will do, we don't know what 30 other jurisdictions will do. One thing we do know is that Microsoft has the money," he said.                                                                     , In the fourth quarter of 2021, Berkshire first purchased about $1 billion worth of Activision Blizzard stock, in a bet the company was undervalued.                                                                                                                           , Buffett has said Berkshire "had no prior knowledge" of Microsoft's plan to buy the company when Berkshire made its initial investment.                                                                                                                                        , Check out all of the CNBC Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting coverage here.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Got a confidential news tip?

Despite a shift in public perception about the cryptocurrency, Buffett still wouldn't buy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "Whether it goes up or down in the next year, or five or 10 years, I don't know. But the one thing I'm pretty sure of is that it doesn't produce anything," Buffett said. "It's got a magic to it and people have attached magics to lots of things."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Even bitcoin enthusiasts tend to regard the cryptocurrency as a passive asset that investors buy and hold and hope to see increase in price over a long period. Buffet himself commented that there's "nobody" that's short on bitcoin, everyone is a long-term holder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , For more sophisticated crypto investors, some coins offer a way for them to use their crypto productively — either through lending, or as collateral — to create additional portfolio benefits. However, they're still young, highly speculative and haven't broken into the mainstream like bitcoin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Buffett elaborated on why he doesn't see value in bitcoin, comparing it to things that generate other types of value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Bank of America cuts S&amp;P 500 target as 'specter of a recession looms'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Jeremy Siegel says the struggling stock market now looks attractive for long-term investors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Cathie Wood bought more than $20 million worth of Teladoc as stock tanked Thursday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Cathie Wood fears takeovers for her Ark stocks right now because they won't get a fair price                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "If you said… for a 1% interest in all the farmland in the United States, pay our group $25 billion, I'll write you a check this afternoon," Buffett said. "[For] $25 billion I now own 1% of the farmland. [If] you offer me 1% of all the apartment houses in the country and you want another $25 billion, I'll write you a check, it's very simple. Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25 I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I'd have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything. The apartments are going to produce rent and the farms are going to produce food.", Investors for years have been puzzled over how to value bitcoin in part because of its potential to serve different functions. In Western markets it has been established as an investment asset, particularly in the past year as rates and inflation have been on the rise. In other markets, people still see enormous potential for its use as digital cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Assets, to have value, have to deliver something to somebody. And there's only one currency that's accepted. You can come up with all kinds of things — we can put up Berkshire coins... but in the end, this is money," he said, holding up a $20 bill. "And there's no reason in the world why the United States government… is going to let Berkshire money replace theirs."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Both Buffett and Charlie Munger have made hostile comments toward bitcoin in the past. Most famously, Buffett said bitcoin is "probably rat poison squared." Munger doubled down on that sentiment Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "In my life, I try and avoid things that are stupid and evil and make me look bad in comparison to somebody else – and bitcoin does all three," Munger said. "In the first place, it's stupid because it's still likely to go to zero. It's evil because it undermines the Federal Reserve System... and third, it makes us look foolish compared to the Communist leader in China. He was smart enough to ban bitcoin in China."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Got a confidential news tip?

       Vice Chairman Charlie Munger on Saturday said the Robinhood trading app was "unraveling" after engaging in practices he labeled "disgusting." "Look what happened to Robinhood from its peak to its trough," Munger said at Berkshire's annual meeting. "Wasn't that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen." Munger, who has previously blasted Robinhood Markets Inc. 
        HOOD,
        -2.82%,
       saying it encouraged a casino-like approach to investing, on Saturday criticized what he called the platform's "short-term gambling and big commissions and hidden kickbacks and so on." Robinhood didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company in February 2021 deemed an earlier round of criticism by Munger "disappointing and elitist." Robinhood shares have dropped 86% from their August closing high. "Now it's unraveling. God is getting just," Munger said. , Our call of the day from TS Lombard chief economist Steven Blitz warns that the "golden era of Fed-controlled equity markets" is nearing an end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , William Watts is MarketWatch’s senior markets writer.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger had some advice for a young attendee at Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday.

        BRK.B,

       is a top "enemy" of bitcoin and part of a "finance gerontocracy" holding back the cryptocurrency's adoption., By the end of trading on Friday, the selloff had gotten worse and we were staring at the worst start to a year since the Great Depression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

       Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett said the company would be able to preserve its culture long after he's left the scene. Responding to a question at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett, 91, said Berkshire has "a culture that a) has worked and b) has the shares and shareholders that will carry it a long way." While there would inevitably be intense speculation about the company's path in his absence, the company's structure means "nobody can take us over for a long, long time, and we would hope that maybe the superiority of this culture might be better understood" as time passes. Future generations of managers will be "custodians of a culture that's embedded," he said. "We have got the directors and share ownership...and the size that can ward off any attempts to change the culture," he said., April showers apparently bring dramatically lower markets on Wall Street, and this month's slump for the S&amp;P 500 was a doozy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , William Watts is MarketWatch’s senior markets writer.

        -2.55%
       was able to quickly buy a large stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp.
        OXY,
        -3.40%
       during the first quarter as the market has been "a casino" to an "extraordinary degree" over the past couple years, said Berkshire chief executive officer Warren Buffett at the conglomerate's annual meeting in Omaha on Saturday. He said Berkshire bought a 14% stake in about two weeks. "I find that just incredible," said Buffett. "You wouldn't be able to do that with Berkshire." Buffett said that "overwhelmingly," large U.S. companies have become "poker chips," with people buying and selling call options as opposed to making investments. He said the "gambling" nature of the stock market enabled Berkshire to quickly buy 14% of "a business that's been around for decades," Buffett said.

       Vice Chairman Charlie Munger underlined his opposition to a proposal that would force Warren Buffett to give up his role as chairman of the conglomerate. Backers of the proposal "have some professor somewhere who thinks American businesses run better if" the CEO and chairman roles are split in two, he said at Berkshire's annual meeting. "To me, it's the most ridiculous criticism I ever heard," Munger said. It's as if the ancient Greek hero Odysseus returned home only to be told by someone they didn't "like the way you were holding that spear when you won that battle," he said. A proposal from the National Legal and Policy Center calls for an independent chairman, saying that the roles are "greatly diminished" when held by one person. Buffett became CEO of Berkshire in 1965, and has been chairman since 1970. Under the proposal, Buffett could continue to serve as CEO. The proposal, which has been endorsed by CalPERS, the country's largest state public pension fund, is opposed by Berkshire's board and is expected to fail. , Tesla shares opened higher Thursday then promptly fell.

Ten days earlier, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, had made an unsolicited bid to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share. Alarmed by the out-of-the-blue proposal and uncertain if the offer was for real, the social media company had adopted a “poison pill,” a defensive maneuver to stop Mr. Musk from accumulating more of its shares.                                                                                                                  , But by that Sunday, Twitter was running out of choices. Mr. Musk had lined up financing for his offer and was needling the company with his tweets. And after hours of discussions and reviewing Twitter’s plans and finances, the questions the 11 board members were wrestling with — could the company be worth more than $54.20 a share? would any other bidder emerge? — were all leading to one dissatisfying answer: No.                                           , Less than 24 hours later, the blockbuster $44 billion deal was announced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “What I’ll tell you is that based on the analysis and the perception of risk, certainty and value, the board unanimously decided the offer from Elon represented the best value for our shareholders,” Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, told the company’s more than 7,000 employees on Monday in a call that The New York Times listened to.                                                                                                                             , A central mystery of Mr. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter is how the company’s board went from installing a poison pill to agreeing to sell to him in just 11 days. In most megadeals, the adoption of a poison pill leads to a protracted fight. The tactic is a clear signal that a company intends to battle. Negotiations then drag out. Sometimes buyers walk away.                                                                                                     , But interviews with a dozen people close to the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly, show just how few options Twitter’s board had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , And while there are many types of buyers that deal advisers are prepared to fend off — hostile ones, aggressive ones, those who lowball and then are willing to negotiate — Twitter faced an acquirer in Mr. Musk who was not in any deal playbook. In essence, he was an “unknown quantity” acquirer, one who would not budge on price and was prepared to publicly trash the company and wield his considerable fortune to get an agreement done with limited diligence., “Normal buyers might actually say, ‘Well, you know, we actually want to talk to the folks inside and see how is the business going and get more data than is available to the public,’” said Edward Rock, a professor of corporate governance at the New York University School of Law. “What was interesting,” he said, is that the Twitter board “reached a deal in a short period of time — and such an unconditional deal.” He called the deal’s speed “unusual.”     , Twitter declined to comment on its board discussions. Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The groundwork for a deal was laid in January, when Mr. Musk began buying Twitter stock, eventually building up a more than 9 percent stake in the company. When he made his holdings known in a securities filing in early April, Twitter offered him a board seat. Mr. Musk briefly agreed to the idea before changing his mind.                                                                                                                                        , Instead, on the evening of April 13, Mr. Musk sent a text message to Mr. Taylor, who has been Twitter’s chairman since 2016. (Mr. Taylor is also a co-chief executive of the software company Salesforce.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “I am going to send you an offer letter tonight, it will be public in the morning,” Mr. Musk wrote to Mr. Taylor. The exchange was included in a securities filing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The next morning, a bare-bones offer letter arrived from Mr. Musk. It declared his intention to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, but it had few details about his plans for the company or the financing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Mr. Musk hired the investment bank Morgan Stanley, tapping the services of two bankers, Anthony Armstrong and Michael Grimes. Mr. Grimes, who heads Morgan Stanley’s technology banking practice, led the 2012 public stock offering of Facebook and other tech companies, while Mr. Armstrong was a longtime tech banker who had recently been promoted to company vice chairman.                                                                                        , Twitter’s board did not quite know how to handle Mr. Musk’s bid, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Mr. Musk did not have a track record of buying companies and had not followed through on some deals, including one in 2018 when he tweeted that he would take his carmaker, Tesla, private but then did not do so.                                                                                                                                    , A day after Mr. Musk’s bid became public, Twitter’s board voted unanimously to slow him down by authorizing the poison pill. To defend itself, Twitter turned to Goldman Sachs, its longtime banker, and JPMorgan Chase. For legal advice, it added the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett to supplement its longtime law firm, Wilson Sonsini.                                                                                                                          , JPMorgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Simpson Thacher didn’t immediately have comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Mr. Musk was undeterred. His bankers began trying to corral tens of billions of dollars in financing for a Twitter deal. His advisers presented prospective lenders with a few pages vaguely outlining Mr. Musk’s goals. The billionaire also talked directly with banks, a person with knowledge of the calls said.                                                                                                                                                      , That helped persuade Citigroup, Bank of America, BNP Paribas and other banks to put their money in. Despite a lack of details about Mr. Musk’s plans, lenders were reassured in part by the entrepreneur’s past successes and wealth, the person said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Musk also campaigned on Twitter for a deal. He hinted that he would take his proposal directly to shareholders in a so-called tender offer if the company’s board did not accept his bid. On April 16, he tweeted, “Love me tender.” Three days later, he tweeted “____ is the Night,” a reference to the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, “Tender Is the Night.”                                                                                                           , Twitter’s board fractured. On April 16, Jack Dorsey, a Twitter founder who stepped down as chief executive in November and is a board member, tweeted that the board had been the “consistent dysfunction of the company.” When asked by a Twitter user whether he was allowed to say that, Mr. Dorsey responded, “no.”                                                                                                                                                   , Mr. Dorsey’s criticism rankled other board members and Twitter executives, said two people who worked on the deal. Mr. Taylor asked Mr. Dorsey to stop tweeting negatively, one person said. Mr. Dorsey continued posting references to Twitter’s board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , A spokesman for Mr. Dorsey declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Taylor declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , On April 21, Mr. Musk lined up $46.5 billion in financing. He had obtained commitments from Morgan Stanley and other lenders for $13 billion in debt financing, while another group of banks promised $12.5 billion in loans against his stock in Tesla. Mr. Musk added that he would use another $21 billion in cash to buy the rest of Twitter’s equity.                                                                                                                , The financing forced Twitter’s board to take Mr. Musk seriously. No other offers for the company had emerged, two people familiar with the deliberations said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A blockbuster deal. Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, capped what seemed an improbable attempt by the famously mercurial billionaire to buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion. Here’s how the deal unfolded:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The initial offer. Mr. Musk made an unsolicited bid worth more than $40 billion for the influential social network, saying that he wanted to make Twitter a private company and that he wanted people to be able to speak more freely on the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The response. Twitter’s board countered Mr. Musk’s offer with a defense mechanism known as a “poison pill.” This well-worn corporate tactic makes a company less palatable to a potential acquirer by making it more expensive for them to buy shares above a certain threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Securing financing. Though his original offer had scant details and was received skeptically by Wall Street, Mr. Musk moved swiftly to secure commitments worth $46.5 billion to finance his bid, putting pressure on Twitter’s board to take his advances seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Striking a deal. With the financing in place, Twitter’s board met with Mr. Musk to discuss his offer. The two sides soon reached a deal, with the social media company agreeing to sell itself for $54.20 a share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , What’s next? Shareholders will vote on the offer, which will also be reviewed by regulators. The deal is expected to take three to six months to close. In the meantime, scrutiny is likely to be intense and several questions remain about Mr. Musk’s plans for the company.                                                                                                                                                                                            , At Twitter, Mr. Taylor weighed employee uncertainty and the societal implications of a deal versus the board’s fiduciary duty, people with knowledge of the situation said. That meant making a decision based on whether Twitter could reasonably achieve a value better than what Mr. Musk had put forward.                                                                                                                                                             , Mr. Taylor and other board members debated whether Twitter’s user and revenue growth prospects were realistic. The San Francisco company, which had not turned a profit for eight of the last 10 years, had set aggressive business targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Twitter had also initially benefited from the pandemic, attracting a surge of new users and sending its stock to more than $77 in February 2021. But its advertising business lagged those of competitors, and as the pandemic boost wore off, its shares fell below $40.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Still, some board members were wary about having a saviorlike figure such as Mr. Musk swoop in, especially since Twitter had already relied upon such figures — including Mr. Dorsey — to right the ship, two people said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mr. Musk began preparing to start a tender offer for Twitter, said one person close to the discussions. He had a potential ally on Twitter’s board in Egon Durban, a co-chief executive of the private equity firm Silver Lake, who had worked with Mr. Musk on his failed 2018 effort to take Tesla private. But Mr. Durban made clear to the board that Silver Lake was not teaming up with Mr. Musk to provide financing for a takeover, two people said.              , Through a spokesman, Mr. Durban declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Last Saturday, Mr. Musk spoke with Mr. Taylor and threatened to take his offer directly to Twitter’s shareholders, without explicitly saying he would start a hostile bid, a person with knowledge of the call said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , On Sunday, Twitter’s board concluded that it had to make a deal with Mr. Musk. The company could not hit $54.20 a share on its own, board members agreed, and no white knight was coming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Taylor told Mr. Musk that Twitter would proceed with a sale, a person with knowledge of the call said. Even so, Mr. Musk sent a letter to Mr. Taylor threatening a hostile bid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Twitter’s advisers homed in on protections for the deal, like a breakup fee if Mr. Musk walked away and a six-month timeline to closing the deal, which could be particularly important if technology stocks continue to fall. Mr. Musk’s advisers shored up financing details, with the billionaire personally signing off on each point, a person familiar with the negotiations said.                                                                                  , After the agreement was announced on Monday afternoon, Mr. Musk took a victory lap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “Yesss!!!” he tweeted, posting emojis of rockets, stars and hearts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Anupreeta Das, Maureen Farrell and Kate Conger contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Advertisement </td>

As usual, Mino made us proud and never realized it."                                                , No cause of death was announced in the statement posted by the Raiola family on Saturday.                                                                                                                 , "Mino touched so many lives through his work and wrote a new chapter in the history of modern football. His presence will forever be missed," it added.                                                   , "Mino's mission of making football a better place for players will continue with the same passion."                                                                                                       , Raiola represented some of the biggest names in world football, including players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba and Erling Haaland.                                                              , He amassed a huge fortune for organizing some of the most expensive transfers in history, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $84.7 million in December 2020.                                         , Despite his success, Raiola was a controversial figure with some unhappy with his outspoken nature and for the amount of money he demanded for players he represented.                                    , "My father said to me when I was a small boy that 50 percent of the people in your life will love you and 50 percent will hate you," Raiola said in an interview with The Athletic in 2021.               , "So I am not here to be loved and liked by everybody.

"They don't make money unless people do things, and they get a piece of them. They make a lot more money when people are gambling than when they are investing."                                                                                                                                                                     , Buffett bemoaned that large American companies have "became poker chips" for market speculation. He cited soaring use of call options, saying that brokers make more money from these bets than simple investing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Still, the situation can result in market dislocations that give Berkshire Hathaway an opportunity, he said.

Some $7 billion of that went to snap up shares of Occidental, bringing up his stake to more than 14% of the oil producer's shares.                                                      , "That's why markets do crazy things, and occasionally Berkshire gets a chance to do something," Buffett said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Bank of America cuts S&amp;P 500 target as 'specter of a recession looms'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Jeremy Siegel says the struggling stock market now looks attractive for long-term investors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Cathie Wood bought more than $20 million worth of Teladoc as stock tanked Thursday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Cathie Wood fears takeovers for her Ark stocks right now because they won't get a fair price                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "It's almost a mania of speculation," Charlie Munger, 98, Buffett's long-time partner and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, chimed in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "We have people who know nothing about stocks being advised by stock brokers who know even less," Munger said. "It's an incredible, crazy situation. I don't think any wise country would want this outcome. Why would you want your country's stock to trade on a casino?"                                                                                                                                                                                  , Retail traders flooded into the stock market during the pandemic, boosting share prices to records. Last year, the frenzy was fueled further by meme-inspired trading from Reddit message boards. But the stock market has turned this year, putting many of those new at-home traders in the red. The Nasdaq Composite, which holds many of the favorite names of small traders, is in a bear market, down more than 23% from its high after an April crush., Warren Buffett has a long history of deriding investment bankers and their institutions –saying that they encourage mergers and spinoffs to reap fees, rather than improve companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , He typically shuns investment bankers for his acquisitions, calling them pricey "money shufflers." Buffett's $848.02 per share offer for insurer Alleghany reportedly excludes Goldman's advisory fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Earlier in the session, he noted that Berkshire would always be cash-rich, and in times of need, would be "better than the banks" at extending credit lines to companies. An audience member made an inaudible comment while he was talking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "Was that a banker screaming?"

       went on a roughly $40 billion securities buying spree between Feb. 21 and March 15, but has since reverted back to its more "lethargic" pace, Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told shareholders at the conglomerate's annual meeting Saturday. Buffett went on to note that Berkshire still ended the first quarter with around $103 billion in cash versus around $144 billion at the end of 2021. While there's a lot of focus on Berkshire's cash pile, Buffett said the company "will always have a lot of cash," adding that rather than commercial paper or other holdings, most of it will remain parked in highly liquid Treasury bills. Buffett said the desire for a big cushion is because there have been a "few times in history where if you don't have it you don't get to play the next day." , It has been a rough April for investors, but there is still reason for cheer, says our call of the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , William Watts is MarketWatch’s senior markets writer.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neil Parish: UK Conservative politician resigns after admitting watching porn in Parliament - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> London (CNN)A Member of Parliament in British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, Neil Parish, said Saturday he will resign after admitting twice watching pornography in the House of Commons.                                                                                                                                                  , Parish told the BBC the first time he viewed the explicit material was an accident after searching online for farm vehicles. The second time was deliberate and a "moment of madness," the 65-year-old said.                                                                                                                                                    , Johnson's government is currently engulfed in numerous scandals, just days ahead of crucial local elections. The Prime Minister himself has been fined by police for breaching his own Covid rules during the 2020 lockdown, and faces an investigation into whether he misled Parliament about parties in Downing Street.                                      , And last week, his party was accused of having a serious misogyny problem, after one of his backbenchers anonymously claimed to a newspaper that Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, distracted Johnson in the House of Commons by crossing and uncrossing her legs, similar to Sharon Stone's character in the movie "Basic Instinct.", Parish admitted on Saturday that his behavior in Parliament was "totally wrong." "The situation was that I, funnily enough, it was tractors that I was looking at. And so I did get into another website that had a sort of very similar name. And I watched it for a bit which I shouldn't have done.                                                          , "My biggest crime is that on another occasion I went in a second time. And that was deliberate."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , He described it as a "moment of madness and also totally wrong."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The politician's local Conservative association in Tiverton and Honiton, in western England, said in a statement Saturday: "We would like to take this opportunity to thank Neil Parish for his service to our communities over the past twelve years. We support his decision to step down as our Member of Parliament."                                       , </td>

Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, said this past week that he would pay roughly $44 billion to take Twitter private. If the deal closes, it would become the country’s second-largest buyout on record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Mr. Musk is departing from the traditional private equity playbook by putting up far more of his own money than is usual in such a deal, about three quarters of the price. But he’s also following more standard practice for what Wall Street calls a leveraged buyout, borrowing $13 billion that would be transferred onto Twitter’s books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In other words, his plan for Twitter includes both more cash than the typical buyout and more debt than Twitter may be able to handle, given its patchy profitability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The structure of the deal means Mr. Musk’s push for unfettered “free speech” on Twitter could find itself in conflict with the company’s basic need to pay off its new debt. If less restrictive moderation of content on the platform leads to more unfiltered exchanges and misinformation, Twitter’s main source of revenue — advertising — could suffer, since most advertisers are wary of associating their brands with polarizing content. And the company doesn’t yet have other meaningful sources of revenue, although it has experimented with subscriptions. If advertising revenue falls, Twitter, which employs more than 7,000 people, could struggle to make interest payments., The acquisition is also a big financial risk for Mr. Musk, more than usual for private equity-style buyers who often limit their exposure by using mostly borrowed money instead of cash. Because of the way the acquisition is structured, a downturn in Twitter’s fortunes could stretch even Mr. Musk’s considerable financial resources — and challenge his reputation for business savvy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , And because Mr. Musk is both selling Tesla shares and putting them up as collateral for personal loans to raise cash, Tesla’s value would be linked to Twitter’s. Any trouble at Twitter could force Mr. Musk to draw on his stock in the electric carmaker he runs to plug potential holes. And any problem at Tesla that caused its stock to fall far enough could trigger clauses in Mr. Musk’s personal loans that would require him to add more collateral, limiting his ability to invest in Twitter.                                                                                                                                                                                    , “I don’t care about the economics at all,” Mr. Musk said at a TED conference a day after making his buyout offer. The businessman, whose career is marked by upending industry norms, said that the deal is “not a way to make money.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Mr. Musk has not explained what kind of owner he will be: a benevolent steward or a private equity-style overlord intent on cutting costs. Bloomberg News reported that Mr. Musk had pitched a business plan for Twitter that included layoffs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Perhaps Mr. Musk is approaching this acquisition the way other billionaires have approached their media purchases: not to turn a profit, but to secure an entity’s future. But the size of Mr. Musk’s bet, and the debt involved in financing it, puts the Twitter deal in a different league from, say, the $250 million purchase of The Washington Post in 2013 by Jeff Bezos, or Marc Benioff’s 2018 takeover of Time magazine for $190 million, both of which were fully paid for in cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Musk will ultimately be judged on whether he can make the numbers add up. Will his unusual financing plan secure Twitter’s future and prove critics wrong or seal its fate and squander a big chunk of his fortune?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Musk has offered $54.20 a share for the roughly 90 percent of Twitter he doesn’t already own. To pay for this, he has lined up $46.5 billion. Of that amount, $21 billion is in cash, some of which comes from selling Tesla shares. This past week, Mr. Musk sold more than $8 billion in Tesla stock, according to securities filings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Another $12.5 billion is from what’s called a margin loan: money personally borrowed by Mr. Musk from a dozen banks with his Tesla shares pledged as collateral, carrying an interest rate of around 4 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The remaining $13 billion is in the form of loans from a group of seven banks that will become Twitter’s responsibility to repay. The banks are charging relatively high interest rates on these loans, from around 5 percent to more than 10 percent in some cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Twitter’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA — a key measure of its capacity to service its debt — is roughly $1 billion a year. The typical leveraged buyout puts debt worth six times a company’s EBITDA on its balance sheet, according to LCD, a data service. The debt in Mr. Musk’s proposal is twice as high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “It’s rare for a company that is not generating as much cash, or is generating only moderate amounts of cash, to have this amount of debt because you’ll starve the company of the ability to continue to hire engineers and seek out growth opportunities,” said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University. But, he noted, “Elon would have the ability to fund the company with his own cash.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Traditional private equity buyers use very little of their own cash. Instead, they borrow most of the money to pay for an acquisition. In the first quarter of this year, only 44 percent of the average value of all buyouts was paid in cash, according to LCD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , A blockbuster deal. Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, capped what seemed an improbable attempt by the famously mercurial billionaire to buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion. Here’s how the deal unfolded:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The initial offer. Mr. Musk made an unsolicited bid worth more than $40 billion for the influential social network, saying that he wanted to make Twitter a private company and that he wanted people to be able to speak more freely on the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The response. Twitter’s board countered Mr. Musk’s offer with a defense mechanism known as a “poison pill.” This well-worn corporate tactic makes a company less palatable to a potential acquirer by making it more expensive for them to buy shares above a certain threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Securing financing. Though his original offer had scant details and was received skeptically by Wall Street, Mr. Musk moved swiftly to secure commitments worth $46.5 billion to finance his bid, putting pressure on Twitter’s board to take his advances seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Striking a deal. With the financing in place, Twitter’s board met with Mr. Musk to discuss his offer. The two sides soon reached a deal, with the social media company agreeing to sell itself for $54.20 a share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , What’s next? Shareholders will vote on the offer, which will also be reviewed by regulators. The deal is expected to take three to six months to close. In the meantime, scrutiny is likely to be intense and several questions remain about Mr. Musk’s plans for the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , This structure is risky because a company can buckle under a heavy debt load. It is also potentially lucrative because the use of borrowed money — “leverage” in industry terms — can increase the financial returns if the buyers eventually take the company public again or sell it to a new buyer at a higher price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The greed and glory of private equity players was set out in gripping detail in the 1989 book “Barbarians at the Gate,” about the $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco by KKR and its subsequent fall. It cemented them in the popular imagination as among capitalism’s more rapacious actors, buying companies, piling debt on them, stripping costs, cutting benefits and laying off workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The takeover of TXU turned out to be a disaster, because a downturn in natural gas prices hammered its business as it groaned under the weight of its debts. Toys “R” Us went bankrupt in 2017, after the mountain of debt it took on when it went private in 2005 left it without the resources to compete against the rise of Amazon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Musk first set out to raise debt financing for his bid by calling banks and other financial institutions starting the Saturday of Easter weekend. Bankers drew comfort, in part, from the fact that the deal would be backstopped by the world’s wealthiest man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Still, the interest rates on the loans reflect the risk that they might not get paid back. The banks don’t hold on to the loans but sell them to other investors in the market, so if Twitter can’t pay its debts, Mr. Musk will either have to pay those investors, perhaps by selling more Tesla stock, or he could cede some part of his ownership of Twitter, diluting his stake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Tesla had a market value of $902 billion as of Friday, but its shares have fallen by nearly 20 percent since Mr. Musk first revealed, in early April, that he had bought a big stake in Twitter. If Twitter’s finances go south, forcing Mr. Musk to sell more Tesla stock to pay Twitter’s debts or pledge more shares as collateral for his personal loans, it could put further pressure on Tesla’s stock price. Mr. Musk doesn’t take a salary from Tesla but is paid in stock that is released based on performance milestones that include the company’s share price.                                                                                                                    , Since Mr. Musk first disclosed his stake, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index has fallen more than 10 percent, making his offer appear even more generous. “It’s a high price and your shareholders will love it,” Mr. Musk said in a letter to Twitter’s board. Although the social media company’s stock had traded higher than Mr. Musk’s offer just six months ago, it slumped far below that price early this year and looked unlikely to return to those highs any time soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Musk has considered teaming up with investment firms in his bid to buy Twitter, which would reduce the amount of money he would personally have to invest. He could still partner with a firm or other investors like family offices to help raise cash, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Thoma Bravo, a technology-focused buyout firm, has expressed willingness to provide some financing, but nothing has been decided yet. Apollo, an alternative asset manager, also looked at a possible deal where it would extend a loan on preferred terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , If the deal math becomes unpalatable for Mr. Musk, he has an out: a breakup fee of $1 billion. For a man with an estimated fortune well over $200 billion, that’s a small price to pay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Advertisement </td>

And dissident shareholder proposals failed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Send any friend a story                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month.

Buffett, reported on Saturday a significant drop in earnings in the first quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Profits at the company, which owns a diverse array of American brands from the car insurer Geico to the ice cream chain Dairy Queen, fell to $5.4 billion. That was down 53 percent from the nearly $12 billion that it earned in the same three months a year ago. Those profits were also lower than the $6 billion that analysts had expected the company would earn in the quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Much of the drop, though, was driven by Berkshire’s large stock portfolio, which lost nearly $1.6 billion in the first three months of the year, down from a gain of nearly $5 billion in the first quarter of 2021. That drop mirrored the performance of the stock market in general, which had its worst month in two years in April, and has been dragged down by investors’ fears about rising inflation and uncertainty caused by the Ukrainian war and the pandemic’s lingering impact on global supply chains.                                                                                                                                                            , The earnings report came out as the company was holding its annual meeting in person for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic. Mr. Buffett said on Saturday at the meeting that Berkshire had been buying shares of the video game company Activision Blizzard since Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision on Jan. 18 and now holds a 9.5 percent stake in the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The company’s financial filings also showed that Berkshire had dramatically increased its investment in the oil company giant Chevron to nearly $26 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from just $4.5 billion at the end of 2021. That made Chevron Berkshire’s forth largest holding, behind Apple, Bank of America and American Express. Mr. Buffett has recently been making big bets on the energy sector. Last month, the company also bought $7 billion in shares of Occidental Petroleum.                                                                                                                                                                         , Sales and profits at Berkshire’s operating businesses continued to rise in the quarter, bucking the overall contraction in the U.S. economy in the first quarter. Economists said, though, that the drop in gross domestic product hid some underlying strength in the U.S. economy, and Berkshire’s operating results seemed to back that up. Profits at Berkshire's manufacturing and retail businesses rose 16 percent from the same period a year ago. Profits at its railroad company Burlington Northern, one of the largest freight networks in the United States, were up 9 percent, again reflecting continued business activity.                                        , Berkshire’s mixed first-quarter results came as tens of thousands of Mr. Buffett’s loyal investors flocked to Omaha, his hometown, for the company’s annual meeting. The Buffett-fest is a daylong folksy affair, often called “Woodstock for Capitalists,” in which Mr. Buffett spends hours answering questions in front of a crowd in the city’s downtown 17,000-seat arena. While there were some empty seats, several corporate notables were there, among them Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, as well as Bill Ackman, the head of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, and the actor Bill Murray., A giant conference room floor was filled with booths highlighting Berkshire’s many companies, and offering discounts on things like boxes of See’s Candies, also owned by Berkshire. Mr. Buffett said on Saturday from the stage that See’s had brought 11 tons of candy to the shareholder meeting, and expected to sell out. Only shareholders can attend in person. The meeting has been virtual for the past two years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr. Buffett, in fielding shareholder questions at the meeting, was critical of Wall Street. He said the stock market resembled “a gambling parlor” in recent years, adding that the speculative behavior was “encouraged by Wall Street.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Mr. Buffett, 91, faces a slightly more contentious annual meeting than usual, despite the fact that Berkshire’s shares, up nearly 8 percent this year, have outperformed the overall market, which is down 13 percent. “Historically, Berkshire shares have outperformed during periods of economic distress as investors made a ‘flight to quality,’” Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who follows Berkshire, wrote in a note to clients this past week.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Dissident shareholders put up a proposal asking Berkshire to overhaul how it views and details its climate risk, something Mr. Buffett has resisted doing. They say Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which manages a number of large utilities, has lagged rivals in setting plans to lower its emissions of carbon dioxide. The climate proposal last year had the support of many larger shareholders outside of Mr. Buffett’s inner circle, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.                                                                                                                                                                                          , What’s more, a number of large investors, including the giant California Public Employees Retirement Fund, backed a shareholder proposal that sought to remove Mr. Buffett, who is currently both chief executive and chairman of the company’s board of directors, from his chair role. That proposal is one that larger investors have floated at other companies as well, arguing that splitting the roles is better corporate governance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Buffett opposed the proposals and they failed on Saturday. Because he has a large number of votes, proposals Mr. Buffett opposes are typically defeated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , When responding to the climate proposal on Saturday, he once again emphasized that Berkshire Hathaway Energy was making big investments in renewable energy projects. But those behind the proposal said they wanted Berkshire to make climate disclosures for the whole company, not just parts of the conglomerate. “What we are asking for is a composite picture,” said Timothy Youmans, an executive at EOS at Federated Hermes in North America, which was a sponsor of the climate proposal.                                                                                                                                                                               , Peter Eavis contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Berkshire Hathaway added to its Chevron bet significantly during the first quarter, making the energy stock the conglomerate's fourth biggest equity holding.                                                                                             , The "Oracle of Omaha's" Chevron investment was worth $25.9 billion at the end of March, the company's first-quarter filing Saturday showed, a big jump from its value of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.                                                 , Shares of Chevron have rallied more than 30% this year on the back of surging oil prices, but Berkshire's position has increased fivefold reflecting Buffett's buying.                                                                                    , Energy has been a standout winner this year with the S&amp;P 500 energy sector up 35% compared to the broader benchmark's 13% loss year to date.                                                                                                              , Many oil and gas companies are also good income generators, offering attractive dividends. The energy sector yields 4.7%, compared to S&amp;P 500′s 1.5% dividend yield. Chevron pays a 3.6% dividend.                                                        , Chevron is not the only energy stock Buffett likes. Last month, the investor bought $7 billion worth of Occidental Petroleum's common shares in additional investments.                                                                                   , "Together with the $10 billion in OXY preferred, Berkshire's bet on the oil sector is now over $40 billion," said James Shanahan, a Berkshire analyst at Edward Jones.                                                                                    , Berkshire's biggest holding was still Apple, worth $159 billion at the end of the first quarter. Bank of America and American Express were the two other big holdings, worth $42.6 billion and $28.4 billion, respectively.                               , The significant Chevron bet might indicate that Berkshire will not acquire Occidental despite the recent jump in the ownership.                                                                                                                           , "It says that energy is the most attractive place in the market to Warren and that he won't take OXY private," said Cole Smead, president and a portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.                                                            , Buffett first bought Chevron in the third quarter of 2020. Based on the stock price moves in April, Chevron may have moved into the third biggest position above American Express depending on whether Buffett bought or sold any shares during the month., Check out all of the CNBC Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting coverage here.                                                                                                                                                                                , Got a confidential news tip?

To be sure, Buffett always advises shareholders to ignore these quarterly investment fluctuations.                                                                                                                                                                          , "The amount of investment gains (losses) in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net earnings per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of accounting rules," Berkshire said in Saturday's release.                                                                                                                     , Berkshire's stock buybacks also slowed down to $3.2 billion from $6.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, as the company was more active with dealmaking last quarter than it had been for a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                         , In late March, the company said it agreed to buy insurer Alleghany for $11.6 billion — marking Buffett's biggest deal since 2016. Berkshire also unveiled a stake in oil giant Occidental Petroleum that's now worth more than $7 billion, along with a position in HP Inc that' now valued at more than $4.5 billion.                                                                             , Despite the tough environment, Berkshire as an investment has been stellar this year. The conglomerate's Class A stock is up more than 7% for the year — outperforming the S&amp;P 500, which is down 13.3% for 2022. While down from the fourth quarter, the company still showed a massive cash hoard of $106.3 billion as of the end of the first quarter.                                          , The company's latest quarterly figures come as thousands flocked to Omaha, Nebraska for Berkshire's annual meeting, where Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will take questions from shareholders.

Mr. Musk’s deal requires him to get approval for his social media posts about Tesla — the charges were related to tweets he posted saying that he had secured financing to take Tesla private — and bans him from discussing the case., The S.E.C.’s gag order has been around since 1972. The practice, which allows settling defendants to neither admit nor deny wrongdoings on the condition that they never speak about the case in public, is meant to help the S.E.C. police the markets more efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The rationale is that if every defendant opted out of a trial but then later reframed the charges to the public, it would undermine the validity of resolutions and the legitimacy of Wall Street’s chief regulators, experts say. “It makes everything look like a sham,” said Harvey Pitt, a former agency chairman, who has little sympathy for retractors. “It’s unseemly for somebody who doesn’t admit to then violate a gag order. They have an out — refuse to settle.”                           , Denials after settlement also suggest that nothing actually happened, potentially downplaying the risks surrounding an individual or entity to investors. For defendants, remaining silent about a case can be an invaluable protection. That’s a choice defendants can make, said Alma Angotti, a former enforcement lawyer at the S.E.C. and the Treasury Department: “It’s a voluntary waiver.”                                                                                                        , But the executives in the amicus brief argue that the choice isn’t actually a choice. They say most cases end up settling because fighting the S.E.C. is too costly. Mr. Musk has said he settled because litigation would have put Tesla under too much financial pressure and jeopardized its financing.                                                                                                                                                                                                , And banning any discussions about the cases, the brief argues, actually goes against the S.E.C.’s mission to protect investors, leaving them in the dark instead about material information. The executives go on to cite the former S.E.C. chairman Arthur Levitt, who said in a 1999 speech that “quality information is the lifeblood of strong, vibrant markets.” The group argues that the S.E.C. should be “barred from discouraging full, frank, public discussion,” which ensures this vibrancy.  , Mr. Musk calls himself a “free speech absolutist” and says he believes in the unfettered flow of information within the law, as the amicus brief he joined argues to the Supreme Court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Of course, the justices might not take up the case. But with Mr. Musk making headlines denouncing the gag order policy, the issue is getting a lot of attention and the New York court that just denied Mr. Musk’s claims did rely on the ruling in Mr. Romeril’s case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Whether his defenders would succeed in invalidating the S.E.C. provision — even if the Supreme Court agrees to review the matter — is very much up in the air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A blockbuster deal. Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, capped what seemed an improbable attempt by the famously mercurial billionaire to buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion. Here’s how the deal unfolded:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The initial offer. Mr. Musk made an unsolicited bid worth more than $40 billion for the influential social network, saying that he wanted to make Twitter a private company and that he wanted people to be able to speak more freely on the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The response. Twitter’s board countered Mr. Musk’s offer with a defense mechanism known as a “poison pill.” This well-worn corporate tactic makes a company less palatable to a potential acquirer by making it more expensive for them to buy shares above a certain threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Securing financing. Though his original offer had scant details and was received skeptically by Wall Street, Mr. Musk moved swiftly to secure commitments worth $46.5 billion to finance his bid, putting pressure on Twitter’s board to take his advances seriously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Striking a deal. With the financing in place, Twitter’s board met with Mr. Musk to discuss his offer. The two sides soon reached a deal, with the social media company agreeing to sell itself for $54.20 a share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , What’s next? Shareholders will vote on the offer, which will also be reviewed by regulators. The deal is expected to take three to six months to close. In the meantime, scrutiny is likely to be intense and several questions remain about Mr. Musk’s plans for the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Throughout the justice system, defendants commonly waive rights in exchange for the many financial and reputational benefits of a swift resolution, Ms. Angotti said. In contrast, “when you lose a trial, you bear the brunt of a finding.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , But vague resolutions can be problematic in this age, according to Gurbir Grewal, the director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “When it comes to accountability, few things rival the magnitude of wrongdoers admitting that they broke the law,” Mr. Grewal said in a speech in October. “And so, in an era of diminished trust, we will, in appropriate circumstances, be requiring admissions in cases where heightened accountability and acceptance of responsibility are in the public interest.”                                                                                                                                  , This could be a “significant” change, some lawyers say, but the S.E.C. in 2013 made a similar pledge, which proved less than revolutionary. Three years after that announcement, the agency obtained admissions from less than 2 percent of the individuals and entities charged, researchers found.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Since Mr. Grewal’s speech, the agency has announced 10 settlements, one of which was reached before the policy shift. Of the remaining nine, there have been two admissions of guilt. The S.E.C. did not respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Though the S.E.C. can justify its gag orders, it doesn’t systematically enforce them, writes Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law School professor. That failure only supports critics’ arguments for more oversight of the agency, he said. And there is a danger that it can use the vow of silence to shield itself from valid critique anyway — because most people do not have the financial wherewithal that Mr. Musk has and can’t afford to risk another tussle with the government.                       , Mr. Musk recently aired his grievances at a TED conference interview while his request to vacate his own settlement was under consideration. And he trolled the S.E.C. on Twitter on the day of the announcement of his deal to acquire the platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Of course, Mr. Musk will not be easily silenced, and his potential acquisition of Twitter won’t make him more circumspect, whatever a judge says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , What do you think?

It also said Mr. Kotick owns 4.3 million shares and has the right to acquire another 2.2 million -- potentially worth just over $500 million combined at the $95-a-share deal price. Mr. Kotick received $826,549 in compensation in 2021, according to the filing.                                          , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Friday's disclosure, in Activision's annual proxy statement, reflects the company's definitive accounting for Mr. Kotick's stake in the company and potential severance under existing agreements.

To save money and afford the help she needs to wash her hair and clean, Ms. Hart, 77, is cutting back on taxi rides to visit her son several towns away, and keeping the heat off, even if it aggravates her pain.                                                                                           , “You really don’t think you will be one of those that cannot afford to heat yourself,” Ms. Hart said. “There must be thousands more people who are like me thinking: What went wrong?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Inflation was already on the rise in Britain and elsewhere before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, triggered by rising natural gas prices and supply-chain shortages after pandemic lockdowns. The war has abruptly pushed the price of oil and gas even higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Now consumer prices in Britain are rising at their fastest rate in 30 years, and wages are failing to keep up, putting a squeeze on household incomes not seen since records began in 1956.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The cost-of-living jump is especially dismaying for older people and others with lower or limited incomes, such as those living on government pensions and disability payments, which remained largely the same even as inflation hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , April has been especially tough. Earlier in the month the government raised its cap on energy prices, which follow the global gas prices, by 54 percent, a move that affects 22 million households. The cap, which is reset twice a year, is expected to rise again in October, ahead of the icy winter months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The continuing war in Ukraine not only promises to keep energy bills high for the foreseeable future, it is also pushing up the price of food, because Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of wheat, corn, barley and cooking oil. Overall inflation in Britain is expected to hit a peak of 9 percent later this year. According to figures released by the government on Friday, over 90 percent of adults said their cost of living had increased over a two-week period in April, largely because of food and energy bills., Demonstrators in the thousands took to the streets in cities across the country last month to protest the soaring cost of living. Help lines for older people are reporting an increasing number of calls asking about assistance with energy bills in recent weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , And many people who had already culled their household budgets are going through them once more, forgoing meals and in the most extreme cases being disconnected from the electricity and gas for periods, according to some advocacy organizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Even before the latest escalations, households were feeling the strain, with over three million people in England alone facing “fuel poverty,” or struggling to afford to heat one’s home, in 2020, according to government figures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In April, almost half of adults paying energy bills said they had struggled to afford those charges, and one in five was unable to buy fuel at some point, according to Britain’s Office for National Statistics. Nearly a quarter of adults in Britain said it was very difficult to pay their households bills in March compared with a year earlier.                                                                                                                                                                           , Opposition lawmakers pressed the government on Wednesday on its plan to tackle high inflation and the economic slowdown in the country, accusing Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ignoring the problem. Mr. Johnson pointed to a raft of measures to help offset the energy cap increase, including some tax rebates, and a falling unemployment rate.                                                                                                                                                                             , Britain has experienced soaring energy prices before, but the current situation is “once in a generation,” said Jack Leslie, a senior economist with the Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank focused on improving living standards for those with lower incomes. He added that there was no indication that energy prices would subside imminently. “This is on another level,” he said.                                                                                                                             , Ms. Hart, who rents her book-filled bungalow, moved to Clacton-on-Sea for the sun and the outdoors, she said. With her difficulty walking long distances nowadays, her social life consists of going to the beachfront and visits from a helper who comes several times a week to assist with washing her hair for about 75 British pounds a month. And with news that her rent has also risen 20 pounds a month, she is even thinking of losing the helper.                                                                      , Britain is feeling the squeeze from rising inflation and high fuel prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , I went to the town of Clacton-on-Sea and met many older people who live on fixed incomes and are struggling with mounting bills. Here’s what I saw →                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In a bungalow not far from the sea, I met Maureen Hart, 77, a former librarian. In April, her gas and electricity bill tripled to 170 pounds from about 50 pounds. Her other bills are also creeping up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Now she keeps the heating off, uses the oven as little as possible and visits her son once a month, instead of twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “What else do I cut back?” she said. “You get to a certain age and you’re brushed under the carpet.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , At a weekly lunch club, where people can get a cheap home-cooked meal, there were both dismay and resignation about the rising cost of living. “People are worried,” said Jean Williams, a volunteer serving the lunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Jennifer Belcher, 67, center right, is helping her friend Patricia Hutton, 89, left, save on food by buying it at reduced prices just before it expires. “We take her under our wings,” Belcher said. “We are good bargain shoppers.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Advocates say that for vulnerable people, inadequate heating can worsen health conditions. Many fear the rising cost will lead to some being disconnected from electricity or gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Help lines are advising people to seek government financial relief where possible. “They’re nowhere near enough for the level of need,” said Martin Lord, director of Citizens Advice Essex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “People can guess what will happen in the winter. It’s going to be horrible.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Read more about the crisis that many Britons face because of inflation and soaring energy costs:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “All my family and friends say the same thing — what are we supposed to cut back?” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , She is looking into whether she can take advantage of some measures that the government instituted last month to help people with rising costs, including a £500 million grant for local authorities to distribute to lower-income households.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But critics and campaigners have said the measures do not match the severity of the rising prices, repeating a longtime plea for benefits to be raised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Previously the expectation was that older people would be able to tighten their belts,” said David Southgate, a policy and research officer at Age U.K., a group supporting older people. “The difficulty now is that there are no more cuts older people can make to their household budgets.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion.  Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade.

But since her energy bill doubled in April, Ms. Williams has begun cutting down her weekly shopping list to essentials, microwaving meals instead of using the oven and canceling TV streaming services. What has remained essentially the same this year is her disability payment, she said.                                                                , “I can’t just switch the heating on, because I can’t afford to,” she said, adding that it had left her more nauseated and in pain. “It’s been tough.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , To help one another through fears of a cost-of-living crisis, many older people — ranging from anxious to resigned — are banding together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , On a recent sunny afternoon, dozens of people gathered for a lunch in Jaywick, near Clacton-on-Sea, where residents paid £1.50 (about $2) as volunteers served them tea, coffee and a two-course meal. Some people declined to discuss their finances, citing the event as an escape from a source of stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , It was the social highlight of the week for Patricia Hutton, 89, a Jaywick resident, who said events like this kept her going through times of crisis. Like everybody’s, her bills have gone up, but with her arthritis and some mobility issues it was hard to keep the heat and lights off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “I pay all my bills by direct debit, and if there’s no money left for food there’s no money left for food,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Her friend Jennifer Belcher, 67, has begun going out early in the morning and buying food discounted because it was set to expire soon in order to help Ms. Hutton reduce her grocery expenditure. “We’ve saved her nearly £40 a month on her shopping,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ms. Belcher’s own energy bill more than doubled last month, she said.

But like the panic-buying that stripped grocery store shelves at various moments of the pandemic, the current wave of protectionism will only compound the problems that governments are trying to mitigate, trade experts warn.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Export restrictions are making grains, oils, meat and fertilizer — already at record prices — more expensive and even harder to come by. That is placing an even greater burden on the world’s poor, who are paying an ever-larger share of their income for food, increasing the risk of social unrest in poorer countries struggling with food insecurity.                                                                                                                  , Since the beginning of the year, countries have imposed a total of 47 export curbs on food and fertilizers — with 43 of those put in place since the invasion of Ukraine in late February, according to tracking by Simon Evenett, a professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallen.                                                                                                                                               , “Before the invasion, there’s a very small number of attempts to try and restrict exports of food and fertilizers,” Mr. Evenett said. “After the invasion you see a huge uptick.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The cascade of new trade barriers comes as the war in Ukraine, and the sanctions imposed by the West on Russia, are further straining supply chains that were already in disarray from the pandemic. Russia is the world’s largest exporter of wheat, pig iron, nickel and natural gas, and a major supplier of coal, crude oil and fertilizer. Ukraine is the world’s largest exporter of sunflower seed oil and a significant exporter of wheat, pig iron, maize and barley., With countries facing severe threats to supplies of basic goods, many policymakers have quickly dropped the language of open markets and begun advocating a more protective approach. Recommendations range from creating secure supply chains for certain critical materials in friendly countries to blocking exports and “reshoring” foreign factories, bringing operations back to their home countries.                                                                  , In a speech last week, Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, said the pandemic and the war had revealed that American supply chains, while efficient, were neither secure nor resilient. While cautioning against “a fully protectionist direction,” she said the United States should work to reorient its trade relationships toward a large group of “trusted partners,” even if it meant somewhat higher costs for businesses and consumers.                           , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director general of the World Trade Organization, said in a speech on Wednesday that the war had “justifiably” added to questions about economic interdependence. But she urged countries not to draw the wrong conclusions about the global trading system, saying it had helped drive global growth and provided countries with important goods even during the pandemic.                                                                          , “While it is true that global supply chains can be prone to disruptions, trade is also a source of resilience,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The W.T.O. has argued against export bans since the early days of the pandemic, when countries including the United States began throwing up restrictions on exporting masks and medical goods and removed them only gradually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Now, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a similar wave of bans focused on food. “It’s like déjà vu all over again,” Mr. Evenett said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Protectionist measures have cascaded from country to country in a manner that is particularly evident when it comes to wheat. Russia and Ukraine export more than a quarter of the world’s wheat, feeding billions of people in the form of bread, pasta and packaged foods.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Mr. Evenett said the current wave of trade barriers on wheat had begun as the war’s protagonists, Russia and Belarus, clamped down on exports. The countries that lie along a major trading route for Ukrainian wheat, including Moldova, Serbia and Hungary, then began restricting their wheat exports. Finally, major importers with food security concerns, like Lebanon, Algeria and Egypt, put their own bans into effect.                                              , Mr. Evenett said the dynamic was “still unfolding” and likely to get worse in the months to come. Ukraine’s summer growing season for wheat is being disrupted as fighting keeps farmers away from their fields and pulls workers off to war. And grocery stores in Spain, Greece and Britain are already introducing restrictions on the amount of cereals or oil people can buy.                                                                                            , “We’re already feeling the pinch in Europe of limited supplies of these key crops,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Several other consequential export bans on food are unrelated to the war, but they will still play into the global dynamic of rising prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , China began ordering its firms to stop selling fertilizer to other countries last summer, in order to preserve supplies at home, Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Yilin Wang, a research analyst at the institute, wrote in a recent blog post. Now that Russia has also cut off exports of fertilizer, China’s ban will be even more harmful.                                                                           , “China’s decision to take fertilizer supplies off world markets to ensure its own food security only pushes the problem onto others,” they wrote, adding that “China’s ongoing export restrictions could hardly come at a worse time.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Indonesia’s restrictions on palm oil, a key ingredient in packaged foods, detergent and cosmetics, are in line with similar bans the country placed on exporting the product before the war in an attempt to keep the price of oil affordable for Indonesian households.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Those measures will add to skyrocketing prices for vegetable oils, driven by a disruption in the supply from Ukraine, the world’s largest producer of sunflower oil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Governments that put these restrictions in place often argue that their duty is to put the needs of their own citizens first, and the W.T.O.’s rules allow countries to impose temporary measures for national security or safety. But the measures can easily backfire, helping to push up global prices further.                                                                                                                                                            , Price increases for food have been felt particularly keenly in poorer countries in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, which depend on imported food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion.  Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                                 , Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.                                                                                                                                                                          , In a blog post on Thursday, Abebe Aemro Selassie, the director of the International Monetary Fund’s African Department, and Peter Kovacs, an economist in the department, wrote that sub-Saharan Africa was facing a severe shock from rising food and fuel prices that would slow economic growth, sink governments into debt and erode standards of living.                                                                                                                 , Food accounts for about 40 percent of consumer spending in sub-Saharan Africa, they said, and around 85 percent of the region’s wheat supplies are imported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , International organizations have pledged to increase their support for emergency food supplies and other aid, but the scale of the problem is daunting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Dr. Okonjo-Iweala said she was urging the trade group’s members to refrain from restricting exports and to share any buffer stocks of food, to try to keep prices from soaring. She said that fewer than 10 percent of W.T.O. members had imposed export restrictions and that she had made clear to members that such bans would only compound current problems.                                                                                                             , “I’m very concerned about the pending food crisis and steps we need to take,” she told a group of journalists in Washington on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Dr. Okonjo-Iweala, who recently visited Brazil, a major agricultural exporter, said President Jair Bolsonaro had expressed concerns about Brazil’s ability to obtain fertilizer, which typically comes from the Black Sea region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , She said she had pressed Mr. Bolsonaro about whether Brazil had additional vegetable oil or grains that it could offer on global markets. Mr. Bolsonaro told her that the country’s crops were already under contract, but said Brazil would try to produce more next season, she said.                                                                                                                                                                                       , A prolonged war, or the addition of new sanctions, could cause prices to rise further. But even absent those trends, the factors that have pushed up prices may be hard to unwind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In a report on Tuesday, the World Bank said the war in Ukraine had altered trade patterns in ways that would keep commodity prices higher through the end of 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Countries have begun seeking out other sources of certain goods — for example, purchasing more costly coal from farther-flung nations like Colombia and the United States — to avoid buying from Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , And many of the price increases are interrelated. Higher energy costs are increasing the price of fertilizer, which is produced with natural gas. That in turn is pushing up agricultural prices as crops become more expensive to plant. Rising prices for wheat are also pushing up the price of rice, as people seek out alternatives.                                                                                                                                     , The World Bank estimated that prices of non-energy goods, like agricultural products and metals, would increase almost 20 percent this year before moderating in following years, while wheat prices are expected to rise more than 40 percent to reach a high this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lviv, Ukraine — At the train station in Lviv, on the westernmost edge of Ukraine, women are at a physical and psychological crossroads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , After arriving in the city, now a waypoint for displaced people, humanitarian aid and weapons, they've had to ask themselves a set of daunting questions. Where should we go next? Will my children be safe there? How long will we stay?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , In the back of their minds is a gnawing fear: Will we even have a home to return to?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , If there's one thing to know about the dilemma they face, it's that many are having to make snap decisions about their family's future alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Military conscription rules in Ukraine mean that men between the ages of 18 and 60 are blocked from leaving the country. And, in any case, many have chosen to sign up and join the fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , So while millions of Ukrainians have fled Russia's invasion since it was launched by President Vladimir Putin more than two months ago, almost all of those who have crossed the border are women and children. They make up a staggering 90% of Ukraine's refugees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mothers have largely borne the brunt of the migration crisis, picking up the pieces after their families were torn apart, caring for children and elderly parents. CNN spoke with several who had uprooted their lives in the wake of the war and were weighing whether it was time to take their families back to Ukraine. One woman, Liudmyla Sobchenko, a 28-year-old from the Zhytomyr region northwest of Kyiv, spent three weeks in Poland with her young son and mother before deciding it was time to come home. "I won't say it's bad there in Poland ... But it's not our land," she said., Since late March, when CNN visited the station in Lviv, the flow of Ukrainians back to the country has continued to increase and is now about 30,000 a day, according to Andrii Demchenko, a press officer for the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. "We have no right to ask the purpose of the trip, but many women shared that they no longer want to stay abroad," he told CNN on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Some of the most heart-wrenching, early images of the war were from railway stations across Ukraine. Crowds clambered into carriages, babies held aloft. Couples embraced in passionate, desperate goodbyes. Little hands and faces pressed against foggy windows as fathers stood alone, sobbing on platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Many passed through Lviv station before traveling on to neighboring Poland, or further afield. Hour after hour, a wave of women and children would disembark. The names of the cities and towns they left — Sumy, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson — created a constellation of suffering that criss-crossed Ukraine, reflecting in real time where fighting had flared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , They carried with them few belongings, but burdensome stories. They said that after days or weeks hiding out in basements and bunkers, the relentless shelling, sirens and sleepless nights became too much. Their children echoed the sounds of the bombs that forced them to evacuate: "Ba-bah-ka, ba-bah-ka! Boom, boom!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Weeks after the initial exodus, the grand Art Nouveau train station in Lviv, two miles from the city's old town, was still busy with families on the move. But not all were heading west. Some, like Sobchenko, were beginning to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , There are still more people fleeing violence in the country than returning. But, according to officials and those displaced by the war, the increasing number reflects a gradual acceptance that the fighting could drag on for some time. With that in mind, many Ukrainians have decided they would rather return and risk living in a conflict zone than be a refugee in another country, without any family or support network.                                                                                                                                                                 , That shifting attitude also reflects the challenges for European governments attempting to cope with the largest refugee crisis on the continent since World War II.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In a room for women and children above the fray of the main terminal, families were regrouping. Some rested on thin mattresses, staring blankly at the painted, vaulted ceiling overhead. Others scrolled on smartphones, reading the latest news from the front lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Sobchenko fled the city of Korosten with her 3-year-old son Nazar and 57-year-old mother Tetiana in early March. Explosions edged closer and closer to their home. Then one night a blast blew out the windows in Nazar's room and Sobchenko knew it was time to go. They left their dog and cat behind, fleeing with little besides the clothes on their backs and a bag of essentials — medicine, documents, a change of clothes. A bus ride to the Polish border, a journey that normally takes four hours, dragged on for 24.                                                                   , They were hosted with other refugees in Nowy Targ, a town south of Krakow, near the Slovakian border, but they couldn't settle in. Nazar would shake at night, screaming: "Mama, boom! Boom!" After her mother suffered a nervous breakdown, having to be taken by ambulance to the hospital, Sobchenko decided that despite the dangers, it was better to go back. "I haven't slept for a day. I had some anxiety, and joy when thinking about home," she said.                                                                                                                                    , As the young mother flicked through train time tables and Telegram, Nazar, dressed in a blue and orange striped hoodie, sat in a nearby play space with other children, sifting through stuffed animals, blocks and books. Sobchenko called him over to give him a cookie and a hug. "I don't speak with him about war. I just tell him that now it's safe, there's not going to be any 'boom' any more. What can a mother do?" she asked.                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Julia Kovalska, a 27-year-old volunteer who organizes games and other activities for children passing through the station, said it's been chilling to see how they speak about the horrors they've witnessed. "Children always remain children, both before and after the war. But their eyes are completely different. They talk about missiles, about bombs so calmly. I can even cry because of it. Mothers cry, grandmothers cry, and children just talk about this experience as it is," she said.                                                                                             , The war has displaced nearly two-thirds of Ukraine's 7.5 million children and killed more than 160, according to UNICEF. Addressing the UN Security Council earlier this month, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told members that "when men like President Putin start wars, women and children get displaced," hurt, raped and abused — and they die. "What is happening to women and children in Ukraine is horrific beyond comprehension," she said.                                                                                                                                       , In a recent survey of Ukrainian refugees in Poland — the majority of them women — the International Rescue Committee found that many had suffered severe traumas since leaving their homes, from family separation, to human trafficking, and physical and sexual violence. Staff working at refugee centers said the toll of the war on children was devastating. Many reported incidents of traumatized minors crying or wetting themselves.                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , In early March, with her baby son in tow, Nadiia Taraatorina, 22, fled her home in Kryvyi Rih, an industrial city in Ukraine's heartland and President Volodymyr Zelensky's hometown, leaving her husband, father and other male relatives behind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Taraatorina and her mother Liubov, 38, set off for the relative safety of western Ukraine, traveling to Lviv station and then on to the Carpathian Mountains in the Zakarpattia region. Weeks later, she was back in Lviv — this time headed home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "We are going home, father is waiting for us. It seems to have become calmer, but who knows what will happen next," Taraatorina said. Her father, a volunteer with Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, told them that the fighting had eased and it was safe for the family to return, but it was unclear how long that peace would hold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , As Taraatorina bottle-fed Artem, wiping milk from his cheeks, her mother asked around about tickets and train times to Dnipro. "The child distracts me from the war. He is at such an age that he does something new every day. But it is difficult to be far away from my husband, it is difficult to be 'na chuzhyni,'" she said, using an emotive phrase in Ukrainian to describe the dislocation of being far from home, in a strange and foreign land.                                                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , It's a feeling expressed by many other women, who say they escaped the war to keep their children safe, but suffered from an unsettling and implacable sense of guilt for having left their "motherland" behind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In the first days of the war, Yana Matiushenkova, 30, and her daughter Arina, 3, crammed into an overcrowded train bound for Lviv from the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine. After days of chaotic travel they finally wound up in Wroclaw, a city in western Poland known for its picturesque old town and market square. But she struggled to adjust to her new surroundings.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Here I was walking with my daughter in Wroclaw ... everything is beautiful around. And in Ukraine there's shelling, people do not sleep at night. This started to stress me out a lot. It's probably guilt. I was told that there is such a thing as 'survivor syndrome,'" Matiushenkova said. Her stress and depression began to affect Arina, who she said became moody and started acting out. Matiushenkova felt they couldn't wait any longer — they would travel back home to Kamyanske.                                                                                                     , "I have no doubts about the correctness of my decision.

"The guilt of the survivor is something that is now common among the majority of Ukrainians. We all see what could happen to us. It will be with us for a while," she said, explaining that she tried to remind mothers they should not feel guilty for surviving and saving their children.                                                                                                                                                               , Deciding to flee was something that Ksenia, 32, wrestled with for a while. The district of Kyiv where she lived with her husband and their two sons, 6-month-old Oleksandr and 3-year-old Andrii, was one of the first to be hit by Russian forces. Ksenia moved them to her mother-in-law's home in a suburb of the capital. Her husband had joined the army, and she wanted to remain nearby.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But when Russian troops advanced and her children kept waking up to bombs, crying out in the night, "Ba-bah!" they packed up their things quickly and fled. "It's very difficult. It's hard to leave your home without really understanding why you have to do it. We went for the children," Ksenia said, rocking Oleksandr in her arms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ksenia's mother-in-law, Valentyna, 58, had been just as determined to stay. She thought that the war would be resolved through diplomacy. Now, she's not so sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "As a mother, it is very difficult for me to leave my son and run away with my grandchildren," she said, her dark eyes welling up as she held Andrii in her lap. "When I think of home, only tears come. Very difficult. We left everything there. We do not want to leave our country! Why should children suffer? Why should our sons suffer?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The two women said they will travel from Lviv to the Netherlands. But as soon as it's safe enough to return, they plan to do so. They have dreams of returning to a peaceful Ukraine, where they'll have a say in their children's future — and their own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Putin will never defeat women, especially Ukrainian women. We Ukrainian women are strong," Valentyna said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Photo editing by Will Lanzoni. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI fell to a 26-month low of 46.0 in April of 2022 from March's reading of 48.1, below market forecasts  of 47.0. The latest figure was also the third contraction in factory activity since the start of the year, as COVID-19 outbreaks took a toll on the economy. Both output and new orders fell at the second steepest pace since the survey began in early 2004, while export orders shrank at the sharpest rate in nearly two years. At the same time, firms significantly cut purchases; employment declined in eight of the last nine months, including April; while  backlogs of work rose further. Delivery times lengthened at second-quickest rate on record, due to travel curbs and raw material shortages. On prices, input cost rose further but the rate of inflation eased; while selling prices rose modestly, on efforts to stay competitive and attract new business. Lastly, sentiment was subdued, amid concerns that the control measures would last too long. </td>

New orders deteriorated further (37.4 vs 45.7 in March) on the back of a faster drop  in both new export orders (42.7 vs 45.8 ) and employment  (45.4 vs 47.1). On prices, input cost rose for the fourth month running despite the rate of increase softening (53.7 vs 55.9); while output prices fell after increasing in March (48.9 vs 51.1). Finally, confidence eased further (53.6 vs 54.6). </td>

Output (44.4 vs 49.5 in March), new orders (42.6 vs 48.8), and new export orders (41.6 vs 47.2) all tumbled while buying levels deteriorated (43.5 vs 48.7) and employment  contracted at a sharper rate (47.2 vs 48.6).  Turning to prices,  input cost remained elevated (64.2 vs 66.1) amid a softer increase in output charges (54.4 vs 56.7). Looking ahead,  business sentiment weakened further (53.3 vs 55.7). </td>

The question is, if I'm an investor, I want to preserve wealth. Secondly, if I want to make money, I want to make it and have a low tax rate because the tax rates [in the] … short term are very high. So what do I do 12 months from now? I think the economy in Europe is going to do better unless Putin does something different. And the economy and China will do better with Xi [Jinping] getting … nominated and run[ning]. So what do I look for is companies that Warren is looking for and that he highlights in his annual report. Companies with cash flow - that is, earnings with regards to interest, taxes and compensation baked in; GAAP - generally accepted accounting principles - and then not the growth companies that are based on multiple revenues. So that's what is changing, Liz. , …                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , [W]e need to have blockchain. That is very important to get stuff bought today and settled today. And that's going to happen on an accelerated basis. But telling me that something is in short supply like Bitcoin because they can't produce anymore - that is a phenomenon that we don't accept because right now - right now, today, you can buy a baseball team called the Atlanta Braves for half the price it will be sold at in two years. And they ain't going to produce any more baseball teams. So why wouldn't you rather own a baseball team than crypto?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Gamco Investors CEO and chairman Mario Gabelli discusses his outlooks for the markets. </td>

Meanwhile, traders gauged upbeat GDP data, with first-quarter preliminary estimates suggesting a 5.6% expansion, which would top most forecasts, including a 3% growth projection by the Bank of Canada.

While rising geopolitical tensions pose headwinds to Taiwan's export-reliant economy, this is unlikely to derail growth in its competitive manufacturing sector. It was Taiwan's second S&amp;P upgrade in a year and the first time since 2001 that it was given an AA+ rating, according to a statement issued by the agency.

It's the closest of those two former communist countries they've been in decades, and they issued a very stridently anti-American communiqué at our time.                    , …                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Former Sen.

It made it pretty clear there are limits… We are finding that China has given lip service to Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. They have not actually said it was an invasion. They didn't vote with the rest of the U.N. Security Council condemning Russia. , WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Former Sen.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wall Street sell-off intensified in the last hour of trading with the Dow closing down 940 points, the S&amp;P 500 sinking 3.6%, and Nasdaq retreating 4.2% as investors digested disappointing results from Amazon and Apple. Amazon sunk more than 14% after reporting a surprise loss because of its investment in Rivian and issuing weak revenue guidance for Q2 2022. Also, Apple declined more than 3% after CFO Luca Maestri stated that supply chain constraints could impede fiscal third-quarter revenue. It has been a difficult month for the stocks with investors digesting the possibility of a 50bps interest rate hike in May from the Fed as the central bank seeks to tame runaway inflation, the war in Ukraine, and a resurgence of COVID in China. On the month, the Nasdaq sunk 13.3%, the most since October 2008; the S&amp;P 500 declined more than 8.8%, the most since March 2020; and the Dow dropped 3.9%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Colombia Hikes Interest Rate to 6% </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The central bank of Colombia raised its benchmark interest rate by another 100bps to 6% in its April 29th meeting, in line with market expectations. The move marked the sixth rate hike since the gradual tightening of conditions began in September 2021, bringing borrowing costs to the highest level since May of 2017. The decision was driven by persistently high price pressures and uncertainty around the international outlook. The annual inflation rate in Colombia accelerated to a six-year high of 8.5% in March, almost triple the 3% target laid out by the central bank. Inflation is expected to fall during the rest of the year and end around 7% in 2022, but is not expected to return to the target within the next two years. Meanwhile, the economy is now seen expanding by 5%, above an earlier estimate of 4.7%. The board meeting is the last before the presidential election in May, with a leftist candidate who has repeatedly criticized the central bank tightening stance, leading the polls. </td>

After a year of explosive, pandemic-driven growth for its grocery delivery business, people were returning to grocery stores. Sales slowed. New customers were harder to find. It could have been the kiss of death for a start-up that expected to grow very fast.                                                                                                                                                                                    , So Apoorva Mehta, Instacart’s co-founder and chief executive, asked Uber and DoorDash, two top competitors, if they were interested in acquiring or partnering with his company, said eight people with knowledge of the talks. Nothing came of the discussions, and in early July Mr. Mehta said he would leave the top job at his company but stay on as chairman.                                                                                                                                                     , The tumultuous summer set the stage for Instacart’s current uncertainty as it tries to avoid becoming another pandemic boom company that has fizzled, like Peloton or Zoom. Mr. Mehta’s replacement, Fidji Simo, a member of Instacart’s board and a former executive at Facebook, now has to lead the company against competition that has become tougher since the pandemic started. She also has to manage skeptical investors who have been waiting at least four years for Instacart to go public.                  , When exactly that will happen became murkier last month when, in a rare move, Instacart said it was slashing its valuation by 40 percent to $24 billion, citing the “market turbulence” that has roiled technology companies. In addition, top executives have left, including two presidents, one of whom resigned after just three months.                                                                                                                                                                             , Instacart faces tougher competition from its gig economy peers, as well as from new instant delivery start-ups like Gopuff and grocery chains’ own online services. Revenue was still growing last year, but not nearly as fast as it did in 2020. Sales growth also slowed sharply, to 15 percent last year from 330 percent in 2020, according to 1010data, a market research firm, while the average size of each order shrank, the company said.                                                                     , In a recent interview, Ms. Simo said she had a plan to tackle those challenges. She has a new vision for the business that includes selling software to grocers and selling more ads inside the app, where people place their orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Ms. Simo attributed the executive departures to people who perhaps didn’t want to stay at a company that no longer felt like a little start-up. Instacart’s growth was still “stupendous,” she added, though the company would not reveal exact numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “Grocery delivery, generally, is a service that people love,” Ms. Simo said. “It adds real value to people’s families, and so I believe that that is very much here to stay.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Instacart, which was founded in 2012, has struggled to show that its business model works and that it is compatible with the historically thin profit margins of the grocery business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The company allows people to order groceries from its partner stores through its app, then dispatches freelance shoppers to gather and deliver them, charging fees to customers and the grocers. It pays its gig workers by the job and treats them as independent contractors — a model that has led to labor fights over worker conditions.                                                                                                                                                                            , In 2020, the San Francisco company found success in the pandemic. Revenue hit $1.5 billion, and while Instacart was not profitable by normal accounting standards, it began generating more cash than it was burning, a person familiar with the company’s finances said. The company said order volume jumped as much as 500 percent. Instacart raked in more than $1 billion in venture funding at a valuation of $39 billion, up from $7.9 billion before the pandemic.                                               , By late spring of 2021, as the country emerged from lockdowns, that momentum had faded. Instacart’s sales in the second quarter of the year fell sharply. Plans to go public that year looked less certain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr. Mehta’s attempt to sell Instacart was a long shot. He approached Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, about a partnership. That fell through because Uber had recently acquired a similar delivery start-up called Cornershop. The companies also talked about the possibility of Uber’s acquiring Instacart, which would have valued Instacart between $35 billion and $42 billion. But that also fell through, said four people familiar with the conversations who were not authorized to discuss them., M. Mehta also called Tony Xu, the chief executive of DoorDash, to ask if the food delivery service would want to acquire Instacart, five people said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Mehta told each company that he was talking to one of its biggest competitors, so it had to act fast. But the discussions did not get far. The other companies had concerns about the price and antitrust scrutiny. Instacart declined to comment on deal talks, which were previously reported by The Information.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Around that time, there were tense discussions between Mr. Mehta and a group of board members led by Michael Moritz, an investor from Sequoia Capital, said four people with knowledge of the situation. The talks with DoorDash and Uber were part of those discussions, some of those people said. (Still, Instacart and Mr. Mehta have said his departure was a voluntary move.)                                                                                                                                      , Before Ms. Simo was named chief executive in July, there was a brief discussion about making her and Mr. Mehta co-chief executives, three people with knowledge of the situation said. That idea was quickly abandoned, and Mr. Mehta became chairman. (The chief executive of The New York Times, Meredith Kopit Levien, joined Instacart’s board of directors in October 2021.)                                                                                                                                        , Carolyn Everson, a former Facebook executive who became Instacart’s president in September, left the company after just three months — the highest-profile departure from the company, which also lost its chief revenue officer as well as the person who was president before Ms. Everson. Ms. Everson was not happy because she ended up spending most of her time working on the company’s relationships with grocery executives, a person with knowledge of the situation said.                                     , Instacart’s business has continued to grow through the management turmoil, hitting $1.8 billion in revenue last year, a person familiar with the business said. But that was far from the quadrupling growth of 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Grocery industry experts and some inside Instacart have floated the idea that the company should cut out grocers by opening its own warehouses of goods, which could be more lucrative. But Ms. Simo has steadfastly opposed the move. Instead, she has tightened Instacart’s relationships with grocers, including Kroger, Publix, Wegmans and Costco.                                                                                                                                                                  , Instacart’s next act hinges on Instacart Platform, a set of new software and advertising tools the company announced in March, with an aim of becoming more of a technology provider to grocery companies. With tools like “Carrot Ads” and “Carrot Insights,” Instacart said it would bring its own advertising capabilities and analytics to grocers’ websites. The company is also introducing fulfillment centers stocked by its grocery store partners to help it deliver products in 15 minutes.                   , But after Instacart Platform was announced, grocery retailers were underwhelmed and confused by how it was different from what Instacart already provided, said seven grocery industry executives and consultants, some of whom asked to speak anonymously to avoid damaging their relationships with Instacart.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Burt Flickinger III, a longtime industry consultant, described the announcement as something “grown in a hothouse at Harvard or Stanford that really had no common-sense, commercial application for the common shopper or retailer.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Retailers have viewed Instacart as a helpful introduction to online delivery but not a necessity, the grocery industry people said. Grocers must pay Instacart fees to be part of the platform, and some think they are better off delivering to customers themselves. Large grocery companies, including Walmart and Albertsons, have also diversified beyond Instacart, offering to deliver groceries through DoorDash, Uber or their own services.                                                                    , Ms. Simo said that Instacart maintained close relationships with its grocer partners and that she had not expected grocers to think the newly announced services were novel, because “I’ve been preaching that vision to them ever since I started.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , She also dismissed concerns about competition: “We have 10 years of experience building grocery products,” she said. “All of the new entrants in the space have, at best, 18 months.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , When Instacart cut its valuation in March, some employees complained that it amounted to a pay cut for employees who were offered shares at the higher price, three employees said. Some of them were given more shares as a result of the cut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ms. Simo has still hired aggressively, with a plan to significantly add to the 1,000 people who joined the company last year. The company now has 3,000 employees, and executives believe new employees will see more upside to being offered stock at a lower price. Still, current and former employees say some prospective candidates have been hesitant to join Instacart because of turnover and because some aren’t sure the company will turn a profit over the long term.                                       , Every week at all-hands meetings, employees have asked Ms. Simo whether Instacart is still on track to go public, two employees said. She has responded that it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “Companies are challenged when they stay private too long,” said Jeremy Abelson, an investor at Irving Investors, which owns shares in Instacart. “The question is: How much meat is left on the bone?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cotton futures rallied to a near eleven-year high of 155 cents a bushel, on signs of stronger overseas demand for US cotton and concerns over supplies from unfavorable weather. The US Department of Agriculture's weekly export sales report showed net sales of 121,100 running bales of cotton for 2021/2022 were up noticeably from the previous week and up 19%from the prior 4-week average. On top of that, there is speculation that India could impose a temporary ban on cotton exports as recent import duties have not been successful in sourcing sufficient stocks. Earlier this month, India, the world's biggest producer of the fibre, announced it would allow duty-free imports of cotton until September 30 as domestic prices jumped to a record high because of a drop in production. </td>

But Labour criticised the plan, calling it a "buy now, pay later scheme".                                                   , Energy firm Utilita has over 800,000 customers, most of them on prepayment smart meters. At the company's headquarters in Eastleigh, Hampshire, the customer call centre has had a busy month, with a 60% increase in call volumes compared to last April, and 40% more applications for interest free loans.                , Sasha Dixon leads the extra care team dealing with the most vulnerable customers, and says it's been a very difficult few weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                             , "I've been with Utilita for seven years, and on this team since it started and this is the worst I've ever seen it," she said."We've had so many distressing cases. So many desperate customers ringing us needing support.                                                                                                  , "We had one customer who phoned us last week who had actually sold all their belongings, just to be able to get money to eat. They had nothing left to sell and were waiting on a benefit payment," she added.                                                                                                               , Utilita's founder and chief executive, Bill Bullen, said April had been a "genuine shock" for household budgets and that the price rises have had an immediate impact.                                                                                                                                                       , Like Citizens Advice, the company has seen a rising number of customers not topping up their meters because they're running out of money. He said they were doing everything they could but there was a limit.                                                                                                               , "The reality of an energy business today is that it's not a profitable business. There's no spare cash to be spending with customers, and that's the really frustrating thing," he said.                                                                                                                                     , "Even in a really good year, you might dream of making a 2% or 3% margin, but that's only around £20 or £30 per customer and what we're seeing here is an increase in bills of around £1,500 a year.                                                                                                                         , "There's no way that supply companies can even begin to address this problem by themselves. It's way out of our league," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Mr Bullen said it was great the government was providing energy bill and council tax rebates, but it was nowhere near focussed enough.                                                                                                                                                                                       , "If they had spent £9bn on the 10 million lowest income households, I think they would have made a bigger dent in the problem," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Instead of having £200 for every household, you could have had £600 for the lowest third of households."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , He said everyone in the industry was 100% focussed on how they were going to get customers through the next winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "I think the shock in October is going to be huge. We are definitely going to see things like unnecessary increased deaths during the winter period, and just genuine hardship. People don't have that extra £1,500," he said.                                                                                               , But with high demand for gas around the world continuing as countries move away from Russian supplies, he's not optimistic that prices will come down significantly any time soon.                                                                                                                                           , "Everybody's hoping this is going to be relatively short lived, but the supply and demand balance to me suggests this is something that's going to go on for years, rather than months," he said.                                                                                                                            , Back to Back 90s tunes to soundtrack your weekend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Gary, Micah and Alan rank their top ten English football derbies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , There's something for everyone on BBC iPlayer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting is here: What to expect from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Warren Buffett is set to kick off Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting Saturday on a high note, with the "Oracle of Omaha" finally back in the deal-making game and the conglomerate's outperforming stock crossing a key milestone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , With tens of thousands of shareholders in attendance, this year's "Woodstock for Capitalists" will return in person in Omaha, Nebraska for the first time since 2019 following Covid-19 disruptions. (CNBC will host the exclusive livestream on Saturday starting at 9:45am ET.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Investors around the globe are waiting to hear from the 91-year-old chairman and CEO, along with his right-hand man Charlie Munger at 98, following a flurry of investment activities — stakes in Occidental Petroleum and HP as well as an acquisition of Alleghany. Not only featuring hours of commentary from the legendary duo, this renowned event will also include exhibits of Berkshire's wide range of holding companies — from ice cream maker Dairy Queen to insurer Geico and battery maker Duracell., "This meeting is for people who are diehard value investors, diehard Buffett and Munger fans like I am," said Whitney Tilson, CEO of Empire Financial Research who has been going to Berkshire's shareholder meeting for 25 consecutive years. "It's an opportunity to learn from the masters. It's just intellectually, psychically and emotionally fulfilling."                                                                                                                                                 , Here are some of the big topics shareholders will want to hear from Buffett:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Berkshire shares are riding high in a volatile market. Class A shares achieved a key milestone last month, topping half a million dollars for the first time as investors embraced the safety of the diversified conglomerate during geopolitical turmoil and surging inflation. The stock is up more than 10% this year, compared to a 10% loss for the S&amp;P 500.                                                                                                                                                 , In 2020's annual meeting during the depth of the pandemic, Buffett offered a much-needed reassurance to investors, saying the U.S. economy will withstand this emergency as it has with all of the previous battles and crises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Nothing can basically stop America," Buffett said. "The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed, and it will do so again. ... In World War II, I was convinced of this ... I was convinced of this during the Cuban Missile Crisis, 9/11, the financial crisis."                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The macroenvironment has grown increasingly difficult for investors this year as the Federal Reserve rushes to tame down 40-year-high inflation with aggressive tightening. Meanwhile, fears of a recession have crept in after a so-called yield-curve inversion and weak prints in economic data. Not to mention that the U.S. is still not out of woods with the pandemic.                                                                                                                                     , "A lot of people have taken hits in their portfolio outside of Berkshire Hathaway, which has done spectacularly. I think there's probably more nervousness out there," Tilson said. "People are looking for wisdom and guidance in a very strange market where there is a war going on and inflation is raging."                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Before the recent buying spree, Buffett had been a net seller of stocks for the past five quarters as he saw few bargains among surging equities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A big driver for Berkshire's outperformance over the past year has been its aggressive buybacks. The company repurchased a record $27 billion worth of its own shares last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "One might expect buybacks to slow down simply because the price of Berkshire has gone up," said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and a Berkshire shareholder. "Buffett will only buy back shares if he considers them to be at a sufficient discount from intrinsic value."                                                                                                                                                                                                         , There was evidence that a reduction has already started. Berkshire used $6.9 billion to buy back shares in the fourth quarter, slower than the $7.6 billion repurchased in the third quarter. Buffett's annual letter revealed that the conglomerate bought back $1.2 billion of its own stock through Feb. 23.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Berkshire's investments lately only made a small dent in his $140 billion-pus war chest, leaving Buffett watchers wonder if a major investment is on the horizon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The recent declines in the stock market resulting from the anticipated tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve may provide additional attractive opportunities for Buffett in the near future," Kass said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In March, Berkshire agreed to buy insurance company Alleghany for $11.6 billion in cash. This transaction will mark Berkshire's biggest acquisition in six years when it bought industrial company Precision Castparts for $37 billion, including debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Still, Buffett has yet to make the "elephant-sized acquisition" he's been touting for years. The investor previously blamed an expensive market for his inaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations Greg Abel has been a top contender for Buffett's successor for years, and a comment by Munger last year caught some attention of investors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In a discussion about Berkshire's future, Munger appeared to unintentionally reveal who might have been designated to eventually replace Buffett as CEO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Greg will keep the culture," Munger said at the 2021 annual meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Investors will look for any formal announcement on the succession front Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ruble hits 2-year high against the dollar as Russia tries to avoid default - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN Business)Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to support the ruble continue to pay off — and then some.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Russia's currency hit a two-year high against the US dollar Friday. The ruble gained ground after the country said it managed to pay back creditors with dollars as Russia tries to avoid a default.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The country's finance ministry said in a statement that it made a $565 million eurobond that was due this year, as well as an $84 million eurobond that was set to mature in 2024. Both payments were made in US dollars, the finance ministry claimed, as required by the bond's contract stipulations.                                                                                 , "The payments were made in the currency of issue of the corresponding eurobonds — in US dollars," Russia's finance ministry said in a statement. "In this way, the obligations of servicing sovereign eurobonds are being carried out in observance of the conditions laid out in the issue documentation."                                                                              , On April 6, Russia said it had made the payments on those bonds in rubles, leading S&amp;P to declare three days later that Russia was in default on its foreign debt obligations. Although the dollar payments are already overdue, Russia's late payment in dollars serves as a last-ditch effort to avoid default.                                                                        , Bond payments typically come with a 30-day grace period. For these bond payments, that grace period ends May 4. We may never know if S&amp;P changes its mind about Russia's default. Because of sanctions, the credit-rating agency pulled its rating on Russian debt on April 15.                                                                                                          , Russia has the money to pay its debts. It just can't access about half of those funds after the West placed unprecedented sanctions on its foreign reserves, totaling about $315 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                , But Russia has apparently found a way to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in debt without accessing its frozen reserves. A US Treasury official said the payment must have come from a new pile of money, because it did not lift its restrictions on Russia's sanctioned dollars, according to Reuters.                                                                          , The news sent the Russian ruble, which has been surging for two months, to a two-year high against the US dollar. One dollar could buy about 68 rubles Friday, less than half the number it could buy in early March. At its peak on March 7, the ruble was trading at 135 to the dollar.                                                                                                , Russia has been able to prop up the ruble despite global sanctions by hiking interest rates, preventing Russian brokers from selling securities held by foreigners and demanding payment for gas and oil deliveries in rubles, among other actions. These measures have allowed Moscow to artificially manufacture demand for the ruble, even as the nation's economy remains in tatters., The country has since been able to scale back on its dramatic rate hikes, including another surprise rate cut Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , — CNN's Clare Sebastian contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Madrid Stocks Rise for 3rd Session </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IBEX 35 rose about 0.85% to close at 8,584 on Friday, extending gains for the third session, in line with its European peers, boosted by corporate earnings and hopes of policy support in China. Spain's BBVA topped estimates with a 36.4% year-on-year rise in first-quarter net profit, driven by a strong performance in emerging markets, while competitor CaixaBank said its first-quarter net profit rose 22% compared to the same period a year ago when stripping out hefty accounting gains from the Bankia acquisition. Meanwhile, the latest data showed Spain’s GDP grew 0.3% on quarter in Q1, less than expectations of a 0.5% expansion. The IBEX 35 advanced 1.65% in April, the first monthly gain so far this year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russian Stocks Rebound to End Week </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The MOEX Russia Index ended 2.6% higher at the 2,445 on Friday, rebounding from last session’s losses, supported by banks and the energy sector as investors digested the central bank’s 300bps interest rate cut. VTB gained 5.1%, following news that it could merge with state-backed banks Otkritie and RNCB. The energy sector also improved, with Lukoil shares surging 7.3% higher despite its refusal to publish quarterly results, while Gazprom appreciated 1.2%. Still, the index ended the month nearly 10% lower after resuming trading from a month-long suspension on March 24. Since then, movements in Russian markets have been artificially supported by capital controls, including a ban on short selling of stocks and a prohibition on foreigners from selling Russian equities. Selling momentum also came as suspension of dividend payments have been a common occurrence since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with sweeping sanctions from Western states pressuring Russian firms across all sectors. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Elon Musk sells $8.5bn worth of Tesla shares </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has sold roughly $8.5bn (£6.8bn) worth of shares in the electric car maker, just days after he agreed to buy Twitter.                                      , The sale has led to speculation that it will help to finance his planned $44bn buyout of the social media platform.                                                                        , Twitter's board agreed on Monday to accept a takeover offer from Mr Musk.                                                                                                                  , Shares in Tesla fell sharply earlier this week, amid speculation that Mr Musk would sell part of his stake in the carmaker to fund the deal.                                               , He tweeted on Thursday evening that he had no plans to sell any more of his shares in the electric carmaker.                                                                               , Filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Mr Musk sold a total of 9.6 million Tesla shares this week.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 closed 0.5% higher at 7,545 in the last session of April, in line with its European peers, as investors gauged another slew of UK earnings, while cautiously awaiting the Bank of England meeting next week.

Meanwhile, AstraZeneca reported core EPS of $1.89, beating market forecasts of $1.70 as sales came higher than expected, and confirmed its 2022 outlook. On the data front, a closely-watched survey showed UK house price growth slowing more than expected in April amid the ongoing squeeze on household incomes and rising interest rates.

A severe Covid lockdown in China and the invasion of Ukraine are worsening disruptions in the flow of goods across borders, contributing to rising food and energy prices, and threatening corporate profits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , On Friday alone, the S&amp;P 500 slid 3.6 percent after the tech giants Amazon and Apple reported their results for the start of the year, crystallizing fears of rising costs and supply constraints. Analysts say Wall Street’s pessimism isn’t likely to end until the major concerns are resolved, and when that will happen seems impossible to know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , What matters most is the impact that all of this will have on consumers, who account for the largest share of economic activity in the United States. While consumer spending has held up for now, several measures show that their confidence is eroding quickly, and economists expect demand to slow as people face high prices and rising borrowing costs at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “The consumer is the main driver of the U.S. economy,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. “So how the consumer goes, so goes the economy.” Ms. Bostjancic said that as the Fed continues to raise rates this year and into next year, “we see more vulnerability for the consumer and risks of a consumer pullback rise.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Ms. Bostjancic’s firm has reduced its expectations for gross domestic product growth this year to 3.1 percent, compared with 5.7 percent reported for 2021. But the outlook for 2023 is where concerns are particularly evident. Oxford Economics is forecasting that growth will slow to 2 percent, but others are predicting a recession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , S&amp;P 500 daily close through April 29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , What the Federal Reserve does and says will be crucial. The central bank raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in March, after having held them near zero since the coronavirus pandemic began. With consumer prices already rising at the fastest pace in four decades, that move was largely expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But in April, Fed officials began to shift their view, expressed in speeches and other public comments, on how quickly interest rates will have to rise to get inflation under control. Wall Street’s economic projections shifted, too. In the futures market, where traders bet on how high interest rates could go, the predominant view now is that the Fed’s benchmark rate will climb to around 2 percent by July — something that seemed unimaginable even a month ago.For that to happen, the central bank would have to raise its policy rate by half a percentage point at each of its next three meetings, starting with an increase next week, and the fear is that such aggressive increases will trigger an economic slump, rather than just cooling things down enough to slow inflation but keep the economy growing., “Every time the Fed has spoken, markets have taken it fairly negatively,” said Saira Malik, chief investment officer at Nuveen, a global investment manager. “Investors are concerned that with these multiple rate hikes, the Fed is going to cause a recession rather than a soft landing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Higher interest rates will hit consumer demand. Mortgage rates, for example, have already jumped above 5 percent from 3.2 percent at the start of the year, eating up new home buyers’ budgets. Other borrowing costs, on everything from consumer loans to corporate debt, will rise as the Fed pushes its benchmark rate higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , For now, many companies — from United Airlines to PepsiCo — are passing on rising costs and reporting that sales continue to rise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The job market remains strong, and the government’s report on gross domestic product on Thursday highlighted the resilience in consumer spending, which rose in the first three months of the year. But economists are wondering how long this will continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “There’s going to be a natural slowdown in spending, maybe before interest rates increase, as costs increase,” said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute. “The central bank will need to monitor that very carefully because, if it happens naturally and then you add interest rate increases, this is how you get to a recession scenario.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Broadly speaking, earnings reports have shown that profit growth continues, and results from some big firms, like Microsoft and Facebook’s parent, Meta Platforms, did briefly ease the panic on Wall Street. About 80 percent of companies in the S&amp;P 500 to report results through Thursday did better than analysts had expected, data from FactSet shows.But other companies have only added to the downdraft. Netflix plunged after it said last week that it expected to lose subscribers — 200,000 in the first three months of the year, and an additional two million in the current quarter. The stock dropped more than 49 percent for the month.                                                                                                                                                                         , On Friday, Amazon slid 14.1 percent after it reported its first quarterly loss since 2015, citing rising fuel and labor costs and warning that sales would slow. Its shares fell 23.8 percent in April.General Electric warned on Tuesday that the economic fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would weigh on its results. Its shares fell 10 percent that day and about 18.5 percent for the month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The war, which began in February, brought a new risk to the fragile global supply chain: Western countries’ sanctions on Russia, including a ban on oil imports from the country by the United States, and European promises to limit purchases of Russian oil and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Now, executives are also assessing how the Covid-19 lockdowns in China, which has the world’s second-largest economy, could affect profit margins. Multiple Chinese cities are on lockdown, and although factories remain open, the country’s draconian “zero Covid” policy has led to interruptions in shipments and delays in delivery times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Texas Instruments Inc. and the machinery maker Caterpillar cautioned investors this week that the lockdowns in China were affecting the company’s manufacturing operations. On Thursday, Apple also warned that the outbreak there would hamper demand and production of iPhones and other products. The company’s shares fell 3.7 percent on Friday, and ended April with a loss of 9.7 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The outlook for the economy, the effects of the Ukraine invasion, the lockdowns in China and exactly how fast the Fed will raise interest rates are still not clear. Markets are likely to stay volatile until they are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “There are definitely a lot of open-ended and unquantified risks looming,” said Victoria Greene, the chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm. “The U.S. economy lives and dies for the consumer, and as soon as this consumer starts to slow down, I think that will hit the economy hard.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Italian Stocks End Friday Higher </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB index closed 0.8% higher at 24,252 on Friday, supported by the banks and the energy sector as investors digested corporate earnings reports and a batch of macroeconomic data. Tenaris extended last session’s gains by 5.3%, after the steel pipe producer more than tripled its core profit due to higher oil prices and forecasted a rise in sales for Q2 in the middle east and South America. In the meantime, Eni closed 1.8% higher after reporting $4 billion in profits during Q1, after emphasizing it seeks to find alternative gas supplies outside of Russia. On the macroeconomic front, the Italian GDP contracted by 0.2% quarterly in Q1 of 2022, while consumer prices decelerated for the first time since September of 2020. Still, producer prices rose at a record rate. On the month, the FTSE MIB fell 3%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European Stocks Extend Gains </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> European stocks finished the last trading day of April on a high note, with the regional STOXX 600 and the DAX 30 advancing 0.7% each, driven by consumer and materials stocks. The immediate catalyst for the move was a fresh economic stimulus pledge from China and a slew of upbeat earnings. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker’s Q1 sales surprised on the upside, as new therapies for kidney disease and rare conditions offset expected lower COVID-19 vaccine sales. Johnson Matthey jumped almost 20% after standard Investments, the investment arm of Standard Industries in the United States, acquired a 5.23% stake in the British chemicals company. On the data front, eurozone inflation hit a record high for the sixth consecutive month in April. Meantime, its economy expanded by 0.2 % in the first three months of 2022, the least since the bloc exited a recession last year. Still, the DAX 30 index ended Abril roughly 0.5% lower to post its fourth consecutive monthly decline. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada Government Budget Gap Shrinks in February </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s government budget deficit narrowed to CAD 5.5 billion in February 2022 from CAD 14.4 billion in the corresponding month of the previous year. Revenues jumped by 48.1 percent year-on-year to CAD 43.2 billion, largely reflecting an increase in tax revenues and other revenues. Program expenses excluding net actuarial losses were down CAD 5.7 billion, or 13.9 percent, in large part reflecting decreased transfers under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and Canada Recovery Benefits. Public debt charges were up CAD 0.3 billion, or 19.8 percent, reflecting higher interest on the government's pension and other employee future benefit obligations, higher interest on marketable bonds, and higher Consumer Price Index adjustments on Real Return Bonds. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago wheat futures fell below $10.7 per bushel in the end of April, the lowest in three weeks, as stronger supply projections eased shortage concerns. The Biden administration proposed a $500 million bill for the farming sector, in an effort for wheat producers to increase crop fields in response to surging grain prices. Support of stronger supply also came from India entering the export market as higher wheat prices enabled famers to divert new crop to private traders instead of state stockpilers. Egypt, the world’s largest importer, is expected to purchase 1 million tonnes of wheat from India, including 240 thousand in April. Wheat prices surged to 14-year highs in March due to the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian production is expected to significantly stall, with 20% of winter plantations being wasted due to direct consequences from the war, while a declining economy should cut Russia’s output. </td>

Meanwhile, the capesize index, which tracks iron ore and coal cargos of 150,000-tonnes, fell 0.6% to 2,136; and the supramax index shed 2 points to 2,734. The Baltic Dry Index added nearly 2% in April, the third straight month of rises. </td>

While, the conglomerate looked to start off the year slow in terms of investment activity, in three weeks starting Feb. 21, it spent more than $40B, he said. 
 
The company had $143.9B of cash and U.S. Treasury bills at Dec. 31, 2021, and that went down to $102.7B by March 31, 2022.

They are way down, only gamma squeezes, and the shorting against them is both naked and synthetics eclipse the number of real shares 20+ times over.
Much of this is funded via swaps. If you have not seen on my profile take note an Federal informant who worked for Credit Suisse was assassinated in LA this past week. 
Additionally, the feds arrested the head of Archegos Capital, for fraud and racketeering, this was a big short. Melvin capital is liquidating in June. 
And in German news, the Frankfurt court authorized a warrant and a raid was carried out at Deutsche bank, the charges as of yet undisclosed. 

I believe we are seeing more abuse of swaps with all the easy money we had, and whole lot more, in stocks across the market, but in particular, the ultra shorted $GME and $AMC where despite utilization being at 100%, continue to be shorted every day. 
And now, volume is drying up this past week on both. </td>

In regards to Berkshire:

&amp;quot;By approximately 3-to-1 margins, shareholders also rejected proposals to have the company disclose more about the climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions and diversity efforts in its dozens of businesses.

Berkshire&amp;#39;s board also opposed those proposals, saying its operating businesses already disclosed or appropriately managed environmental risks, and were committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.&amp;quot; </td>

&amp;quot;BMW joins Toyota in denouncing a fully electric future

BMW has joined global giant Toyota – and multinational car companies including Jeep, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Citroen and Peugeot – with a warning against the complete phasing out petrol and diesel engines.

The global boss of Toyota, Akio Toyoda, said the goal of the auto industry must be to reduce emissions with a range of technologies that will suit different buyers – in different price ranges – in different countries around the world.

If someone cannot buy an EV for some reason but needs a car, would you rather propose he continues to drive his old car forever?” the BMW CEO stated&amp;quot;.

Bit torn on what rate hike will be.

Could see 25 on the low end, just to calm markets after this week. Would screw markets long term with false sense of confidence.

50 most likely, would love 75 atleast. 50-75 expected on guidance. 

Could also see as much as 100 - would love to see feds just rip the bandaid off and allow a much needed correction, then revisit in a few months to speed up the rebound.

Honestly market needs some cold water to think rationally and would hate fed to not do what’s needed (higher rates needed) so we can get past a quick bear market.

&amp;quot;I have never been more dead than I am right now,&amp;quot; said AOC while attending a disinformation fundraiser. &amp;quot;A privileged white man violently assaulted me by legally buying Twitter and defending free speech! He literally cut off my head and now I am dead!&amp;quot;

An official complaint was filed with the U.S. Secret Service which subsequently reached out to Elon Musk for questioning. Musk has reportedly denied any involvement in AOC&amp;#39;s death and claims the congresswoman is not dead at all.

AOC has claimed Musk&amp;#39;s words are disinformation of the worst sort and have caused her to experience a second death.
&amp;quot;That makes him double guilty!&amp;quot; she wept.

According to sources, Elon Musk was taken to Guantanamo Bay for further questioning &amp;quot;off the books&amp;quot; but then he bought the facility and had himself released.

I’m not saying the turnaround happens tomorrow but I do know if u are long and u have cash on the sidelines it is time to buy/add, slowly bit by bit if u need to. These “crash” opportunities come along every so often and never once in history has the market not come back to make all time highs. Truth is none of us know how deep they need to cut it to create the wealth destruction they seek to combat inflation but we know one thing. Buying the dip doesn’t mean going all in on the dip. Buy slowly buy intelligently and scale in. Great wealth was created in 2008 as no fear no emotion buyers are up everything as fear sellers lost it all. Which one will you be? Cash is not a trade here nor has it ever been. Going all in isn’t a trade. Buying value in opportunities that only come along every so often and buying slowly if you need to but buying is the key.

It’s keep it and your psychology straight in a bear market that matters. With the Fed 8% behind the curve and a GDP report that was negative days ago along with the slowest rate of sales growth from Amazon since 2001 and interest rates skyrocketing to fight off 10% inflation we are seeing a historic bear market unfolding unraveling many a millennials dreams of easy Wall Street profits.

At the head of potency of the King, He engraved engravings in luster on high. A spark of impenetrable darkness flashed within the concealed of the concealed, from the head of Infinity — a cluster of vapor forming in formlessness, thrust in a ring, not white, not black, not red, not green, no color at all. As a cord surveyed, it yielded radiant colors. Deep within the spark gushed a flow, splaying colors below, concealed within the concealed of the mystery of Ein Sof. It split and did not split its aura, was not known at all, until under the impact of splitting, a single, concealed, supernal point shone. Beyond that point, nothing is known. </td>

Yet the American taxpayer has been made to believe that we have an obligation to Ukraine. We don&amp;#39;t. We keep dumping money and weapons there in a futile attempt for them to win a war that they are losing. Pretty much a zero chance of them winning, yet we continue to waste money by offloading cash and weapons and literally watching it go up in smoke.

This is so true.  The bullarket ended in Feb 2021 when growth stocks crashed.  Now its spreading to all the other asset classes.  Insane that $6 trillion in stimulus only got is 1.5 years of growth.  Not ally that would have ushered in a 12 year expansion and booming stock market.  Instead we just got a little bull run for about 1 year and it was over.

The missing piece is everything.

People comparing to 2000 and 2008 are forgetting this.

2000 we were in a historical bubble, and I understand most weren’t alive back then, but we would have to be at NDX 50,000 to recreate that same environment, so that comparison is completely void. 

2008 we had historic banking collapses and ofcourse the entire housing market crash.

Now it’s 2022, what’s the missing piece for this collapse?

Nothing.

We simply are not going to repeat 2000 and 2008, but that doesn’t mean you can’t look to the past.

If you want good points to compare and develop trading ideas off of, look to 2015 and 2018 instead. 

2015 the market was Harassed by similar FED QT, and reacted accordingly, with SPY dropping roughly 16% and not hitting a new ATH for about 18 months.

2018 we had similar geopolitical tensions as we do now, and SPY dropped roughly 20%, 8 month ATH gap.
 
2022 we have FED QT and lesser extent geopolitical tensions, already 14.2% off. </td>

What should we fear, and what are we saved from when we believe in Jesus?  

Hell, or eternal separation from the Lord forever, where only despair and regret remain.

No one likes to talk about that anymore, but the unloving thing to do is to pretend that it&amp;#39;s not a reality, if we deny Jesus&amp;#39; sacrifice for us.

&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;dmit you&amp;#39;re a sinner (Romans 3:10/23)

&amp;quot;B&amp;quot;elieve in Jesus as your Savior (Romans 10:9-10)

&amp;quot;C&amp;quot;all upon His name for forgiveness (Romans 10:13)

My friends, time is getting short.  Believe and put your trust in Jesus right away if you haven&amp;#39;t yet, and let today be the day of your salvation.  ♥️✝️♥️ </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $ATER $SPY $IWM $QQQ Shorting Small Caps has been used as a hedge against adverse market conditions for Tech and Large Caps for decades. This behavior intensified in early 2021 when smart money realized the loose monetary policy wasn&amp;#39;t going to last til 2023 as the Fed originally signaled. As more Hedge Funds caught on they piled on. By the end of 21 many small caps were down 30-70%. This has created an environment where small caps never ran above the trend from 08 while big tech has bubbled into being traded at high forward multiples and well above the market trend. This 22 crash hasn&amp;#39;t even brought large caps back to mean yet. The yellow line is where I believe these markets would be following the 08 trend without the hot money the Fed printed. At this point small caps are actually trading closer to their intrensic value. But instead of adapting to the changes many HFs add on more shorts when they should long small caps as a hedge, and why short squeezes are likely to become common. </td>

Fed going to sound more dovish this Wednesday as the market holds them hostage. Market back to ATH by end of year after fed pivot in the fall. Same bears throwing out ridiculous dot com level meltdown price targets (as expected given euphoria with vix &amp;gt;30 and weekend time to stew on -13% April in Nasdaq) will turn bullish and wonder why they were so blinded with bearishness as to not go long names they once fantasized going long at the current discounted price. The irony is that that fantasy was created at a time when markets were stable or rising and they were experiencing the opposite emotion of FOMO. When the discounted prices get hit the palms get sweaty and mind gets cloudy and everyone around them screams that this is the dot com bubble repeat. Rinse and repeat.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $GLD , $WEAT, $SQQQ , $AAPL  During a bear market, like we have had so far in 2022 where is the best place to park money?  (Assuming 2022 closes red on the year and assuming we continue to have double digit inflation.) 
1.) Cash - the problem with this approach is that one loses 0 on paper, but 10% in reality (more, imo) based on the real rate of inflation. 
2.) Gold (I know physical gold is better) but for the sake of trading, let&amp;#39;s use $GLD, which has a YTD return of 5.1% - MUCH better than the QQQ which has lost 22% YTD.  
3.) SQQQ has lost 10.12% because of decay, even with the QQQ dipping by 22%.  Although I buy the SQQQ frequently, it is meant to be used on a ST basis only - NOT a long hold.  (I never hold it continuously for longer than 2 weeks.) 
4.) the best run tech co on the planet -- AAPL? It has lost 13%. 
5.)  WEAT - is up 43% YTD 
 
Gold historically rises FASTER than inflation during the years we have had double digit inflation - it seems cheap to me here.  WEAT also. </td>

My thoughts on the week ahead ... 

Below is the Game Plan I sent out to members last Sunday in which I pointed out this past week was the most important week of the year. I pointed out not only the significance of the &amp;quot;Generals&amp;quot; (AAPL, MSFT, FB, GOOGL, AMZN), but I was also worried about the economic data and mostly the PCE on Friday. 

I warned on AMZN. I warned on buying into any strength, as it should be sold. My technical target for this past week was SPY 410/415. We closed at 412. 

My new Game Plan goes out tomorrow (email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com to join). 

In it, I will discuss the new technical levels, my shopping list as I suspect a specific day this week we may get a big reversal off of lows, and stocks I like long term that are on my radar as well as the ones I want to trade short term. 

The mkt has played out as I&amp;#39;ve expected, first half selloff, 2nd half rebound. I&amp;#39;ve been consistent all year, sell the rallies. Buckle up! </td>

No one wants to get the flu, which is why you should eat healthy, exercise and take the proper vitamins to make certain your immune system is boosted year round. Now, should the countries of the world have locked down. Of course they shouldn’t have. The mask, the lockdowns and the experimental vaccines were all nonsense. All smoke and mirrors, to destroy the economies of the world and create high inflation. High inflation is affecting everyone across the globe except of course the wealthy. This is all mere common sense. When you choose to look at the information subjectively rather than as a Democrat or a Republican, then you can see the truth of what is happening. Dementia Joe is going to create equality and save America! The guy is doing the opposite of everything he says. If you’re an adult who considers themselves intelligent, then you have to realize the scam that is taking place. ✌🏻 </td>

“It’s worth watching, though mostly for how it shows how very, very little Musk understands about all of this. Indeed, what struck me about his views is how much they sound like what the techies who originally created social media said in the early days. And here’s the important bit: all of them eventually learned that their simplistic belief in how things should work does not work in reality and have spent the past few decades trying to iterate. And Musk ignores all of that while (somewhat hilariously) suggesting that all of those things can be figured out eventually, despite all of the hard work many, many overworked and underpaid people have been doing figuring exactly that out, only to be told by Musk he’s sure they’re doing it wrong.”

Not sure if this has already gone into effect or not, but I think that it would make sense that it would.  We already know that on May 3rd the collateral requirements are increased GREATLY and that includes MBSD (Mortgage Based Security Deposits).  So, basically, I think the DTCC has said a few weeks ago that they were raising the required CASH demanded for certain &amp;#39;situations&amp;#39; related to MBSD.  I think that starting May 3rd, there will be more &amp;#39;situations&amp;#39; ( FEES ). 
 
Alright, I am done playing &amp;#39;Charlie does the DTCC&amp;#39;.   
 
In short ( pun intended), it is getting a whole lot more expensive to be shorty.

&amp;quot;BMW joins Toyota in denouncing a fully electric future

BMW has joined global giant Toyota – and multinational car companies including Jeep, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo, Citroen and Peugeot – with a warning against the complete phasing out petrol and diesel engines.

The global boss of Toyota, Akio Toyoda, said the goal of the auto industry must be to reduce emissions with a range of technologies that will suit different buyers – in different price ranges – in different countries around the world.

If someone cannot buy an EV for some reason but needs a car, would you rather propose he continues to drive his old car forever?” the BMW CEO stated&amp;quot;.

Oh, the &amp;#39;no double dipping part&amp;#39;: 
 
Appendix A 
 
In general, Section 23A and Regulation W limit the aggregate amount of “covered transactions” between a bank  
and any single affiliate of the bank. “Covered transactions” include, among other things, a bank’s acceptance of  
securities or other debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extension of credit to any  
person or company.4 Thus, to avoid running afoul of the restrictions imposed by Section 23A and Regulation W,  
the LOC Agreement excludes Lender FIS as eligible collateral. 
 
In order to align the collateral value that DTC assigns to Lender FIS with the LOC Agreement, as part of DTC’s risk  
management controls, DTC applies a 100% haircut and assigns no collateral value to any current or future Lender  
FIS held as Net Additions in a Participant account </td>

&amp;quot;I have never been more dead than I am right now,&amp;quot; said AOC while attending a disinformation fundraiser. &amp;quot;A privileged white man violently assaulted me by legally buying Twitter and defending free speech! He literally cut off my head and now I am dead!&amp;quot;

An official complaint was filed with the U.S. Secret Service which subsequently reached out to Elon Musk for questioning. Musk has reportedly denied any involvement in AOC&amp;#39;s death and claims the congresswoman is not dead at all.

AOC has claimed Musk&amp;#39;s words are disinformation of the worst sort and have caused her to experience a second death.
&amp;quot;That makes him double guilty!&amp;quot; she wept.

According to sources, Elon Musk was taken to Guantanamo Bay for further questioning &amp;quot;off the books&amp;quot; but then he bought the facility and had himself released.

They are fully aware of the risk that these banks and funds bring to the DTCC and wisely the DTCC is requiring more stringent controls to reign in the most wildly over leveraged among them.  I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what the following means, but I think this is sort of saying, &amp;#39;we are not going to allow you to &amp;quot;double dip&amp;quot;, that is count one bank and another bank which both are pointing to the same assets and thus appear to have twice the collateral that you really do. 
 
In effect May 3rd, Tuesday.  Next week will be a very, very interesting week.  I expect the various buttcoins to take a tremendous hit in the next couple of days as new collateral will need to be raised by these institutions.   
 
Now, if only Mr. Ryan Cohen and the GameStop board could announce something very short unfriendly next week too. 
 
Maybe even Mr. Elon Musk.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA Interesting point in Barron&amp;#39;s Article... so many people concerned about Margin Call on Musk - who pledged some of his personal Tesla stock for his loan to buy $TWTR ... 
 
--&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Tesla officers can take loans against their stock as -long as they pledge four times the amount of the loan.&amp;quot; 
 
I am not worried about Elon&amp;#39;s borrowing capacity... he has so much stock and has stated that he is done selling for his purchase for Twitter. 
 
Also, Barron&amp;#39;s round table show this morning  stated that analysts are &amp;quot;handicapping&amp;quot; if the Elon Musk purchase of $TWTR at 50%... hence, $TWTR&amp;#39;s share price is below the bid from Elon to purchase. 
 
Read the Barron&amp;#39;s article... maybe the anticipated shareholder proxy for vote will ask shareholders to vote on a stock split?

My respect for Elon went through the roof the past few weeks. 

He could have done anything with his billions. Bought an island (or a country for that matter), he could have bought some skyscrapers, hundreds of mansions, Boeing, a railroad, dozens of yachts...

Instead he bought Twitter. 

Do I think it was fully altruistic? No. He&amp;#39;ll increase the user base and then probably bring it public in 4-5 years. 

But who cares? He&amp;#39;s giving everybody the opportunity to exercise the 1A. Which is more good than any other billionaire has done in the last 50 years. 

Awesome guy. Total respect. 

And his Tweets? Legendary. They get better every day. 

Yesterday was just 😂

I got an earful for criticism of Buffett. So I&amp;#39;ll explain my reasoning. 

Is he the greatest accountant ever? Yes.

Top stock picker all time? No. Top 10? Yes. 

Peter Lynch is #1 all time. He has something nobody else has.

Why do I criticize Buffett?

1. He talks about how INCOME tax rates on billionaires need to increase. 

&amp;quot;Buffett reiterated his support for changes to the tax code that would reduce wealth inequality.&amp;quot;

Then why not &amp;quot;pay your fair share&amp;quot;? 🧐

I am for him paying $0 in taxes for all I care. Honestly. But don&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;billionaires should pay more&amp;quot; and then pay a 0.10% tax rate (link). 

At least Elon doesn&amp;#39;t say this 🐂 💩. 

https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax

2. He said:
&amp;quot;Warren Buffett says eliminating the estate tax would be a &amp;#39;terrible mistake&amp;#39;&amp;quot;

Except he gave all his wealth to the Gates Foundation for the purpose of avoiding estate &amp;amp; gift tax!

Hypocrite much? 🤔

But with MULN, if just 1 catalyst hit, I think it will surpass 2.66 which is 100%. Increase. If 2 catalyst hit, looking at surpassing 4.00 for 200%.
If all 3 catalyst hit , minimum of 5.00 which is 275% increase. Now end of the year, which of these stock would you want to hold?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY So Elon having a spat w/ AOC just shows why having a wealthy 9yr old in charge of everything isn&amp;#39;t that good. 
 
Its amazing how if you&amp;#39;re famous in America people think you can do everything. reminds me of Trump &amp;amp; Health Care. &amp;quot;Who knew it was this hard?&amp;quot; 
 
Elon can&amp;#39;t fix what can&amp;#39;t be fixed. Its why everyone hates Zuck, you can&amp;#39;t police this on either side. It wont work &amp;amp; he&amp;#39;s going to bleed $TSLA &amp;amp; for what? so the world can share how we feel about 90% of things no one cares about? 
 
Oh Elon,.. &amp;quot;Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand&amp;quot; - Scott Fitzgerald

@Prat_ 

A fascinating article on Elon Musk&amp;#39;s SFO (single-family office). 

The model he&amp;#39;s using is sometimes called a &amp;quot;QB model&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s rather rare. Rare to give that much power to a single individual, because if they go rogue, it&amp;#39;s tougher to stop it quickly. Typically, anybody with $500M-$1+ billion has 3+ individuals in power. 

In this case, it seems this Jared individual would QB with all of Musk&amp;#39;s other advisors. I&amp;#39;m assuming Musk has at least:

 4-5 attorneys (typically two &amp;quot;general counsel&amp;quot; attorneys for any litigation or other legal matters involving him or his family, two corporate law attorneys to handle all corporate law matters with his companies, and an estate planning attorney to handle trust and estate matters)

3-5 investment advisors/portfolio managers to handle all portfolio management responsibilities

2-3 administrative assistants

The QB (Jared) would coordinate with the 10 ish individuals above.

My thoughts on the week ahead ... 

Below is the Game Plan I sent out to members last Sunday in which I pointed out this past week was the most important week of the year. I pointed out not only the significance of the &amp;quot;Generals&amp;quot; (AAPL, MSFT, FB, GOOGL, AMZN), but I was also worried about the economic data and mostly the PCE on Friday. 

I warned on AMZN. I warned on buying into any strength, as it should be sold. My technical target for this past week was SPY 410/415. We closed at 412. 

My new Game Plan goes out tomorrow (email me at jessielivermore1929@gmail.com to join). 

In it, I will discuss the new technical levels, my shopping list as I suspect a specific day this week we may get a big reversal off of lows, and stocks I like long term that are on my radar as well as the ones I want to trade short term. 

The mkt has played out as I&amp;#39;ve expected, first half selloff, 2nd half rebound. I&amp;#39;ve been consistent all year, sell the rallies. Buckle up! </td>

Below 837 a share here requires more Elon sales. Awful timing to buy a failed platform on the backs of burning your investors just as the markets are really beginning to earnestly crash. This deal gets canceled or Tesla trades in the margin call range next. Very bullish Tesla but Elon hosed investors with a circus act hanging over its shares as the markets are crashing. </td>
