   <td style="text-align:left;"> The NAB business confidence index in Australia tumbled to -12 in December 2021 from 12 a month earlier. This was the first negative reading since August and the lowest figure since July 2020, as the spread of the Omicron variant threatened to dampen the economy’s post-lockdown momentum. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> António Horta-Osório: The banker who can't stay out of the headlines </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sir António Horta-Osório is used to the spotlight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , As one of the UK's most high-profile bankers "AHO", as he is known in some circles, is credited with dragging Lloyds Banking Group back from the precipice following the financial crisis.                                                                                                                   , Most recently, however, Sir António has attracted rather more negative headlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After moving to Credit Suisse last April, it emerged that he had twice broken Covid quarantine rules in the UK and Switzerland.                                                                                                                                                                              , Just nine months into his chairmanship of Switzerland's second largest bank, he was out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , It is understood that some at Credit Suisse have been astonished at the attention his resignation has received.                                                                                                                                                                                              , But in the UK, Sir António has always been a colourful character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , He was a relative unknown when, in 2011, he was encouraged by the then Chancellor George Osborne to become the chief executive of Lloyds.                                                                                                                                                                    , Prior to that, the Portuguese banker - he would later become a dual British citizen - was the boss of Spanish giant Santander's UK arm.                                                                                                                                                                      , When Sir António took the job at Lloyds, he was a comparatively youthful 47 years-old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The charming, suave executive stood out in the staid world of banking at the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Sir António was also known to be driven, detail-orientated and utterly relentless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , A keen tennis player - one of his quarantine breaches was to attend last year's men's final at Wimbledon - he also counts chess among his hobbies. He once told The Times: "As a strategy game, it applies very well to business."                                                                           , He's also fond of scuba diving - and swimming with sharks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But it is perhaps these characteristics that led him to the first major crisis of his career when, after just eight months as Lloyds' chief executive, he suddenly took two months of medical leave.                                                                                                         , It was shocking at the time, rattling Lloyds' board and its shareholders with many questioning if he would ever return at all.                                                                                                                                                                               , Sir António later explained that he had discovered that Lloyds was in "a very weak position".                                                                                                                                                                                                                , He told the BBC that the state of the bank was something he had to keep to himself, saying that if he spoke about it "obviously that would not generate confidence in the bank".                                                                                                                             , Lloyds had disastrously decided to rescue HBOS at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. It was then bailed out by the government to the tune of £20.3bn, leaving taxpayers with a 43% stake in the bank.                                                                                               , By the time Sir António joined in 2011, Lloyds was operating within a struggling UK economy while the eurozone crisis raged.                                                                                                                                                                                 , A few months into his job, severe insomnia led to five consecutive nights of no sleep at all which he described "a form of torture".                                                                                                                                                                         , Sir António did come back but only after a spell in the Priory, where he slept for 16-hour stretches, and a great deal of recuperation at his home in Chelsea.                                                                                                                                               , Once back at Lloyds, he was mentored by psychiatrist Dr Stephen Pereira who, he told the Times, advised him to be "more like a palm tree, so when the storm comes the palm tree bends but then comes back up, instead of being like an oak tree and trying to resist the storm, in which case it can break". , While surprising at the time - especially in the take-no-prisoners corporate world - the episode ended up as a positive. Lloyds introduced a mental health programme at the bank including training up thousands of mental health first aiders.                                                              , And when Sir António was knighted in 2020, it was for his services to mental healthcare as well as the financial services industry.                                                                                                                                                                          , But it wasn't all plain-sailing at Lloyds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In 2016, the married father of three was exposed by The Sun for an alleged extra-marital affair - headline "Lloyds bonk".                                                                                                                                                                                    , It prompted an embarrassing memo from the boss to Lloyds staff where Sir António spoke of his regret at the "adverse publicity and damage" caused by the coverage.                                                                                                                                           , The situation wasn't helped by the fact that just three years earlier, Sir António had launched a "Code of Responsibility" at the bank.                                                                                                                                                                      , In it, Lloyds staff employees were urged to "do the right thing" and ask themselves questions such as: "Would I be happy to tell my colleagues, family and friends about my actions?"                                                                                                                        , He has mostly kept quiet about the whole episode, though once, when asked about it, the Jesuit-educated Sir António quoted a bible story about Mary Magdalene to the Financial Times, saying: "Those of you that never sinned, throw the first stones."                                                      , And while Sir António has done much for mental health in the workplace, tens of thousands of people lost their jobs at Lloyds. Also, after a decade at the top of the bank, it is understood Sir Antonio earned, in aggregate, around £60m.                                                                  , During that time, however, he did return the bank to profitability and the government sold its final remaining stake in the bank in 2017.                                                                                                                                                                    , When the bank fully returned to the private sector, Sir António told the BBC: "It was a moment of huge pride for all the colleagues at Lloyds bank [and] for our customers."                                                                                                                                 , There is not, perhaps, much pride at his slightly ignominious exit from Credit Suisse. But Sir António, who turns 58 years-old on 28 January, will undoubtedly be back.                                                                                                                                      , As someone who knows him told the BBC: "We don't need to worry about him too much."                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ricky Gervais chats acting and what his fans mean to him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Join Andi and Miquita Oliver on the journey of a lifetime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , U.S. stock index futures were little changed in overnight trading Monday, after a wildly volatile session that saw the Dow erase a more than 1,100 point decline to finish the day in positive territory.                                                                                                                                                                           , Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 19 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.1%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , During regular trading, the Dow gained 99 points, or 0.3%, and snapped a six-day losing streak. At the lows of the day, the 30-stock benchmark shed 3.25%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.28% for its first positive session in five, after losing nearly 4% earlier in the day. At one point the benchmark index fell into correction territory, dropping 10% from its Jan. 3 record close., The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6%, reversing a 4.9% decline from earlier in the day. The comeback was the first time the tech-heavy index clawed back a 4% loss to end higher since 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                              , "The buyers are coming in to buy the dip here," Lindsey Bell, Ally's chief money and markets strategist, said Monday on CNBC's "Closing Bell."

But that doesn't mean we are going to be in the clear ... there's a lot that we have going on this week," she said                          , Ultimately, Bell said volatility is here to stay until the Fed begins hiking rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee will begin its two-day meeting on Tuesday, with an interest rate decision slated for Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The Fed is not expected to begin hiking rates just yet, so investors will be watching for an indication of when the Fed will begin hiking rates, and the pace of those hikes.                                                , "We're in what I call the triple threat of ... rapidly rising rates, and the market has been working overtime, as have all of the algorithms, to try to figure out what that means, and what that pace means for valuations and global equities," UBS Private Wealth Management's Alli McCartney told CNBC Monday.                                                                  , "Today is capitulation," she said, before adding that while volatility is here to stay, the market narrative is beginning to shift towards one of strong earnings growth supporting stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                         , Jeremy Grantham says the end of 'bubble extravaganza' is coming, calls for stocks to drop 45%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , JPMorgan says hydrogen use is set to boom and picks its top stocks to cash in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Failed market rally signals more trouble ahead for stocks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Monday's volatility follows the S&amp;P 500's worst week since the pandemic took hold in March 2020.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The pilot of a US F-35 jet ejected as his jet crashed on the deck of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the South China Sea, injuring seven, the US Pacific Fleet said in a statement Monday.                                                                                                                                           , The pilot was conducting routine flight operations when the crash happened.

Three required evacuation to a medical facility in Manila, Philippines, where they are in stable condition, according to Pacific Fleet. The other three sailors were treated on the carrier and have been released.                                                                            , The cause of what the statement called a "inflight mishap" is under investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The crash is the first for an F-35C, the US Navy's variant of the single-engine stealth fighter, designed for operations off aircraft carriers.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The F-35A, flown by the Air Force, takes off and lands on conventional runways, and the F-35B, the Marine Corps version, is a short-takeoff vertical landing aircraft that can operate off the Navy's amphibious assault ships.                                                                                                                    , Versions of the F-35 are also flown by US allies and partners, including Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands and Israel.

The Air Force attributed the crash to a variety of factors involving the pilot and the plane's systems.                                                                                                                      , In April 2019, a Japanese F-35 crashed into the Pacific Ocean off northern Japan, killing its pilot. The Japanese military blamed that crash on spatial disorientation, "a situation in which a pilot cannot sense correctly the position, attitude, altitude, or the motion of an airplane," according to the journal Military Medicine.          , When the latest crash occurred, Carl Vinson and its escorts were operating in the South China Sea along with the USS Abraham Lincoln Strike Group in dual-carrier operations that began on Sunday, according to Navy social media accounts.                                                                                                        , The 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea has been the site of frequent naval activity in the past several years as China has asserted its claims over almost all of the area by building up and militarizing islands and reefs.                                                                                                                 , The US military asserts its right to operate freely in what are international waters.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> New Zealand Services Sector Continues Below 50 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The BusinessNZ Performance of Services Index in New Zealand rose to 49.7 in December of 2021 from an upwardly revised 47.2 in the prior month, the fifth straight contraction in the services sector. Among key sub-indices, activity/sales (50.7) recorded its first positive activity level since July, while New Orders/Business (51.7) and stocks/inventories (51) came above the no-change level 50. Meanwhile, Supplier deliveries (49.5) and Employment (49.2) remained below the 50 threshold. BNZ Senior Economist Craig Ebert said that "the PSI and PMI combined leave us cautious as to what to expect for the bounce in GDP for Q4, and momentum into the start of 2022. Of course, the immediate factor is how the economy handles Omicron circulating in the community, under the new traffic light system. Movement into the Red setting impacts gathering limits, which is clearly important to many service industries." </td>

The currency has jumped about 1% so far this year on a spot basis to 114 per dollar, though it remains far weaker than it was after notching a decline of more than 10% in 2021, its worst year since 2014. And while the yen lagged the dollar on Monday as stocks took one of their biggest intraday beatings of recent times, it’s still the standout performer among Group-of-10 currencies this year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada Stocks at 5-Week Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s main stock index, the S&amp;P/TSX, fell 0.2% to close at 20,571 on Monday, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session to the lowest since December 20th, as investors remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting later this week, at which policymakers are set to keep interest rates unchanged but signal their first interest rate hike in March. Also, a negative risk sentiment fueled a rout in heavyweight oil stocks, with energy stocks dropping more than 1.5%. In Canada, hundreds of truckers started a week-long protest against the federal vaccine mandate, which will leave thousands of truckers unable to cross the US-Canada border. </td>

The S&amp;P 500 briefly dipped into correction territory Monday, falling more than 10% from its record high. Technology shares bore the brunt of the washout, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping about 12% in January, now sitting almost 15% below its all-time high. The tech-heavy benchmark pulled off a stunning turnaround Monday, however, closing in the green after losing as much as 4.9%., The stock rout was triggered by a potential policy shift from the Federal Reserve. The central bank has signaled interest rate hikes this year as well as a tapering of asset purchases and a balance sheet reduction. The potential action would mark an aggressive hawkish tilt for the Fed after nearly two years of ultra-easy monetary policy to support the economy from the pandemic.                                                  , "While longs have been getting trounced, short sellers have seen widespread profitable trades in this market wide downturn with 79% of all short side money producing profitable returns in January," said Dusaniwsky, the firm's managing director of predictive analytics.                                                                                                                                                                  , Short sellers seek to profit by anticipating declines in the value of securities. A short seller borrows shares of a stock and sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay the market price. As the stock price falls, the trader would buy it back for less money, pocketing the difference.                                                                                                                                        , The most profitable short bet this year has been against Tesla, which experienced a near 12% decline. Short sellers betting against the electric vehicle company have gained $2.3 billion in mark-to-market profits as of Friday, according to S3.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Bets against Netflix have also been particular lucrative. Shares of the streaming giant have fallen a whopping 35% this year after the company admitted that streaming competition is eating into its subscriber growth. The drastic sell-off has translated into a $1.6 billion gain for short-sellers.                                                                                                                                      , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi warns Americans are feeling the labor shortage 'big time' amid a confluence of events, calling it a 'nightmare.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , While Americans rang in 2022, small businesses across the country braced for a gut punch to their budgets. Twenty-two states raised their respective minimum wages on January 1 and another three are scheduled to do the same later this year. Additionally, more than 50 cities and counties are jumping on the bandwagon.                                                                                                                                                                                    , As a result, small businesses will be feeling the heat in 2022. And once the tight labor market loosens and the economy resets, employees will as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , PORTLAND RESTAURANT OWNER BLAMES DEMOCRATS FOR BUSINESS DOWNFALL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The consequences of raising the minimum wage too much too quickly is well-documented. When businesses can’t pass along heightened labor costs to price sensitive customers, the budget gap must be made up somehow. Reducing staff hours, cutting back on workers, and introducing more automation are common tactics. (Replacing staff with machines is even more attractive now given the pandemic-era labor shortage.)                                                                                       , If naturally occurring, the cycle of creative destruction is healthy. It weeds out the economy so small businesses have room to grow into bigger, more successful ones that generate more opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi discusses the mask mandates taking effect in different states and the impact it will have on small businesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Believe it or not, even the major company I used to lead was once a small business. You may have heard of it: McDonald’s. But when the heavy hand of government dictates wage floors or implements over-the-top regulations, it sparks financial distress that wounds or kills what would ordinarily be successful enterprises in their infancy.                                                                                                                                                                , The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has previously estimated what this upheaval looks like. Their report from last February finds that applying a one-size-fits-all $15 minimum wage nationwide would trigger job loss to the tune of 1.4 million positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , RETAIL EXPERT WARNS RISE IN CRIME COULD 'CATALYZE THE NEXT RECESSION'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Translation: After somewhat raising consumer prices, businesses will be forced to grapple with layoffs and explore automation to address the difference to stay in business. The alternative is throwing in the towel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , DeLuca's Italian Restaurant Owner Rob DeLuca shares how the restaurant industry has been affected by the massive omicron surge on 'Fox Business Tonight.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , And the impact would likely be even more dramatic now compared to when the CBO report was released nearly a year ago. Given the inflationary effects of fast-and-loose government spending now being experienced by consumers, raising prices further to offset the extra labor costs is not a feasible option—that is, if you want to avoid customer mutiny. Therefore, employers must rely on the other, more painful budget fixes.                                                                           , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Three and a half million jobs that existed before the pandemic—largely concentrated among entry-level positions—are still missing in action. How many of those aren’t going to come back because of minimum wage increases or other government manipulation? Beyond those positions, how many new jobs will be sidelined and performed by robots?                                                                                                                                                               , Young people—especially those among minority groups—will be kicked the hardest. The hidden cost of unrealized job opportunities will trigger a domino effect that compromises their futures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The lion’s share of entry-level opportunities that pay the minimum wage are leveraged by young workers or minorities with little job experience. Why? Because for many, it’s their first job and will help them gain experience to achieve a better-paying career down the road. I experienced this path firsthand. Beginning in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 22, I began my career at McDonald’s—first working as grill cook and then working my way through the ranks to eventually become president and CEO. , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , This career ladder needs to be preserved for future generations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Naturally rising wages are a good thing because it’s usually associated with a strong economy. But when governments decide to dictate labor costs, employers and their workers get the short end of the stick. For the sake of budding entrepreneurs attempting to get their footing and Americans searching for a career path, policymakers should avoid raising the minimum wage further.                                                                                                                     , The next future CEO will be searching for their first gig.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Ed Rensi is the former President and CEO of McDonald’s USA and a member of the Job Creators Network.   </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> It’s no secret that finding childcare isn’t easy, and the pandemic has only made it worse. But one South Carolina business seems to have found a solution for their employees who have kids.                                                                     , It's no secret that finding affordable child care services is difficult and the pandemic has only exacerbated the issue for parents across the United States. However, one South Carolina business seems to have found a solution for their employees with kids. , Although McGee's Scot-Irish Pub is called a pub, it’s really more of a restaurant. And now it includes a closed-off room with a licensed child care provider that many are calling a lifesaver.                                                                  , "I mean, honestly, without them I don’t know where I’d be working," fry cook Summer Rochester told FOX Business.                                                                                                                                                 , Rochester’s 2-year-old son, Jameson, is the reason why she applied to work at McGee’s.                                                                                                                                                                           , "I was paying $600 a month for child care so that got pretty rough on us," Rochester said.                                                                                                                                                                       , About six months ago, the Anderson, South Carolina restaurant hired a licensed child care worker to watch over their staff’s kids.                                                                                                                               , And it’s completely free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "I don't think people should have to choose between having a family and having a career," said the restaurant’s co-owner Dixie Benca.                                                                                                                            , RISING CHILD CARE COSTS FORCED 38% OF PARENTS ON TAKE ON SIDE GIGS, SURVEY SAYS: HOW YOU CAN AFFORD EXPENSES                                                                                                                                                     , One South Carolina business seems to have found a solution for their employees who have kids.

McGee’s was not immune to the hiring challenges that many restaurants have faced during the pandemic, but the new incentive turned things around.                                                    , "And now we are fully staffed," Benca said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , CLICK HERE TO GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , There are certain guidelines for this type of child care service. While most rules will depend on the state, Benca says South Carolina rules say children can’t be here more than four hours at a time. Most parents tend to be on shorter shifts.               , Still, the employees FOX Business spoke to hope that this type of idea will catch on elsewhere because it’s been such a big help to them. </td>

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., introduced different versions of similar legislation.                                                                                                                                                              , Hawley's version is titled, "Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act," and Ossoff's is called the "Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Lawmakers' spouses are currently allowed to trade in companies or industries that their partner may help regulate. But under the STOCK Act, which was passed in 2012, members of Congress and their families are forbidden to profit from inside information, and lawmakers are also required to report stock trades to Congress within 45 days.                                                                           , Meanwhile, President Biden will "let members of Congress" determine whether they should be allowed to trade stocks, amid scrutiny of lawmakers’ financial trades, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Psaki was asked whether the president believes members of Congress and their spouses should be prohibited from trading stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Biden is prohibited from trading stocks while serving as president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "The president didn’t trade individual stocks when he was a senator," Psaki said. "That is how we approach things. We also believe that everyone should be held to the highest standard."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , She added: "But he’ll let members of the leadership in Congress and members of Congress determine what the rules should be."   </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN Business)A cruise ship heading to Miami changed course to the Bahamas Saturday after a US judge issued an arrest warrant for the ship due to unpaid fuel bills.                                                                                                                    , If the Crystal Symphony had continued course to Miami, it would have been seized by authorities. So it headed to Bimini instead, as USA Today first reported. The ship is still docked at the Bahama port, according to a cruise ship tracker.                                                   , The saga began Wednesday, when Peninsula Petroleum Far East filed a lawsuit in a South Florida federal court against Crystal Cruises, alleging it owed unpaid fuel bills totaling more than $4.6 million — of which $1.2 million is for Crystal Symphony specifically.                           , On Thursday, a US judge issued an arrest warrant ahead of the ship's scheduled Saturday arrival in Miami, meaning the ship would be seized by a US Marshal and court-appointed custodian.                                                                                                        , Crystal Cruises said about 300 passengers were transferred by ferry on Sunday from Bimini, Bahamas, to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. In a statement to the Associated Press, a spokesperson said that the ferry ride to Fort Lauderdale was "uncomfortable due to inclement weather." , "This end to the cruise was not the conclusion to our guests' vacation we originally planned for," the cruise line said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                          , The cruise ship can hold up to 848 guests, though the total number of passengers on the ship is unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Also on Wednesday, the day the lawsuit was filed, Crystal Cruises announced it was suspending operations for its ocean voyages through late April and its river cruises through May.                                                                                                             , "Suspending operations will provide Crystal's management team with an opportunity to evaluate the current state of business and examine various options moving forward," the cruise line said in a statement.                                                                                    , The company's two cruises currently in operation — one heading to Aruba and one bound for Argentina — will complete their voyages. Guests who have booked future trips will receive a full refund.                                                                                               , "This was an extremely difficult decision but a prudent one given the current business environment and recent developments with our parent company, Genting Hong Kong," said Jack Anderson, Crystal's president.                                                                                 , Genting Hong Kong, which is one of Asia's largest cruise operators, is about to enter liquidation as the pandemic has decimated the cruise industry worldwide.                                                                                                                                   , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Here's why stocks are on such shaky ground to start January </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , It was a wild day for stocks on Monday, adding to the market's shaky start to 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 1,000 points, before coming back to close about 100 points higher. The S&amp;P 500 was off by nearly 4% at its session low but managed to eke out a small gain. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6% after falling as much as 4.9%.                                                                                                                                       , Despite the late-day jumps, both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on pace for their worst month since March 2020, when the market fell into turmoil amid the pandemic. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, is still headed for its biggest one-month loss since October 2008.                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Though some areas of the market considered more expensive or speculative began to struggle in November, the broader market took a big step back during the first week of January following increasing hints from the Federal Reserve that the central bank will take aggressive action to slow down the jump in consumer prices.                                                                                 , "Over the past month, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it increasingly clear that it is serious about fighting that inflation," the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a note to clients on Jan. 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The central bank has signaled that it plans to stop its asset purchases, hike rates and possibly reduce its balance sheet, starting in March. Government bond yields have surged in preparation for the rate increases, with the U.S. 10-year Treasury rising more than 40 basis points this year alone to nearly 1.9% at its high point after finishing last year just above 1.5%. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.), Investors are now expecting four rate hikes this year, with some officials warning that more may be needed, after most Wall Street pros expected just one or two hikes a few months ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "The Dec. 15 minutes that came out on Jan. 5, they were a shock to investors," Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research, said on CNBC's "Halftime Report" on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Fed will give its latest update on Wednesday. While it's unlikely to raise rates at this meeting, market experts believe the central bank will stick with its plan tighten financial conditions despite the market decline given the high level of inflation.                                                                                                                                                , Concerns about persistent inflation, supply chain disruptions from new Covid variants and the potential for conflict in Ukraine are other factors that have weighed on the risk appetites for investors.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Technology stocks with high valuations got hit first and are continuing to get hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Last week, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite fell into correction territory, marking a 10% drop from its November 2021 record close. At one point on Monday, the index was just a few percentage points away from reaching a bear market.                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Climbing bond rates typically disproportionally punish growth stocks as their future earnings growth become less attractive as rates rise. The growth expectations for tech stocks have also weakened as Wall Street analysts have gotten a better sense of what the post-pandemic economy may look like.                                                                                                        , "Since the end of 3Q21, 2022 earnings estimates for [the Nasdaq 100] fell 0.8%, while estimates for the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.9%, indicating weaker fundamentals for Growth stocks relative to the overall market," Bank of America equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian said in a note on Monday.                                                                                                            , Many of the biggest stocks in the market are tech names, so their declines can have a major impact on market averages. Now, the selling pressure is feeding on itself as investors dump risk assets, dragging every stock sector but energy down in January.                                                                                                                                                     , The cryptocurrency market has been hit hard as well. The price of bitcoin fell briefly below $34,000 on Monday morning, bringing its year-to-date losses to roughly 30%. Since its record high in November, the largest cryptocurrency has lost about 50%.                                                                                                                                                       , The price of ethereum has seen a similar decline over that time period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , To be sure, the health of the economy is looking good. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9% after a record year of nonfarm payrolls growth. Other metrics of economic growth are positive, even if they show a slower recovery than in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                 , Earnings season is also turning out to be a strong one, despite some disappointing reports from high-profile firms. More than 74% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results have topped Wall Street's earnings expectations, according to FactSet.                                                                                                                                                         , Covid-19 cases are also coming down. After exploding to staggering new highs amid the spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant, Covid-19 cases started to come down in New York State over the last two weeks, according to Gov. Kathy Hochul, leading to hope that other areas of the U.S. can see a similarly quick wave.                                                                            , -CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures fell almost 2% to aorund $83.5 a barrel on Monday as a stronger dollar was enough to offset the possibility of supply disruptions. The dollar index strengthened to a 2-week high above 96 on Monday amid a flight to safety due to increasing tensions between the US and Russia over Ukraine and the possibility of a more hawkish stance from the Fed. Meanwhile, the UAE defense ministry said it destroyed two Yemen's Houthi ballistic missiles targeting the country after a drone attack hit an oil facility and airport in Abu Dhabi last week. Also, the International Energy Agency said last week that the OPEC+ missed its production targets by 790,000 bpd in December as members like West African producers Nigeria and Angola struggled to raise output. </td>

"Gold is clearly finding favor as portfolio insurance," said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault. "Rising interest rates would typically offer a headwind to gold, but the risk of a [Federal Reserve] mistake in hiking too late is now worsened by the political impossibility of rescuing equity investors with cheap money," he said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Uranium futures fell to $45.4 per pound in the end of January, the lowest in two weeks, amid eased concerns of supply shortages and worries of lower demand. Fears of interrupted production in Kazakhstan, responsible for 40% of global uranium supply, waned after political unrest in the country did not affect mining of nuclear fuel or its supply chain, as traders previously feared. In the meantime, European countries continue to debate over the role of nuclear energy in future electricity generation. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz repeatedly objected the European Union’s draft plan to label nuclear power plants as a sustainable energy source, citing high costs and safety concerns. The protests came amid general pessimism in the sector, as French nuclear energy giant EDF is set to produce the lowest amount of atomic power in three decades due to powerplant shutdowns, while its flagship reactor is years behind schedule and over budget. </td>

However, safety remains his number one priority: "If a new variant came along or something changed and the rules had to be revisited, I for one would understand that." , Mr Shapps also confirmed that from 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England will be able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass for international outbound travel.                                                                                                          , It comes after families have struggled to prove their children's vaccination status when trying to enter countries including Spain, Italy and France.                                                                                                                                            , Mr Shapps also told MPs the UK is set to recognise vaccine certificates from 16 further nations, including countries like China and Mexico.                                                                                                                                                      , This will take the total number of recognised countries and territories to 180.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The moves were welcomed by the travel and tourism industry, which has been one of the sectors hit hardest by coronavirus lockdown measures.                                                                                                                                                      , Airline Virgin Atlantic said: "The removal of all testing for vaccinated passengers is the final step in moving towards frictionless air travel, allowing passengers to reconnect with loved ones and business colleagues.                                                                       , "It restores customer confidence and demand will be boosted in a critical booking window for the travel industry."                                                                                                                                                                               , Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, said the airline would "now look ahead to what we believe will be a strong summer".                                                                                                                                                                  , He said: "It is clear travel restrictions did not materially slow the spread of Omicron in the UK and so it is important that there are no more knee jerk reactions to future variants."                                                                                                         , However, the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation, the trade body for the industry, warned rules had been lifted too quickly.                                                                                                                                                            , Its chairman Tom Watson said: "We have consistently backed relaxing unnecessary restrictions, but the only way that our country can avoid hard lockdowns is by maintaining a robust Covid testing regime to quickly discover new variants."                                                      , Currently, fully vaccinated passengers, who have had two doses (or one dose of the Janssen vaccine), and under-18s no longer need a pre-departure test two days before travelling to the UK.                                                                                                     , However, within 48 hours of arrival, everyone aged five and over -  or 11 and over in Scotland - must take a lateral flow test (LFT), or a more expensive PCR test.                                                                                                                              , If they take an LFT and it is positive, they must self-isolate and take an NHS PCR test to confirm the result.                                                                                                                                                                                   , Vaccinated travellers also have to fill in and submit an online passenger locator form no more than 48 hours before arriving, even if they are just passing through the UK.                                                                                                                      , But Mr Shapps said the form, which had been "complex and difficult to navigate", would now be made simpler and travellers would have an extra day to fill it in.                                                                                                                                 , Earlier in January, the government scrapped the need for fully vaccinated travellers coming to England to take a Covid test before they travel.                                                                                                                                                  , However, arrivals who are not fully vaccinated must take a pre-departure test and two post-arrival PCR tests, which are more expensive than the lateral flow version.                                                                                                                            , They must also self-isolate for 10 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Are your journey plans affected by the removal of Covid travel tests in England?

That's not enough for the Fed to go with a weak backbone. They have to show some credibility on inflation here," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Advisory Group. "By kowtowing to the market so quickly without doing anything with respect to inflation would be a bad look for them."                                                                                            , Over the past two months the Fed has taken a sharp pivot on inflation, which is running at a nearly 40-year high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Central bank officials spent most of 2021 calling the rapid price increases "transitory" and pledging to keep short-term borrowing rates anchored near zero until they saw full employment. But with inflation more durable and intense than Fed forecasts, policymakers have indicated they will start hiking interest rates in March and tightening policy elsewhere.                                                                , Where the market had been able to count on the Fed to step in with policy easing during previous corrections, a Fed committed to fighting inflation is considered unlikely to step in and stem the bleeding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "That gets into the circular nature of monetary policy. It gooses asset prices when they are pedal to the metal, and asset prices fall when they back off," Boockvar said. "The difference this time is they have rates at zero and inflation is at 7%.

Fears of a global economic slowdown in the face of a tightening Fed led to the market's worst Christmas Eve rout in history that year, and the following year saw multiple rate cuts to assuage nervous investors.                                                                                                            , There are differences aside from inflation between this time and that market washout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , DataTrek Research compared December 2018 with January 2022 and found some key differences:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "By any measure as the Fed looks to assess capital markets stress ... we are nowhere near the same point as in 2018 where the central bank reconsidered its monetary policy stance," DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas wrote in his daily note.                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Put another way: until we get a further selloff in risk assets, the Fed will simply not be convinced that raising interest rates and reducing the size of its balance sheet in 2022 will more likely cause a recession rather than a soft landing," he added.                                                                                                                                                                         , But Monday's market action added to the rough waters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Major averages dipped more than 2% by midday, with rate-sensitive tech stocks on the Nasdaq taking the worst of it, down more than 4%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Market veteran Art Cashin said he thinks the Fed could take notice of the recent selling and move off its tightening position if the carnage continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "The Fed is very nervous about these things. It might give them a reason to slow their step a little bit," Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, said Monday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "I don't think they want to be too overt about it. But believe me, I think they will have the market's back if things turn worse, if we don't bottom here and turn around and they keep selling into late spring, early summer.", Still, Bank of America strategists and economists said in a joint note Monday that the Fed is unlikely to budge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The bank said it expects Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday to signal that "every meeting is live" regarding either rate hikes or additional tightening measures. Markets already are pricing in at least four increases this year, and Goldman Sachs said the Fed could hike at every meeting starting in March if inflation doesn't subside.                                                                                    , While the Fed isn't likely to set concrete plans, both Bank of America and Goldman Sachs see the central bank nodding toward the end of its asset purchases in the next month or two and an outright rundown of the balance sheet to start around midyear.                                                                                                                                                                             , Though markets have expected the asset purchase taper to come to a complete conclusion in March, BofA said there's a chance that the quantitative easing program might be halted in January or February. That in turn could send an important signal on rates.                                                                                                                                                                         , "We believe this would surprise the market and likely signal an even more hawkish turn than already expected," the bank's research team said in a note. "Announced taper conclusion at this meeting would increase the odds we assign to a 50bp hike in March and another potentially 50bp hike in May."                                                                                                                               , Markets already have priced in four quarter-percentage point increases this year and had been leaning toward a fifth before reducing those odds Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The note further went on to say that a market worried about inflation "will likely continue bullying the Fed into more rate hikes this year, and we expect limited pushback from Powell."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Boockvar said the situation is the result of a failed "flexible average inflation targeting" Fed policy adopted in 2020 that prioritized jobs over inflation, the pace of which has garnered comparisons with the late 1970s and early 1980s at a time of easy central bank policy.                                                                                                                                                    , "They can't print jobs, so they're not going to get restaurants to hire people," he said. "So this whole idea that the Fed can somehow influence jobs is specious in the short term for sure. There's a lot of lost lessons here from the 1970s."                                                                                                                                                                                      , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Kazakhstan Producer Price Inflation Moderates </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Kazakhstan’s annual producer price inflation eased to 46.1 percent in December of 2021, from a five-month high of 48.5 percent jump in November, amid low base year effects and rising global commodity prices amid ongoing supply chain issues. Prices rose the most in mining &amp; quarrying (67.5 percent vs 73.1 percent in November); followed by manufacturing industries (23.0 percent vs 23.1 percent); electricity, gas, steam &amp; air conditioning supply (11.9 percent vs 11.7 percent); and lastly water supply &amp; sewerage cost (2.5 percent vs 2.7 percent). On a monthly basis, producer prices increased 0.8 percent, slowing sharply from a 5.5 percent jump in November. For the year, producer prices surged 32.1 percent over the previous year, compared with a 4.2 percent decline in 2020. </td>

I think it's a very dangerous idea to uphold," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The market sell-off accelerated Monday, with the Dow dropping as much as 1,100 points, as investors braced for a potential hawkish tilt from the Federal Reserve this week. The S&amp;P 500 also dipped into correction territory, falling more than 10% from its record high.                                                                                                    , The Fed will wrap up its policy meeting on Wednesday. Central bankers have indicated that they expect not only to raise rates and taper asset purchases soon — but also could be teeing up a balance sheet reduction. The potential move from the Fed would mark an aggressive policy change after nearly two years of the most accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history., The central bank last raised rates in late 2018, part of a "normalization" process that happened in the waning period of the record-long economic expansion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Chanos called the 2018 rate hike "a big error" from the Fed, which caused a significant sell-off in the stock market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The longtime investor said despite the sharp decline in stocks recently, his hedge fund is still slightly net long on the market. He added that investors should avoid names with high-flying multiples.                                                                                                                                                                      , Chanos, the founder of Kynikos Associates, is a famed short seller on Wall Street with a long history of identifying fraud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Got a confidential news tip?

Still, the yield’s downturn was curbed by growing expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia will begin raising interest rates in the first half of the year and end its quantitative easing as soon as February. The case for a more hawkish RBA strengthened after Australia’s jobless rate fell to a 13-year low of 4.2% last December, with traders now eyeing the fourth quarter inflation report to confirm their rate hike bets, despite Governor Lowe stating rate hikes wouldn’t come before 2023. </td>

       components that are losing ground. The stock's $17.27 price decline, which is the stock's second-biggest-ever price decline behind the $23.41 record selloff on March 16, 2020, was slashing about 114 points off the Dow's price, while the Dow dropped 1,002 points, or 2.9%. Microsoft's stock is now trading 18.8% below its Nov. 19 record close of $343.11. Many on Wall Street define a bear market as a decline of 20% or more from a bull-market high. By that definition, a close below $274.49 would put the stock in a bear market.

Currently 312, or 62%, of the S&amp;P 500 are trading below their 200-day moving average (DMA), which many on Wall Street view as a dividing line between longer-term uptrends and downtrends, according to FactSet data. That's the highest percentage of S&amp;P 500 stock's below their 200-DMA since July 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. In addition, there are 185 stocks, or 37%, in which the 50-DMA -- a shorter-term trend tracker -- is trading below the 200-day moving average, which many feel suggests a longer-term technical downtrend is in place. Also, 184 stocks, or 36%, are trading more than 20% below their 52-week highs, which for FactSet is the highest intraday trading price seen in the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is 3.7% below its 200-day moving average; the 50-DMA is at 4,658.30, or still well above its 20-DMA at 4,429.92; and the index is about 11.5% below its 52-week high., Stock benchmarks on Monday head significantly lower, as investors brace for a Federal Reserve gathering early this week that could set the tone for the rest of 2022.

On Saturday, the nation registered a record 54,411 infections, which is resulting in thousands of people self-isolating at home and driving labor shortages in many firms. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Brazilian Real traded near 5.5, the lowest since January 18th, as negative risk sentiment was driving the dollar higher. Investors are preparing for the US central bank meeting later this week, in which the Fed is expected to outline a more hawkish stance amid rising inflation. Also, the tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine showed almost no signs of abating prompting investors to look for safe-heaven. Domestically, President Jair Bolsonaro signed the 2022 budget into law, which predicts that the Brazilian economy will grow 2.1% in 2022, with total expenses seen at 4.7 trillion reais, of which 1.8 billion reais will be used to refinance public debt. The budget law also allocates 89.1 billion reais to the Auxílio Brasil program, 4.9 billion reais to the electoral fund, and 1.7 billion reais for the readjustment of federal civil servants throughout 2022. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Mexican peso traded above 2.6 per USD, the lowest since December 28th, as negative risk sentiment was driving the dollar higher. Investors are preparing for the US central bank meeting later this week, in which the Fed is expected to bring forward its tightening plans. Also, the tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine showed almost no signs of abating prompting investors to look for safe-heaven. Domestically, preliminary data showed that the economy likely contracted 0.2% in December, suggesting a sluggish performance in the final quarter of last year. At the same time, JP Morgan said in a recent report, the Mexican economy is facing a potential credit rating downgrade in the medium term due to political developments, including the likely passage of controversial energy bill. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Pakistan Holds Key Rate Steady </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The State Bank of Pakistan left its key policy rate unchanged at 9.75% on January 24th of 2022, citing no more monetary tightening was needed due to the government's fiscal policy. The central bank Governor added that the mid-year budget passed earlier in the month and the end of exemptions on sales tax would translate in a smaller fiscal deficit and soften demand, ultimately easing the momentum of inflation to a more sustainable pace. Still, the central bank said high inflation rates will linger in the near-term due to rising global commodity prices. Policymakers also expected the non-oil current account to reach a surplus in FY22, while the overall current account deficit seemed to have stabilized since November. Looking ahead, the annual inflation rate is forecasted to hover the upper limit of the 9%-11% range target in FY22 and to ease to 5%-7% in FY23, while new GDP projections see FY22 growth at 4.5% from a prior estimate of 5.0%. </td>

The Fed is set to raise the fed funds rate in March and reduce the balance sheet later this year although the size of the rate hike is still uncertain. Also, the tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine showed almost no signs of abating prompting investors to look for safe-heaven.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Dow ends higher after dramatic selloff - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN Business)On a wild day on Wall Street, stocks ended the day higher with a stunning turnaround just before the closing bell. Stocks began the day with a dramatic selloff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , US stocks opened in the red as investors worried about the Federal Reserve's plans to hike interest rates, tensions in Ukraine, earnings season and — of course — inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , At the low point of the session, the market was on track for its worst day since October 2020, with the Dow down more than 1,000 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But with just minutes to go in the trading session, the major indexes reversed course and turned green. The Dow finished 0.3%, or 99 points, higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , What on earth happened to turn things around? The selloff may have just gone a bit too far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "Investors may have gotten a bit too pessimistic about the growth outlook," said Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya in the late afternoon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The S&amp;P 500 (SPX), the broadest measure of the US equities market, also ended up 0.3%. During the session, the index had been on track to fall into correction. But it wasn't meant to be, at least not on Monday: Last week, it logged its worst week since March 2020.                                                                                                                                                         , The Nasdaq Composite (COMP), which entered correction territory last week, closed up 0.6%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The wild swings of the day were also visible in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), or Vix, which soared during the day but ended the session "only" 3.2% higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , CNN's Fear &amp; Greed Index still flashed fear Monday afternoon, but the level was slightly less severe than on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Each day last week, stocks fared worse in the final hour of trading, which tends to be a bad sign for the next day, said TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "After a tough start for stocks in 2022, investors are looking for reasons to expect a rebound," said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "After more than doubling off the pandemic lows in March 2020, without anything more than a 5% pullback in 2021, stocks probably needed a break," he added. "That doesn't, however, make this dip feel much more comfortable."                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A lot to digest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Investors also have a lot on their plate this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Earnings season has moved on to Big Tech, including Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC) and Apple (AAPL), which report results this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Then there's the Fed meeting, concluding with Wednesday's policy statement and subsequent press conference. As of Monday morning, market expectations for this week are that the central bank will keep interest rates near zero for a little longer, according to the CME FedWatch tool. But for the next meeting, which isn't until March, expectations of a quarter-percentage-point rate hike were near 90% Monday afternoon., Expectations are only part of the game. The Fed could also conclude that inflation has run too hot at the end of 2021 and crank up rates more — or sooner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Treasury yields, which track interest rate expectations, were off last week's highs Monday but inched higher in the late afternoon. The 10-year bond yielded 1.76% around the time of the close after climbing past 1.8% for the first time since before the pandemic last week.                                                                                                                                                 , While the Fed is trying to get inflation down by normalizing its pandemic-era policies, the US economy is grappling with the fallout from the Omicron variant. America's private sector output growth slowed in January as the highly infectious variant put more pressure on the already-battered supply chain and existing labor shortage, according to the IHS Markit flash composite purchasing managers' index.             , Making matters worse, investors are anxiously watching the situation in Ukraine as fears mount that the country could be invaded by Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The news that the United States and United Kingdom are withdrawing some staff from the local embassies isn't exactly breeding confidence the situation will resolve quickly and European stock markets are sharply lower as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                , Commodities markets are feeling the pressure of the rising tensions and analysts believe oil prices could soar if the situation escalated.

The market jitters revolved around the highly anticipated US Fed monetary policy meeting later this week and growing tensions between the US and Russia over Ukraine.

After talks between Russia and NATO members failed to lower tension, imminent military activity at the Russia-Ukraine border led the US and the UK to remove embassy staff from Kyiv. At the same time, investors monitor the possible implementation of sanctions imposed on Russia and its repercussions with EU trade, particularly for energy. Elsewhere, the Bank of France estimated that the economy grew by 0.6% quarterly during Q4 of 2021, remaining on track of its recovery plans despite the surge of the Omicron variant during December. The Bank's Governor Francois de Galhau noted the French economy should grow 3.6% in 2022, while French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire stated the spread of the Omicron variant would not interrupt growth. </td>

That was the highest inflation rate since February of 2012, driven by surging prices of food (41.6 percent vs 28.9 percent in November) amid a civil war in the Northern region and increased demand due to the festive season.

The latest reading pointed to the weakest pace of expansion in the service sector since July 2020, on the back of labor shortages, employee absences and the Omicron wave. New business growth softened to a four-month low, while employment rose at a modest pace and backlogs of work increased the least since May. On the price front, the increase in input costs was the joint-softest for almost a year despite being marked overall, while the rate of charge inflation accelerated to a series high. Finally, business confidence slipped to a three-month low amid concerns regarding the impact of inflation and the pandemic on demand over the coming months. </td>

But its economic disruptions have made a postpandemic normal ever more elusive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Forecasters have slashed their estimates for economic growth in the first three months of 2022. Some expect January to show the first monthly decline in employment in more than a year. And retail sales and manufacturing production fell in December, suggesting that the impact began well before cases hit their peak.                                                                                                                                     , “Those are Omicron’s fingerprints,” said Constance L. Hunter, chief economist for the accounting firm KPMG. “It will slow growth in the beginning of the first quarter.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , On Monday, global markets were in a frenzy, with the S&amp;P 500 plunging nearly 4 percent before recovering its losses. Market analysts said the early declines reflected fears that the Federal Reserve might need to respond more aggressively than expected to rapidly rising prices, a prospect that some economists say has been made more likely by Omicron.                                                                                                 , Recovery prospects in the longer run are uncertain. Some economists say even temporary job losses could force consumers to pull back their spending, especially now that federal programs that helped families early in the pandemic have largely ended. Others worry that Omicron could compound supply-chain backlogs both in the United States and overseas, prolonging the recent bout of high inflation and putting pressure on the Fed to act.            , But some see Omicron as the equivalent of a severe winter storm, causing disruptions and delays but ultimately doing little permanent economic damage. The recovery has proved resilient so far, they argue, and has enough underlying momentum to carry it through.                                                                                                                                                                                            , “There are so many potential ways that this could go,” said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University. “We didn’t even agree on where we were going without Omicron, and then you throw Omicron on top.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , More than 8.7 million Americans weren’t working in late December and early January because they had Covid-19 or were caring for someone who did, according to the latest estimate from the Census Bureau’s experimental Household Pulse Survey. Another 5.3 million were taking care of children who were home from school or day care. The cumulative impact is larger than at any other point in the pandemic.                                                , Covid-related absences are creating headaches for businesses that were struggling to hire workers even before Omicron. Restaurants and retail stores have cut back hours. Broadway shows called off performances. Airlines canceled thousands of flights over the holidays because so many crew members called in sick; on one day last month, nearly a third of United Airlines workers at Newark Liberty International Airport, a major hub, called in sick.  , At Designer Paws Salon, a pet grooming company with two locations in the Columbus, Ohio, area, business has been strong in recent months, thanks in part to a pandemic boom in pet ownership. But Misty Gieczys, the company’s founder and chief executive, has been struggling to fill 11 positions despite generous benefits and pay that can reach $95,000 a year in commissions and tips.                                                                   , Omicron has only made things worse, she said. Since Christmas, she has received only three job applications, and just one applicant got back to her after she reached out. Then Ms. Gieczys, who has two young daughters, got Covid-19 herself for the second time, forcing her to stay home. That, on top of day care shutdowns because of the virus, has meant she has spent a significant amount of time away from work.                                     , “If I wasn’t the owner, I think I would be fired, honestly,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But while the Omicron wave has contributed to businesses’ staffing woes, there is little sign so far that it has set back the job market recovery more generally. New filings for unemployment insurance have risen only modestly in recent weeks, suggesting that employers are holding on to their workers. Job postings on the career site Indeed have edged down only slightly from record highs.                                                           , “It’s a vast difference from 2020, where there were mass layoffs,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who was an adviser to President Barack Obama. “Now employers are holding on to people because they expect to be in business in a month.”                                                                                                                                                                                                              , When the pandemic began in early 2020, it was a shock to both supply and demand, as companies and their customers pulled back in the face of the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , With each successive wave, however, the impact on demand has gotten smaller. Businesses and consumers learned to adapt. Federal aid helped prop up people’s income. And more recently, the availability of vaccines and improved treatment options have made many people comfortable resuming more normal activities.                                                                                                                                           , Supply problems have been slower to dissipate, and in some cases have gotten worse as production and shipping backlogs have grown. If Omicron follows the same pattern, limiting the supply of goods and workers while doing little to dent consumers’ willingness to spend, it could lead to faster inflation.                                                                                                                                                 , “What should happen is the supply shock should be much larger than the demand shock,” said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America. “All of that just means more inflation.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But Omicron’s impact on inflation is not straightforward. Retail sales fell 1.9 percent in December, and restaurant reservations on OpenTable have fallen in January. That suggests that the record-breaking number of coronavirus cases is having an effect on demand, even if it is more muted than in past waves.                                                                                                                                            , The latest Covid surge is also the first to hit after the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits, the expanded child tax credit and most other emergency federal aid programs. Nearly a quarter of private-sector workers get no paid sick time, meaning that even a temporary absence from work could force them to cut back spending now that government benefits aren’t replacing lost income.                                                         , “That stimulus pay really helped push people past their reticence and say, ‘It’s OK to spend,’” said Nela Richardson, chief economist for ADP, the payroll company. “Now there’s no big push in stimulus, and so people might change their spending behavior.”                                                                                                                                                                                                  , One possibility is that Omicron could reduce inflation in the short term, as consumers pull back spending, but increase it in the longer run, as the virus leads to shutdowns in Asia that could prolong supply-chain disruptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Cozy Earth, a bamboo bedding and clothing company based in Salt Lake City, was poised to start 2022 on a strong note. Then Omicron “just hit the brakes on us,” said Tyler Howells, the company’s founder and president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Over a three-week period, roughly two-thirds of the company’s 50 employees contracted the virus. A group of web developers flew in for a meeting, but one tested positive, so the meeting had to be canceled. A contractor that was producing signs for an upcoming trade show put the order on hold for a few weeks because too many employees were sick. With so many people out sick in early January, Mr. Howells shut down the office for more than a week., Still, the direct damage to Cozy Earth’s business has been manageable, Mr. Howells said. He is more concerned about the subtler toll that each new false dawn takes on his business, and his ability to plan for the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “If it continues, it will be a problem,” he said. “It will create damage to the business in terms of fits and starts.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ms. Sinclair, the George Washington University economist, said the most lasting consequence of the Omicron wave might be the way it had again upended the plans of both businesses and workers. Every time that happens, she said, it increases the risk of permanent damage: Project delays turn into cancellations; expansion plans are abandoned; people who had been thinking about returning to work decide to retire instead.                             , “This piling on of compounding uncertainty is causing further damage,” she said. “This uncertainty is particularly damaging because families aren’t able to make plans, businesses aren’t able to make plans, policymakers aren’t able to make plans.”                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit US Manufacturing PMI fell to 55 in January of 2022 from 56.7 in December, well below forecasts of 56.7, and pointing to the slowest growth in factory activity in 15 months, preliminary estimates showed. Output levels were broadly unchanged, as new order growth slowed to the softest rate since July 2020. Alongside labor and material shortages, firms noted that customers were keen to reduce spending amid sharp hikes in costs. The rate of cost inflation eased again and was the slowest since May 2021 and charge inflation was the least marked since April 2021. Labor shortages, a high turnover of staff and reports of the non-replacement of voluntary leavers led to the first decline in employment since July 2020. Finally, confidence was the highest since November 2020 amid hopes of stable supply flows and a reduction in the impact of COVID-19. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit US Composite PMI slumped to 50.8 in January 2022 from 57.0 in the previous month, signaling the slowest pace of expansion in business activity since July 2020, a preliminary estimate showed. Both manufacturing and service sector firms reported near-stalled output, amid reports of softer demand conditions, worsening supply chain disruptions and labor shortages linked to the Omicron wave. New orders continued to rise strongly, albeit at the weakest rate since December 2020, while export order growth eased due to renewed restrictions in key export markets and raw material shortages. In addition, the rise in employment was only modest, with backlogs of work increasing solidly again. On the price front, input cost inflation softened to the lowest since last March, while the pace of selling price inflation was the third-fastest on record. Finally, business confidence weakened due to concerns regarding further price rises and client responses to inflationary pressures. </td>

Blackstone Real Estate senior managing director Asim Hamid said the transaction "represents a continuation of our high-conviction investing in top-quality multifamily communities in growth markets across the U.S." Shares of Blackstone Group are down 15.2% so far in 2022, compared to a drop of 7.7% by the S&amp;P 500., Here's what the chief executive of ARK Invest had to say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Steve Gelsi covers banking and cannabis as a Senior Reporter for MarketWatch. </td>

Additionally, analysts see the supply and demand balance loosen by 7 to 9 bcfd in the first week of the coming month, as production sites come back online and demand softens. Regarding upside risks, meteorologists said that pockets of colder temperatures in Canada could still make their way south and boost demand in the short-term.

Investors also remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting later this week, at which policymakers are set to keep interest rates unchanged but signal their first interest rate hike in March. Domestically, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro signed the 2022 budget into law, which predicts that the Brazilian economy will grow 2.1% in 2022, with total expenses seen at 4.7 trillion reais, of which 89.1 billion reais to the Auxílio Brasil program, 4.9 billion reais to the electoral fund and 1.7 billion reais for the readjustment of federal civil servants throughout 2022.

Elsewhere, ECB Governing Council member Robert Holzmann said there is a great deal of uncertainty over how long inflation could remain above the central bank’s target of 2%. On the political front, the Italian government started its presidential elections, as multiple MP’s regarded incumbent Prime Minister Mario Draghi as the probable choice.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ex-Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein says 'crypto is happening' despite plunge in digital assets </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Former Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein said his view of cryptocurrencies has evolved after digital assets attracted trillions of dollars in value and a rapidly growing ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                               , On Monday, Blankfein was asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on "Squawk Box" for his view on the nascent asset class, who noted that the former banker has voiced skepticism in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                        , "Look, my view of it is evolving," Blankfein said. "I can't predict the future, but I think it's a big thing to be able to predict the present, like, 'What is happening?' And I look at the crypto, and it is happening."                                                                                                                                                      , By "happening," Blankfein means the ecosystem around cryptocurrencies has matured in the past year, he explained. Traditional financial companies including Goldman have begun offering clients ways to buy, trade and custody digital currencies, and a parallel universe of decentralized finance protocols has emerged so holders can lend out and earn yield on their coins., Cryptocurrencies have been selling off for weeks as expectations of rising interest rates hit riskier assets. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies fell below $2 trillion last week after reaching a high of $3.1 trillion in November.                                                                                                                                     , "It's lost a lot of value, but at a point where it's trillions of dollars of value contributing to it and whole ecosystems are growing around it," he said. "Of course, we have the benefits of instantaneous transfer and reduction of credit risk and all the benefits of blockchain."                                                                                        , In the past, Blankfein has criticized bitcoin as a store of value and said that regulators should be "hyperventilating" over its rise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "I may be skeptical, but I'm also pragmatic about it," Blankfein said Monday. "And so guess what? I would certainly want to have an oar in that water."                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In the wide-ranging interview, Blankfein discussed how uncertainty over inflation has caused bearishness throughout markets in recent weeks. He also said that banks trade at an "unbelievably low multiple" and that some of the best investments are made in declining markets.                                                                                               , Got a confidential news tip?

Brazil's food supply agency Conab estimated the production of arabica coffee at 38.78 million bags, 23% more than in 2021. The agency said, however, that world coffee stocks would fall in 2021/22, keeping prices high even though production in Brazil is poised to rise. Also, persistent shipping bottleneck caused by the spreading pandemic, higher costs of fertilizers and fuels and ongoing labor shortages should continue to exert upward pressure on coffee prices. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> EU natural gas prices briefly hit an over 1-week high of €94.85 before capping gains at €92 per megawatt-hour on Monday afternoon, amid mounting concerns about Russian supplies. Goldman Sachs analysts said natural gas imports to Europe could be stopped indefinitely if the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is hit by sanctions, while escalating tensions could drive the risk premium higher and push gas prices to new record highs. As of Monday, Western leaders have reiterated warnings of a harsh response to a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with the German Chancellor adding he was ready to discuss halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. However, the Chancellor also called for prudency, given the dramatically low storage levels of natural gas that haunts Germany. Meanwhile, the European Commission was discussing with partners, namely Azerbaijan and the US, ways of boosting natural gas supplies to the bloc. Elsewhere, Asian nations are expected to attract more LNG cargoes due to colder weather. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures fell below $83 a barrel on Monday as a stronger dollar was enough to offset the possibility of supply disruptions. The dollar index strengthened to a 2-week high above 96 on Monday amid a flight to safety due to increasing tensions between the US and Russia over Ukraine and the possibility of a more hawkish stance from the Fed. Meanwhile, the UAE defense ministry said it destroyed two Yemen's Houthi ballistic missiles targeting the country after a drone attack hit an oil facility and airport in Abu Dhabi last week. Also, the International Energy Agency said last week that the OPEC+ missed its production targets by 790,000 bpd in December as members like West African producers Nigeria and Angola struggled to raise output. </td>

before it bounced back and ended with a slight gain.



                                                               , The S&amp;P 500 ended with a 0.3 percent gain, but not before plunging to a point where it was more than 10 percent below its Jan. 3 record. That kind of drop, called a correction, doesn’t happen often, and is a marker of investors’ souring attitudes toward stocks. The last time the S&amp;P 500 was in a correction was March 2020, when fear over the emerging coronavirus pandemic gripped global markets.                                                                                                                                                                                         , It’s no coincidence that the wild day came just before the Federal Reserve begins its first policy meeting of the year on Tuesday, a two-day event that ends with a statement and news conference on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The central bank is widely expected to begin raising interest rates in March, and to do so again several times this year, as it looks to combat fast rising consumer prices. Investors are on edge, afraid interest rates could climb too quickly, hurting corporate profits, dampening consumer demand, and — in a worst-case scenario — tipping the economy into a recession. Some of the selling on Monday was set off by fear that the Fed might surprise markets on Wednesday.                                                                                                                  , “The sell-off was overdone and it had to do more with a panicky decline than it had to do with any rational adjustment to economic or Fed expectations,” said John Canavan, an analyst at Oxford Economics. While there probably won’t be any significant changes in the central bank’s policy this week, the attention on the meeting “focuses markets on the broader fact that the Fed is prepared to aggressively remove accommodation they hadn’t expected just a few months ago,” Mr. Canavan said.                                                                                             , The Fed slashed its main policy interest rate, the federal funds rate, to near-zero in 2020 as the central bank took extraordinary measures to shore up the economy after coronavirus lockdowns were put in place. Those low rates also helped fuel a huge rally in stock prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Now that the central bank is likely to unwind those measures, investors are rethinking their expectations for corporate profits, which might be crimped as heavily indebted companies pay more to borrow. They’re also reconsidering what they’re willing to pay for stocks. When interest rates rise, higher borrowing costs for houses and cars could also slow consumer spending, a pillar of the American economy.                                                                                                                                                                               , The Fed could raise its benchmark rate — most likely by a quarter of a percentage point — as soon as March, economists expect, with some investors predicting three more increases this year. That would put the benchmark rate at 1 percent by the end of 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But investors who are worried the Fed will be more aggressive also may have gotten carried away on Monday, said Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior U.S. rates strategist at T.D. Securities, who noted that some were discussing outcomes that the Fed hadn’t suggested, like a large rate increase in March or the possibility that it will raise interest rates each time it meets after this week, until inflation is under control.                                                                                                                                                                     , Spilling over into financial markets are concerns about tension between Russia and Ukraine, with European stock benchmarks falling sharply on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The White House is considering deploying thousands of U.S. troops, as well as warships and aircraft, to NATO allies in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, in what would be a major shift from its restrained stance on Ukraine. On Sunday, the State Department ordered all family members of U.S. embassy personnel in Kyiv to leave Ukraine, citing the threat of Russian military action.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Heightened tension in the region threatens Europe’s energy supply, because Russia provides the continent with more than 40 percent of its natural gas and 25 percent of its oil. Europe is already coping with soaring natural gas prices caused by short supplies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , With Europe also struggling to contain inflation, which is already being driven higher by energy prices, “this could be a serious problem for the eurozone economy,” said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index in London.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The Stoxx Europe 600 and the DAX index in Germany both slid 3.8 percent on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , As sudden as this month’s drop in stock prices has been, it follows an unceasing run-up that had started to unnerve some investors. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 27 percent in 2021 — its third consecutive year of gains — and even after its drop so far in January the stock index is still about twice where it stood at its lowest point in March 2020, before the Fed first stepped in to bolster the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Those gains continued late last year even as prices for food and gas climbed at a pace not seen in years, along with wages, and despite the overhang of the coronavirus pandemic. Speculators had also turned to investments as varied as cryptocurrencies, real estate and even trading cards and other collectibles, something that had alarmed many who saw signs that investors were getting carried away.                                                                                                                                                                                       , So a slide in prices that removes some of that excess was long overdue, many market watchers said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “We haven’t had a correction in a long time,” said Lindsey Bell, the chief money and markets strategist at Ally Invest. “While this sell-off in the past couple of weeks feels uncomfortable, the good news is that, the sooner you have a sell-off or correction like we’re seeing today, the earlier and the more likely you are to make up that lost ground before year-end.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , That doesn’t mean it won’t be a bumpy year for stock investors. Growth in corporate profits is likely to slow, in particular among large technology stocks, and many companies championed by investors during the pandemic, like Peloton and Netflix, have tumbled as a return to normal means they lose momentum with new customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , But some investors are concerned that even the largest tech companies may be faltering, something that will be exacerbated if interest rates climb — forcing them to dedicate more of their profits to debt payments, and also making it harder to achieve investors’ high expectations for growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Technology stocks, which have been on the leading edge of the market decline this year, were also walloped on Monday: The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid about 5 percent, before it rallied back to end the day with a gain of about 0.6 percent. The Nasdaq had already crossed the correction threshold last week and is now down 13.7 percent from its high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Microsoft, the next of the big tech companies to report its profits, is expected to say on Tuesday that its bottom line rose 12 percent in the final three months of last year compared with a year ago, a substantial slowdown from its previous quarter, which was its most profitable ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , More broadly, earnings from tech companies are expected to have risen nearly 15 percent in the fourth quarter. That’s down from full-year growth of nearly 28 percent, according to the market research firm FactSet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “The return to normalization that we will see this year will include more moderate growth and higher interest rates,” said Ryan Jacob, the portfolio manager of the Jacob Internet Fund. “That’s a difficult environment for large-cap tech.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Jeanna Smialek, Jeff Sommer and Stephen Gandel contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , After rising through much of the pandemic, the stock market has tumbled in recent weeks. On Monday, the sell-off pushed the S&amp;P 500 stock index to the cusp of a correction, a Wall Street term for a significant decline from a recent high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Concerns that the Federal Reserve will move aggressively to remove economic stimulus to fight inflation, fears over armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine and a rethinking of high valuations after a long bull market have all contributed to the rapid reversal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , A correction is a 10 percent drop in stocks from their most recent high. Since its Jan. 3 peak, the S&amp;P 500 had fallen as much as 10 percent in intraday trading on Monday, before recovering from the worst of its losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The 10 percent trigger for a correction is an arbitrary, round-number threshold. But it serves as a signal that investors have turned pointedly more pessimistic about the market. That is particularly the case for technology stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite Index down about 18 percent from its most recent peak, in mid-November.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , If the current decline continues and becomes a correction, it will be the 11th in the S&amp;P 500 since the turn of the century, according to Yardeni Research. Of the 10 corrections so far, three turned into bear markets, defined as a more severe decline of at least 20 percent:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Bear markets are highlighted in red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Source: Yardeni Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Not necessarily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Some corrections don’t last very long, like the one in early 2018, which spanned less than two weeks. Others can be more drawn out, generally when they develop into full-fledged bear markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , That said, the previous bear market, at the start of the pandemic, was severe but relatively short — it erased just about 33 percent in value from stocks in just over a month. Less than three months later, stocks had regained their previous peak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , By Stephen Gandel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Technology companies, which for much of the pandemic have been the stock market’s best performers as they have benefited from and enabled remote work, social distancing and online shopping, are nearing a bear market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Half the stocks that make up the Nasdaq 100, an index closely aligned with the largest technology companies, have dropped more than 20 percent from their 52-week highs. The term of art for that on Wall Street is a bear market, signaling a marked shift in sentiment among investors and a decline even more severe than the 10 percent drop known as a correction. Some shares have faired considerably worse.                                                                                                                                                                                  , The worst performer in the index is Peloton, whose exercise bikes have become a status symbol and seemed like must-have items at the start of the pandemic. The company’s stock has plunged 82 percent over the past year despite a gain of nearly 10 percent on Monday. At nearly $30, the share price is back to its prepandemic level and just above the $29 of the stock’s initial public offering in September 2019.                                                                                                                                                                            , Peloton is considering layoffs, and last week it announced that it lost $270 million in the last three months of 2021, compared with a $64 million profit a year earlier. The company had been planning to open a new U.S. factory this year, but now it appears to be scaling back production to work through its inventory of unsold bikes and treadmills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “Peloton is the extreme example of a company where people extrapolated that Covid growth into the future and were way off,” said Ryan Jacob, the portfolio manager of the Jacob Internet Fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Four of the Nasdaq’s five worst performers of the past few months are former pandemic stars: Peloton, Moderna, Zoom and DocuSign, which allows users to sign legal documents remotely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Shares of Moderna, the vaccine maker, hit a high of nearly $500 in August but are down 69 percent since then, falling even as Omicron case counts have surged. Zoom is off 66 percent now that some workers have returned to the office and competition from Google and Microsoft has intensified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Taken together, technology stocks are still clear of bear market territory, though they got within a percentage point on Monday before the market recovered somewhat. The Nasdaq composite index, which is broader than the Nasdaq 100 but is still heavily influenced by the moves of tech stocks, has dropped nearly 14 percent since hitting a high in November.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Other tech companies with shares that are well into a bear market include PayPal, the Chinese e-commerce giant Baidu, the biotech firm Biogen and the dating app maker Match Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Observers say one of the biggest drivers of the drop in tech stocks has been bond yields, which have been rising lately, making risky investments like tech stocks less appealing. And David Mericle, a Goldman Sachs economist, told clients in a note over the weekend to expect the Federal Reserve to tighten the supply of money “at every meeting until the inflation picture changes.”                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Tech stocks, especially companies that are not yet profitable, tend to be particularly sensitive to increases in interest rates, which typically signal an expectation of higher inflation, lowering the value of future earnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “The return to normalization that we will see this year will include more moderate growth and higher interest rates,” said Mr. Jacob of the Jacob Internet Fund. “That’s a difficult environment for large-cap tech.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , But the latest concern among investors is that the profits of even the largest tech companies may be faltering. Shares of Netflix dropped as much as 10 percent after the company warned that its subscriber growth rate would slow sharply in 2022. Microsoft is expected to report on Tuesday that its profits in the final three months of last year rose 12 percent from a year earlier, less than half the increase in the prior quarter. In all, tech company bottom lines are expected to have risen nearly 15 percent in the fourth quarter, down from full-year growth of nearly 28 percent., “A hawkish Fed is seen as the main culprit of tech sell-off, but fundamentals for growth stocks have also weakened,” Savita Subramanian, a strategist at Bank of America, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , By Michael M.

Mr. Doocy called out a question: “Do you think inflation is a political liability in the midterms?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Biden’s patience was low. And the volume was up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “It’s a great asset,” the president said in a sarcastic tone, seemingly to himself. “More inflation. What a stupid son of a bitch.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , It was hardly the first time that harsh language intruded on the typically PG-rated interactions between powerful politicians and reporters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , George W. Bush, while running for president in 2000, was caught on a live microphone using a barnyard epithet to refer to a New York Times reporter. (His running mate, Dick Cheney, was overheard affirming Mr. Bush’s observation: “big time.”)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , During his vice presidency in 2010, Mr. Biden was heard using an expletive to convey to President Barack Obama that the signing of the Affordable Care Act was a big deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , No accident was required for Americans to hear the insults lobbed by former President Donald J. Trump at his interlocutors in the press. Mr. Trump deemed Jim Acosta of CNN “a rude, terrible person,” called Jonathan Karl of ABC “a disgrace,” and said April Ryan, now of TheGrio, was a “loser,” to name but three examples. Among other moments, Mr. Trump once mocked the physical disabilities of a Times reporter to entertain his supporters at a campaign rally.                                                                                                                           , Mr. Doocy is a reliable needler of Mr. Biden, although the president often appears more bemused than bothered by their jousts. The sometimes spiky exchanges between the men have become a regular feature of Mr. Biden’s public appearances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , On Monday, Mr. Doocy shouted his question after Mr. Biden finished brief remarks at the start of a cabinet meeting focused on increasing the country’s economic competitiveness. When another journalist yelled out a query about Ukraine, Mr. Biden briefly complained that the reporters should ask questions about the topic at hand rather than about unrelated foreign policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Mr. Doocy, who along with the rest of the press corps was being led out of the room by White House staff members, pivoted to an economic query. Mr. Biden, who was still seated, appeared not to realize that the microphone in front of him was still broadcasting audio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Speaking afterward on Fox News, Mr. Doocy recounted what happened with a lopsided grin. “I couldn’t even hear him because people were shouting at us to get out,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Dana Perino, a Fox News host who served as White House press secretary under Mr. Bush, told Mr. Doocy that he should embrace the moment. “You might even have a book title,” she joked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Last week, at another White House event, Mr. Biden expressed frustration with another Fox News reporter, Jacqui Heinrich, who had shouted out a question about the president’s approach to the tensions between Russia and Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “Why are you waiting on Putin to make the first move, sir?” Ms. Heinrich asked. Mr. Biden quietly replied: “What a stupid question.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Michael D.

Inflation is high, the pandemic continues to keep some workers sidelined and fiscal stimulus has run its course. That has made tax refunds even more important for some families than in normal years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The I.R.S., which has seen its budget steadily slashed by Republican lawmakers over the past several years, had been struggling to keep up with its workload even before the pandemic hit. President Biden proposed investing $80 billion in the I.R.S. over the next decade, but Democrats have so far failed to pass legislation that would approve such spending, and the agency has warned it will struggle as 160 million tax returns are filed in the coming weeks.                                                                                                                            , “This could be a very frustrating tax season for both taxpayers and tax professionals,” Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, told reporters on Monday. “For too long the I.R.S. has suffered too few resources to give the American people the service that they deserve.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , A problematic tax season is the latest obstacle for the Biden administration, which is also grappling with rising prices, clogged supply chains, a stalled economic agenda and the possibility that Russia will invade Ukraine. The tax snafus could further dent Mr. Biden’s poll numbers ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Mr. Rettig warned lawmakers on Monday about the difficulties facing the I.R.S. in a meeting with members of the House Ways and Means Committee, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Joined by Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, and other Treasury and I.R.S. officials, Mr. Rettig said the agency was working to ensure that families would get the remainder of their child tax credit payments in a timely way. He said he was also trying to get the backlog of unprocessed tax returns back to normal levels by the end of the year.                                  , The national taxpayer advocate said in a report this month that the I.R.S. was facing a backlog of at least 10 million unprocessed returns from last year. Since 2010, the I.R.S.’s staffing is down 17 percent, according to the report. Its workload, measured by the number of individual returns, is up 19 percent from 2010 — to 169 million returns last year, from 142 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Refunds associated with some of those unprocessed 2020 returns have also been delayed, and Mr. Retting told reporters on Monday that the I.R.S. was taking an “all hands on deck” approach to work through the backlog as quickly as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Republicans seized on the dysfunction at the I.R.S., arguing that Democrats want to invest in ramping up enforcement at the agency rather than customer service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Although the I.R.S. is facing a historically long backlog of tax filings, President Biden and congressional Democrats have failed to allocate even a dime to help taxpayers this tax filing season,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. “The painful backlog and customer service failures at the agency have become yet another crisis for hardworking American taxpayers.”                                                                                                                                                       , The agency’s already thin resources have been stretched by the demands of distributing funds related to pandemic relief programs such as economic impact payments and the child tax credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , These programs will also add to complications for taxpayers. The I.R.S. said on Monday that taxpayers would need to take extra care when filing their returns to make sure that they correctly conveyed the amounts that they had received. Adding to the confusion, some recipients of the child tax credit have received letters from the I.R.S. with the incorrect totals. I.R.S. officials acknowledged that the agency had received questions about discrepancies and urged taxpayers to crosscheck their letters with their I.R.S. accounts online.                                            , Tax Day is April 18 this year, and Mr. Rettig urged taxpayers to file online and to supply direct deposit information to receive refunds as promptly as possible. He suggested that taxpayers use the agency’s online resources to answer their questions because the agency does not have enough staff to reliably answer the telephones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Understand that we are trying, and our employees are trying,” Mr. Rettig said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , By Cecilia Kang                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The District of Columbia and three states sued Google on Monday, claiming that the tech giant deceived consumers to gain access to their location data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In separate lawsuits, the attorneys general of the district, Texas, Washington and Indiana claimed that Google misled users of Android phones and of tools like Google Maps and its search engine by continuing to track location information of users who had changed privacy settings to prevent the data collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Karl A. Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, led the complaints after a three-year investigation, which was initiated after a report by The Associated Press showed that the company recorded users’ movements even when told not to. He said investigators had found that since at least 2014, Google made misleading and conflicting claims to consumers about privacy protections offered via its account settings.                                                                                                                                                         , The District of Columbia lawsuit alleged that even after users changed the settings in their account or device to stop location tracking, Google collected and stored that information through Google services, Wi-Fi data and marketing partners. The search giant also misled and pressured users to enable more location tracking, for example by claiming products would not function properly if the location services setting was disabled when in fact it was not needed to use the app, according to the suit.                                                                               , “Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access,” Mr. Racine said in a statement. “The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Google said that the allegations brought by the attorneys general were false and that it had put in place many changes to its privacy policies to help users protect their location data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “The attorneys general are bringing a case based on inaccurate claims and outdated assertions about our settings,” said Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google. “We have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Google is also fighting an antitrust lawsuit led by Texas in which states have accused the company of obtaining and abusing a monopoly over the systems that allow publishers to auction off ad space to marketers. On Friday, Google asked a federal court to dismiss the lawsuit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The lawsuits add to a mounting offensive by regulators to curtail the power and business practices of Silicon Valley giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. State and federal regulators have filed dozens of antitrust, consumer protection, privacy and trade lawsuits in an attempt to curb the business models or break up the companies. A Senate committee last week advanced potentially landmark antitrust legislation that tries to weaken the dominance of the internet giants.                                                                                                   , Mr. Racine and the attorneys general of Texas, Washington and Indiana said their suits, filed under local consumer protection laws, sought to fine Google and to stop its practice of collecting location data collection for users who have opted out. The attorneys general also have joined in other antitrust lawsuits against Google for allegedly harming competition in search and advertising technology.                                                                                                                                                                                    , “Google has prioritized profits over people,” The Indiana attorney general, Todd Rokita, said. “It has prioritized financial earnings over following the law.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , By Lauren Hirsch and Michael J. de la Merced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , When a company’s stock starts to drag, activist investors often swoop in to shake things up, pressuring the laggard to cut costs, shed poorly performing assets or even consider selling itself altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Sensing opportunity for investment profits at a time when the stock market has been rocky, activists have taken aim at their latest targets: the multinational consumer goods company Unilever, the fitness equipment maker Peloton and the department store chain Kohl’s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Shares in Unilever rose more than 6 percent on Monday on the revelation that Trian Fund Management, the investment firm founded by Nelson Peltz, has amassed a stake in the consumer products giant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The emergence of Mr. Peltz in Unilever’s stock, previously confirmed by people briefed on the matter, poses another challenge for the company, days after it was forced to drop its $68 billion takeover bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer health business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , It is unclear how much of a stake Trian owns or what it is calling for. But Mr. Peltz is one of Wall Street’s most prominent activist investors, who has successfully pushed for change at consumer goods companies like Mondelez and Procter &amp; Gamble. His successful battle to win a seat on Procter &amp; Gamble’s board in 2017 was the costliest such fight on record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Shareholders and analysts appear to be hoping that Trian will prod Unilever into selling lower-growth brands, something that Mr. Peltz has pushed companies to do in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But others warned that even Mr. Peltz may not be able to improve the company’s fortunes anytime soon. “The changes required to culture and structure will take time and may fail, as they have done previously,” Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote to clients on Monday. “Unilever stock is likely to be an emotional trading stock for years.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In a letter to the embattled at-home fitness equipment maker, Blackwells Capital called for directors to fire the company’s chief executive, John Foley, who is also a co-founder, and to weigh a sale as its shares tumble amid falling sales and growing inventory. Peloton said last week it was considering layoffs and “resetting” its production levels for “sustainable growth.” The stationary bike company initially had to ramp up production to meet pandemic demand — and has now found itself with excess inventory as more people head outdoors for their fitness.                     , Peloton is “on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic,” Blackwells wrote. “With high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Shares of Peloton have tumbled more than 80 percent over the past year, giving it a market capitalization of a little over $9 billion. Shares were up more than 4 percent in morning trading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Still, any fight might be an uphill battle: Peloton has two shares of stock, where Class B shareholders have drastically more voting power — and Mr. Foley alone controls nearly 40 percent of shareholder votes. A representative for Peloton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The retailer Kohl’s has received a roughly $9 billion offer to go private in a deal with an investment consortium backed by the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, according to two people familiar with the matter. The private equity firm Sycamore Partners has also reached out to Kohl’s about a potential deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Kohl’s confirmed on Monday that it had “received letters expressing interest in acquiring” the company. Its shares are up more than 30 percent in early trading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Kohl’s is already under pressure to improve its share price. The activist firm Macellum Advisors, which has a 5 percent stake in Kohl’s, urged the retailer in a letter last Tuesday to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale. That move came after Macellum raised similar criticisms over Kohl’s stock performance last year. The hedge fund Engine Capital has also been calling on Kohl’s to consider a sale, along with other strategic initiatives.                                                                                                                                 , But it is not clear whether Kohl’s will approve a sale, which would depend on whether the initial suitors can secure the necessary financing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Starboard has helped Acacia Research Corporation, which is leading the consortium’s bid, to raise equity to pay for its offer. Acacia has also received a letter of confidence from a bank pledging support for arranging debt. It is in talks with a firm that would sell off part of Kohl’s real estate to help fund the bid, in what is likely to result in a “sale-and-lease-back” transaction, in which a company leases back the real estate it has sold.                                                                                                                                      , Such sale-lease-back deals have worked at companies like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, but they have fared poorly for others like Sears, because the cost of rent can limit the company’s ability to spend on capital investment. They also often entail long-term leases, which could lock Kohl’s in to property at a time it needs to be nimble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Kohl’s said last year that various covenants inhibited its ability to do such deals. It also said moves like those could threaten its investment grade status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “We think adding fixed costs as margins hit multiyear highs and are at risk of retrenchment is risky, and we are wary of the rent expense that Kohl’s would have to shoulder through a full cycle,” analysts at Bank of America wrote about a potential lease-back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , By Jeremy W.

The trial, which was set to begin with jury selection on Monday morning, is now scheduled to start on Feb. 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Ms. Palin’s in-person testimony in a federal courtroom in Lower Manhattan this week was expected to be one of the focal points of the trial. She sued The Times in 2017 after it published an editorial that erroneously asserted a link between her political rhetoric and the mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011 that left six people dead and gravely wounded Gabrielle Giffords, then a Democratic member of Congress. The Times later corrected the editorial.                                                                                                                             , Ms. Palin’s lawyer, Kenneth G. Turkel, said in court on Monday that his client, a former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential nominee, was still eager to appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “She wants to be here for jury selection — she wants to testify live,” Mr. Turkel told the judge, Jed S. Rakoff. Ms. Palin has had three tests, all of which came back positive, according to the judge. He also said she was not vaccinated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , It is uncommon for a defamation case against a major news organization like The Times to advance to the point that it reaches a jury. It would be even less common for The Times to lose one of these cases — that has not happened in 50 years in an American court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The law offers robust protections to journalists and news outlets when a public figure like Ms. Palin accuses them of defamation. The Supreme Court has said it is not enough for public figures to prove that their reputation was damaged; the publisher of the damaging report must have acted with “actual malice” by either knowing the information was false or displaying a reckless disregard for the truth.                                                                                                                                                                                 , But Ms. Palin’s lawyers have argued in court filings and in public that the law is too broad in shielding journalists from liability. The larger constitutional questions about the limits of press protections won’t come up in this trial, but they loom over the case, which is being watched closely by media organizations and First Amendment scholars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , By Niraj Chokshi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Boeing announced an additional $450 million investment in Wisk Aero on Monday, expanding its bet on autonomous, electrified flight. The funding will help to fuel ambitious growth plans at Wisk, which is working to develop a self-flying electric air taxi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “With this investment, we are reconfirming our belief in Wisk’s business and the importance of their work in pioneering all-electric, A.I.-driven, autonomous capability for the aerospace industry,” Marc Allen, Boeing’s chief strategy officer, said in a statement. Self-flying aircraft are “key to unlocking scale” in passenger and cargo flight, he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Boeing declined to share the size of its previous investment in Wisk, a joint venture of Boeing and Kitty Hawk, which is financed by Larry Page, who co-founded Google. A spokesman for Wisk, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., declined to say how much total investment it had received so far, but said Boeing had been the company’s largest investor since the joint venture was formed. Wisk employs about 360 people and plans to increase that work force by about 70 percent over the next year.                                                                                     , The niche market for electric aircraft that take off like helicopters, fly like planes and can carry a handful of passengers short distances has attracted billions of dollars in investment in recent years, in the hope that the technology could supplement and supplant urban transportation and help airlines to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , A handful of air taxi start-ups, including Archer Aviation, Joby Aviation, Lilium and Vertical Aerospace, went public last year and have a combined valuation of about $6 billion today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , American Airlines, a major Boeing customer, invested in Vertical Aerospace and has said it plans to buy up to 250 of that company’s aircraft. United Airlines, another major Boeing customer, invested in Archer and plans to buy up to 200 aircraft from it. Wisk sued Archer last year, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and infringing on its patents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Wisk is developing its sixth-generation aircraft. If that autonomous vehicle is certified for flight, the company plans a fleet allowing it to carry out millions of annual zero-emission flights in nearly two dozen cities, it said. The Federal Aviation Administration has yet to approve any electric air taxi, autonomous or not, for flight, and experts say it could still be years before such aircraft are ready for public use.                                                                                                                                                           , By Coral Murphy Marcos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Microsoft earnings: The tech giant is scheduled to publish its earnings report for the last three months of the year.

Some think there is even a chance that officials will slow bond buying more quickly than they previously planned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Boeing earnings: Investors will be looking for an update on when Boeing will resume shipping its 787 Dreamliner after quality concerns led the company to slow production and suspend deliveries. The company said last week that it sold a net 535 new planes last year after factoring in cancellations, capping its best year of sales since 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Tesla earnings: With a major computer chip shortage slowing vehicle production for many companies, investors will want to hear more on how Tesla increased its deliveries 87 percent in 2021. The earnings report will also cover a period when Tesla’s market value exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, making it more valuable than General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota, BMW and several other automakers combined.                                                                                                                                                                            , G.D.P. growth: The Commerce Department will publish data on gross domestic product growth in the United States. Some experts estimate that the global chip shortage alone knocked off a full percentage point from the U.S. G.D.P. last year, and they estimate an overall annual growth of 5 to 6 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Southwest earnings: Investors will want to learn more about how the Omicron variant of the coronavirus upended Southwest Airlines during the busy holiday season, as well as the company’s forecast for the year. A series of winter storms, coupled with staff shortages as employees called in sick, prompted a wave of flight cancellations by several airlines at the end of 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Apple earnings: Analysts expect the company to share more about the effects of an update that allows Apple users to choose not to be tracked across apps and websites, which has disrupted companies that used that information to target ads. Shareholders will also want to learn more about the demand for the iPhone 13 over the holidays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , McDonald’s earnings: With fast food prices rising at their fastest pace in more than 20 years, economists are looking for insight into how much longer the American chain will keep passing on the higher costs of ingredients to consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Chevron earnings: The oil giant will report its earnings for the end of the year, giving investors more details on new drilling strategies and its profits as oil and natural gas prices rose throughout 2021. The report will cover a time when Chevron pledged to slash operational emissions to net zero by 2050.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Employees at an REI store in Manhattan filed for a union election on Friday, making the outdoor equipment and apparel retailer the latest prominent service-industry employer whose workers have sought to unionize. The filing at the REI store in SoHo asked the labor board for an election involving about 115 employees, who are seeking to be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, the same union that has overseen the union campaign at the Amazon warehouse in Alabama.                                                                                         , Prices are rising faster than they have in 40 years, taxing consumers’ wallets and befuddling policymakers. It’s not clear if this is because of temporary disruptions in supply and demand during the pandemic, or the result of some long-dormant force that will push prices higher for longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The New York Times asked readers for their questions about inflation, and received hundreds of responses. Jeanna Smialek, who covers the Federal Reserve, put the queries to economists and other experts for answers. Here are a few:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Competition should keep prices in check. But Matthew Luzzetti, the chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said the problem is uncertainty. It’s a risky time to jump into any market, or ramp up supply to take advantage of higher prices that might be temporary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Even if companies wanted to produce new or more products, supply chain issues are a barrier. Until new competitors can produce and transport enough of a given product to meet demand, incumbents will be able to raise prices without much risk of losing customers to a rival.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Wages increased sharply alongside inflation in the 1970s and 1980s, but in the decades since, pay has struggled to keep pace with price increases. Nonetheless, intensifying competition in lower-wage service industries in recent months has led to higher pay for workers. Factors like unionization, worker bargaining power and the state of the labor market all affect whether companies pay more.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Richard Nixon was the last president to embrace price controls. His efforts worked for a time, but prices rocketed up when they were lifted, and the move got a bad rap among economists. But some think they should be tried again: A vocal minority of economists say the 1970s experience unfairly tarnished the idea and that it might be worthwhile to reopen the debate. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South African Rand Weakens </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The South African rand was trading around 15.3 against USD, pulling away from an over 2-month high of 15.1 hit on January 21, as the dollar gained ground amid escalating geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East ahead of a looming Federal Reserve meeting at which policymakers will decide on the next steps for US monetary policy. Meanwhile, there are expectations that the South African Reserve Bank will lift its repo rate to 4% at its first monetary policy decision of the year on January 27th. South Africa's annual consumer inflation quickened faster than expected to a near five-year high of 5.9% in December from 5.5% in November, moving closer to the top of the central bank’s target range of 3-6%. On the other hand, concerns over South Africa's economic outlook persist due to its fiscal, political and structural shortcomings, as well as uncertainty around the pandemic. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Will Russia-Ukraine tensions push up UK gas bills? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> High energy prices are already causing problems for households in the UK and across Europe, but geopolitical tensions threaten to make matters even worse.                                                , With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine, there are fears that Vladimir Putin is poised to order an invasion.                                                           , Surging gas prices have already caused a number of UK energy suppliers to go bust - and supply shortages are the last thing anyone needs.                                                                 , Not directly. The UK sources very little of its gas from Russia - less than 5%, in fact.                                                                                                                  , However, that is not the case for the EU, which gets about half of its gas from there.                                                                                                                    , Any Russian attempt to seize Ukrainian territory is likely to prompt economic sanctions by Western powers.                                                                                                , In response, Russia would be expected to "weaponise" its natural resources by cutting supplies of gas to Europe.                                                                                          , The wholesale cost of gas would then rocket, sending prices higher everywhere.                                                                                                                            , Among possible sanctions, there is talk of excluding Russia from cross-border payment systems, which would mean that European countries would have trouble even buying Russian gas in the first place.    , About half of UK gas supplies are of domestic origin, from the North Sea. The UK has been a big producer of gas since the mid-1960s, but output has fallen since 2000 and usage continues to rise.        , Another one-third of the UK's gas comes through pipelines from Norway.                                                                                                                                    , The rest consists almost entirely of imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrive in Britain by sea from countries such as Qatar, the US and even Trinidad and Tobago.                            , The small amount of Russian gas that does reach the UK comes in LNG form.                                                                                                                                 , LNG supplies are particularly sensitive to global market prices and are sold to whoever pays the most, with China one of the keenest bidders.                                                             , The government says the UK's energy bill crisis is due to high global gas prices, not security of supply.                                                                                                 , It says the UK has a "diverse and secure" range of suppliers.                                                                                                                                             , However, that could change quite rapidly if Russian gas becomes scarce, causing a knock-on effect as other countries scrabble for alternative supplies.                                                   , Demand for gas is rising across Europe and some fear the UK could be physically - and perhaps politically - at the back of the queue.                                                                     , What's more, the UK has scant storage facilities. It's been increasingly operating a "just-in-time model", which means it's more affected by short-term price fluctuations in the wholesale gas market.   , The government stresses it's "not complacent".                                                                                                                                                            , And if needed, it does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas.                                                              , But the biggest factor - the weather - is beyond its control. Our best hope for avoiding problems is if the rest of the winter turns out to be mild, breezy and wind power-friendly.                      , A perfect energy storm was brewing during 2021.                                                                                                                                                           , A cold winter around the world sent gas demand rising, depleting stores.                                                                                                                                  , Those reserves would normally have been replenished over the summer. But output dropped because many major producers were catching up with maintenance postponed during lockdowns.                        , Meanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power.                                                                                                                        , As a result, wholesale gas prices have more than quadrupled over the past year.                                                                                                                           , The UK has been badly hit because it's one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of our electricity.                          , Even without a big freeze or a Russian supply squeeze, bills are heading up.                                                                                                                              , Households have seen their energy bills kept in check by the government's price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, but this is due to be revised on 1 April.                              , As a result, fuel bills could increase by another 50% in the next few months, the energy industry has said.                                                                                               , Whatever happens, economists say wholesale gas prices are unlikely to drop before storage facilities fill up again - and that's not likely until spring.                                                  , Rising energy prices have already contributed to a big surge in the UK's cost of living, which is increasing at rates not seen for 30 years.                                                              , The energy bill crisis, along with soaring food costs, drove inflation to 5.4% in the 12 months to December, up from 5.1% the month before, in another blow to struggling families.                       , The last time inflation was higher was in March 1992, when it was 7.1%.                                                                                                                                   , Businesses too have been feeling the strain, with five business groups writing to Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking for support for firms on energy costs.                                                    , The rise in global wholesale gas prices has been felt across Europe.                                                                                                                                      , Some suggest Brexit has meant the UK is at a disadvantage when it comes to getting the best deal.                                                                                                         , When it was in the EU, the UK was part of the Internal Energy Market which can enable countries to access electricity more smoothly and at lower cost.                                                    , However, the way gas is traded has been largely unaffected, which means leaving the EU has not had a significant impact.                                                                                  , Countries that rely heavily on imported gas, such as Italy and Spain, have been particularly hard hit. Their governments have directly cut prices and raised taxes on energy company profits respectively., The price cap has meant the UK's gas bills have until now been typically lower than the EU average.                                                                                                       , But the rise in prices comes on top of other economic problems such as labour shortages and increasing food prices, adding up to an unwelcome rise in the cost of living.                                 , Ricky Gervais chats acting and what his fans mean to him                                                                                                                                                  , Join Andi and Miquita Oliver on the journey of a lifetime                                                                                                                                                 , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on China's 10-year government bonds extended its downward trend to trade below 2.69%, the lowest since May 2020, after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) slashed its key rate for a second time in a row and pledged to use more monetary tools to support the slowing economy. Meanwhile, the central bank has injected 150 billion yuan into the banking system in an effort to maintain liquidity ahead of the Lunar New Year. Both the 1-year and the 5-year loan prime rates were cut on January 20th, after the PBOC had already slashed short- and medium-term lending rates on January 17th. Investors believe there is still room for more easing measures this year, including a cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio or further reductions in key borrowing costs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The ruble-based MOEX Russian Index plunged 5.9% to close at 3,235 level on Monday, the lowest since December of 2020, amid heightened geopolitical tension. Continued prospects of heavy sanctions from western states against Russia due to the imminent threat of military action in the Russia-Ukraine border triggered a vast equity sell-off in the Moscow exchange. Among the blue chips, Gazprom fell 8.7% as sanctions could put into question the approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline by Germany. At the same time, the tech sector plunged over 12%, pressured by the exposure to foreign investment and projections of tighter policy by the Central Bank of Russia.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on Germany’s benchmark Bund fell towards -0.09% in late January, after touching positive territory for the first time since May of 2019 on January 19th, as investors regained an appetite for safe-haven bonds amid increased volatility in equity markets. Also adding to concerns, tensions at the Russia-Ukraine border were back at the forefront, as Joe Biden mulls boosting American military presence in Eastern Europe and EU officials reiterated warnings to Russia of harsh sanctions. Still, looking forward the demand for bonds is set to decline as major central banks are becoming more hawkish. The Federal Reserve will hike the fund's rate in March for the first time since 2018 and the bets are rising that the European Central Bank will raise its deposit rate for the first time in eleven years later this year and bring it to zero by the end of 2023. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Futures Reverse Gains, Earnings and Fed in Focus </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US futures cut early gains on Monday, with contracts on the Dow Jones falling more than 200 points and both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq losing more than 1%, following a broad sell-off last week. Traders remain cautious ahead of big tech earnings reports this week including IBM, Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple, after disappointing results last week from companies including Netflix and Goldman Sachs. Also, the Fed is expected to confirm a rate hike in March and a balance-sheet reduction later this year although the size of the rate hike is still uncertain. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between the US and Russia over Ukraine weighed on investors' moods as military action by Russia could come at any time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russian Ruble at 14-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Russian ruble weakened to 78.8 against the greenback in the last week of January, the lowest since November 2020, amid heightened geopolitical tensions regarding growing military activity in the Russian border with Ukraine. Ongoing talks in between NATO members and Moscow failed to de-escalate the imminent threat of military action, as western states continue to raise prospects of heavy sanctions against Russia. Elsewhere, Russia's central bank is seen raising interest rates further next month to tame inflation, erasing previous expectations that rates would ease in 2022. Yearly inflation was at 8.4% during December, among the highest rates since January of 2016 and far above the Central Bank of Russia’s target of 4%, prompting the CBR President Elvira Nabiullina to state consumer prices are expected to rise in the foreseeable future. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Peloton takes another hit from TV heart attack </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Public relations headaches for trendy exercise brand Peloton keep coming, with another unfavourable TV reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , After a fictional character in the Sex and the City reboot died of a heart attack using a cycle machine, there's been a brush with death in Billions.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , SPOILER ALERT: A central character in the hit series about a hedge fund also has a heart attack using his Peloton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , He survives, though, even jokingly referencing the death in the Sex and the City sequel, And Just Like That.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , In the real world, Peloton has also been having a rough time. The share price has crashed, Peloton has paused production as sales fade, and there are reports of investors agitating for the chief executive to go.                                                                                                                                           , The pandemic lockdown turned Peloton, which makes stationary bikes and treadmills with live-streamed workouts from popular instructors, into one of the hottest leisure brands around.                                                                                                                                                                        , In the new series of Billions, which aired on Sunday, Mike "Wags" Wagner, played by David Costabile, is taken to hospital with chest pains after using his spin bike.                                                                                                                                                                                         , On his return to the office Wags tells staff "I'm not going out like Mr Big". That's a reference to the And Just Like That character (played by Chris Noth) who dies using his machine.                                                                                                                                                                       , Although the Billions episode was produced before Mr Big's death, the reference was reportedly included later to add a contemporary feel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , After the first episode's screening, Peloton tweeted that it did not agree to its brand nor intellectual property being used in the show. The firm also emphasised the importance of cardo-vascular activity.                                                                                                                                                 , That tweet, and another from the company's global head of communications, prompted some lively replies, including that Bobby Axelrod, the rapacious hedge fund boss in Billions (played by Damian Lewis) should short Peloton shares - a bet the price will fall.                                                                                             , After the And Just Like That death, Peloton tried to recover the PR narrative with a parody advert featuring Chris Noth alive and well, and benefitting from exercise. But that backfired after allegations of sexual assault, which he denied.                                                                                                               , Arguably, though, there is more serious damage to the Peloton brand. Sales - and the Peloton share price - boomed during lockdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But the company, worth $50bn at the peak of its popularity is now valued at about $8bn as the share price crashed as orders slowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The Wall Street Journal has reported that activist investor Blackwells Capital wants to oust John Foley, Peloton's co-founder and chief executive.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The investment firm is urging Peloton to sell itself to a company like Disney, Apple, Sony or Nike, according to reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , After Mr Foley last week said Peloton was temporarily halting production due to lower demand, he wrote to staff that "layoffs would be the last lever (the company) would ever hope to pull" but that it is evaluating the structure and size of the team and that it was "considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible"., Ricky Gervais chats acting and what his fans mean to him                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Join Andi and Miquita Oliver on the journey of a lifetime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , © 2022 BBC.

Well that an interesting way to look at it. 🙄

&amp;quot;Rather than suggesting Biden was to blame for multiple setbacks in his administration, WAPO columnist Rubin instead blamed that the media coverage is too focused on &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot; or things that he could never achieve.

&amp;quot;Perhaps, he has absorbed the advice of many Democrats: Don’t talk about failure or things you cannot achieve. You might not know it from the media coverage, but his first year still remains among the strongest of any modern president,&amp;quot; Rubin wrote.&amp;quot; </td>

My thoughts on the mkt today  ... today very well may have wiped out a lot of investors, as capitulation day often does. It also may have provided one of the best opportunity days of the year as we had almost a 200 handle move from lows to highs. And if you had my Game Plan I sent out to members this weekend, you knew this day was EXACTLY the action I was looking for and I gave a whole list of names that would be on sale and they all had massive bounces. 

So is the bottom in? As I emailed members mid morning after we hit my 421.5/422 target (we actually traded slightly below), that to me felt like the bottom for the day. Sure enough, the rest of the day we soared.  And as I posted on ST the other day, short squeeze rallies can be vicious and that helped fuel the frenzy higher. 

We have a mountain of catalysts ahead - Powell/Fed, big earnings, and crucial economic data. TSLA, AAPL, and AMZN soared. But we aren&amp;#39;t completely out of the woods yet. Buckle up! </td>

CPI number thats coming out also uses a different formula which is meant to cook the numbers more or less so we come much much less than it really is. both will cause a rally. rather a backtest from where the banks will short again. perhaps they&amp;#39;ll shill ukraine and blame that. US embassy evacuating means they got word shits gonna go down. a bit of a heads up sorta speak. and even from a technical stand point we climaxed today and are due for a bounce that&amp;#39;ll most likely be a backtest. were not going back to those highs or hitting new ones. were in a bear market. ride the small bounce up then switch to shorting the bigger trend. </td>

The Biden family bagged $31 million from just five deals in China - all inked with individuals who have direct ties to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence, claims author Perter Schweizer in his new book, Red-Handed: How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win.

As Breitbart News reports, &amp;quot;Multiple financiers with direct ties to Chinese intelligence partnered with Hunter Biden during and after his father’s time as Vice President — including the former head of the Ministry of State Security and the head of foreign intelligence recruitment — and some of those relationships remain intact,&amp;quot; according to Schweizer. </td>

IMO the two cases are not comparable. In 2008 sp500 declined 47% already and it was looking for a bottom. Here, SP500 declined a typical 10% correction, nothing exceptional.  
I am not saying this is bullish long term, this is actually bearish, but I think there is more upside and we should not make new lows. If we go below $SPY 426, the whole thing may be in trouble.  
Next serious resistance is at 458, a more serious one is at 473, if we clear this one new ATH will be very likely. GL. </td>

Good luck everyone! </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ $DJIA   It appears to me we have a clear 3 waves down in SPY. The question in my mind; is today&amp;#39;s close the end of wave 4 up? I believe it is. It retraced 38% of wave 3 down which is typical. Wave 3 is “extended” so the following rules apply for determining the length of wave 5 to come; If wave 4 ended at 440.5 at the close as I suspect, that leaves 3 possible targets for wave 5 down: 417 where wave 5 down = length of wave 1 -or- 403 where wave 5 down = length of wave 1 x 1.61 -or- 380 where wave 5 down = length of wave 1 x 2.62. If wave 4 continues up above today&amp;#39;s close, it could reach 447 (or higher) which would be a 50% retracement of wave 3. That’s not unusual. If it does that, all the above ending wave 5 targets would ratchet up which I can calculate at that time. Key now is finding if we move higher from today&amp;#39;s close. I hope that was sufficiently confusing :) </td>

My thoughts on the mkt today  ... today very well may have wiped out a lot of investors, as capitulation day often does. It also may have provided one of the best opportunity days of the year as we had almost a 200 handle move from lows to highs. And if you had my Game Plan I sent out to members this weekend, you knew this day was EXACTLY the action I was looking for and I gave a whole list of names that would be on sale and they all had massive bounces. 

So is the bottom in? As I emailed members mid morning after we hit my 421.5/422 target (we actually traded slightly below), that to me felt like the bottom for the day. Sure enough, the rest of the day we soared.  And as I posted on ST the other day, short squeeze rallies can be vicious and that helped fuel the frenzy higher. 

We have a mountain of catalysts ahead - Powell/Fed, big earnings, and crucial economic data. TSLA, AAPL, and AMZN soared. But we aren&amp;#39;t completely out of the woods yet. Buckle up! </td>

Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall keeps his Neutral rating and $142 price target on Apple shares heading into earnings. The company&amp;#39;s iPhone business should see positive results with upside risk to his December numbers, but retail sales data and Chinese CAICT data suggest slower momentum in the month of December, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Hall adds that while this may be linked to consumers purchasing earlier than normal in the quarter, it may also drive more cautious commentary from Apple looking into the March quarter. </td>

 i eventually was seeing massive 10&amp;#39;s of Billions in Darkpool orders on scanner .  that was weird to see as the market hadnt dropped much. but it clearly was early selling..

In a spasm of panicked selling early Monday, retail investors offloaded a net $1.36 billion worth of stock by noon, most of it in the first hour, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. strategist Peng Cheng. By his estimate, share disposals were 3.9 standard deviations heavier than the full-day average in the previous 12 months.&amp;quot; </td>

Now it’s green territory from -1100 .. where are they now ?!

Tsk tsk .. stop using politics on this stock ..

It’s the big players toying you with fears and wiping out all the margins so no one plays and let it rip .. and force you to sell at cheap price so they see it as steal deal!

That’s how they do that !! 

Now it was the beginning of new cycle from markdown heading to accumulation. Meaning .. it’s about to mark up soon within with FOMC and/or ER .. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA First day of retirement and what a day to just occasionally look at my phone, too. What broken insanity is this. 1k pt intraday reversal on the DOW? You new traders this is not normal by any means. Now, when we knew the Covid dip and rip happened, there would be a lot of FOMO from those who missed it. But if a true market pullback would happen, it would come 2 fold as there be a big wave of FOMO they take advantage of. 

If this pulls back again to todays lows across the board, then I feel it&amp;#39;s a sign of another 15% getting ripped off indexes and a period of serious stagnation, and I would be careful buying any dips. As shorts often get killed, always trying to guess market tops....trading bulls can make the same mistakes trying to time the bottom. 

Investors just keep bullets ready for the worst-case scenario and don&amp;#39;t be on margin, so they are not forced to capitulate. Best of luck to you all. Best advice I can give. GLTA </td>

My thoughts on the mkt today  ... today very well may have wiped out a lot of investors, as capitulation day often does. It also may have provided one of the best opportunity days of the year as we had almost a 200 handle move from lows to highs. And if you had my Game Plan I sent out to members this weekend, you knew this day was EXACTLY the action I was looking for and I gave a whole list of names that would be on sale and they all had massive bounces. 

So is the bottom in? As I emailed members mid morning after we hit my 421.5/422 target (we actually traded slightly below), that to me felt like the bottom for the day. Sure enough, the rest of the day we soared.  And as I posted on ST the other day, short squeeze rallies can be vicious and that helped fuel the frenzy higher. 

We have a mountain of catalysts ahead - Powell/Fed, big earnings, and crucial economic data. TSLA, AAPL, and AMZN soared. But we aren&amp;#39;t completely out of the woods yet. Buckle up! </td>

Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Tesla TSLA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Tesla is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TSLA in this report.

In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.21 per share for TSLA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TSLA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.69% heading into earnings season. </td>

It’s funny the most serious WH communications get unnoticed even when it is contradicting itself - example :

Biden this morning says he doesn’t watch stock market 📉- don’t care (posted) 

Then WH in a statement said that WH does watch the stock market carefully ! Ooopps 

One more example !

Biden told one of the reporters what a stupid question - when she tried to ask him why he’s waiting for Putin to invade Ukraine n not taking action before! 

Biden thinks if Russia 🇷🇺 crosses Ukrainian border a little is different from crossing the borders by miles 🤣🤣🤣

Tickers #AUUD #AUUDW 
#faidr #vodacast #AItechnology #media #radio
Auddia CEO Michael Lawless said, &amp;quot;We are very encouraged about the early indicators we are seeing around user adoption and engagement ahead of our launch of over 4,000 radio stations on the platform in February. Our messaging resonated well in Sonoma, indicating that people are drawn to an interruption-free radio experience, and we can&amp;#39;t wait to see how this accelerates as we take a giant step up in scale next month.&amp;quot;
In addition to the new design, the faidr application will include new-music discovery and expanded content features. It will be available in both iOS and Android operating systems and allow new users to choose between free and subscription-based product experiences once an initial 30-day trial expires.

Now she needs to break above 9EMA of $1000, if she does that then she will be heading to the 50 EMA at $1020.  Breaking above $1020 will take her out of the short term green channel. Which will lead to $1090. I see TSLA reaching $1090 easily before earning if the market is green. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA Guys, Im a TSLA bull but must listen.  IBM has fallen from 138 AH to 130.8.  This was potentially dictating a higher open likely to reverse and fall 3-400 Dow pts.  Tomorrow is going to be a whack day.  Dont think we retest 850 but stock rocketed from 890 to 930 in last 15 min or so.  Will trade below 900.  Would take it here and buy back lower. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA bulls on here come up with any wild reason to justify this insane valuation: &amp;quot;We will have flying cars in 100 years.  Elon just released a limited edition meme. Elon is God. Elon taught Einstein. First electric car in the world.&amp;quot; They come up with anything. Many of them bought for cheap and therefore fell in love with the stock. They got lucky that the Twitter pumper is untouchable by the SEC, and that he can literally made turd 10x in value with a mere tweet. Nothing do do with the company. The valuation is based on the conman it self. Any other CEO, and the stock would plummet.  The greatest conman of all time, and all his Twitter followers ate it up. Unreal. Charles Ponzi is a noob in comparison. Teslatards have apotheosized this conman, and some even rank him above the great Newton, which is downright disgusting. Elon is not even in the Edison class, and Edison is not even in the Tesla class. What a fraud. Too many bulltards. The company was not even his. </td>
