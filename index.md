   <td style="text-align:left;"> Autonomous-car 'users not legally accountable' call </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Human drivers should not be legally accountable for road safety in the era of autonomous cars, a report says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In these cars, the driver should be redefined as a "user-in-charge", with very different legal responsibilities, according to the law commissions for England and Wales, and Scotland.                                                                                                                                                 , If anything goes wrong, the company behind the driving system would be responsible, rather than the driver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , And a new regime should define whether a vehicle qualifies as self-driving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In the interim, carmakers must be extremely clear about the difference between self-drive and driver-assist features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , There should be no sliding scale of driverless capabilities - a car is either autonomous or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , And if any sort of monitoring is required - in extreme weather conditions, for example - it should not be considered autonomous and current driving rules should apply.                                                                                                                                                                , The law commissions were asked in 2018 to come up with a series of reports on the regulatory framework for automated vehicles and their use on public roads.                                                                                                                                                                           , In this final report, their recommendations include:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Transport Minister Trudy Harrison said the government would "fully consider" the recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Scottish and Welsh governments will also decide whether to introduce legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Matthew Avery, chief research strategy officer at Thatcham Research, which was involved in the consultation, said: "We applaud the recommendations that compel carmakers to use appropriate terminology when marketing these systems, to prevent motorists from becoming convinced that their car is fully self-driving when it is not., "In the next 12 months, we're likely to see the first iterations of self-driving features on cars in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "It's significant that the Law Commission report highlights the driver's legal obligations and how they must understand that their vehicle is not yet fully self-driving"                                                                                                                                                              , Last year, the Department for Transport gave the green light to automated lane-keeping systems (ALKS), the first type of hands-free driving to be legalised in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                 , Drivers using ALKS will not need to monitor the road or keep their hands on the wheel but must stay alert and be able to take over within 10 seconds when requested by the system.                                                                                                                                                     , Tesla, one of the leading companies developing driverless cars, has faced a barrage of questions over its marketing of Autopilot, which is similar to ALKS and considered level two on the five defined levels of self-driving cars.                                                                                                   , Last week, Californian prosecutors filed two counts of vehicular manslaughter against the driver of a Tesla went through a red light, while using Autopilot, hitting another car and killing two people - the first time someone has been charged with manslaughter when using a partially automated driving system.                   , Previously in the US, a driver was killed when playing a video game while using Autopilot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , And in 2018, a UK resident was banned from driving after climbing into the passenger seat of his Tesla on the motorway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , How one ship triggered a global crisis...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Why were chances missed to catch serial killer Dennis Nilsen?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Why Italy's new president could make or break economy </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> MPs in Italy are electing a new president this week, a secret ballot that is usually hard to predict and this time is no different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The head of the Italian state has limited powers, but the President does appoint a prime minister and can influence the government's economic strategy and with a general election due early next year, a lot is at stake.                                                                                                                                              , The next prime minister, probably heading a coalition government, must ensure the recovery of the economy continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The pandemic hit Italy hard, but it faced years of stagnation before that, and foreign investors hope the EU member state will stay on the path towards growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , On Tuesday, following a second round of voting, which proved inconclusive, Italy's conservative alliance proposed three possible candidates, leaving the centre-left parties to respond as parliament remains divided over a successor to President Sergio Mattarella.                                                                                                  , The leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, told a news conference: "We are not here to impose anything on anybody."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Critics of Italy's political system, where governments are usually a coalition of different parties, may say the economy has dodged a bullet because the controversial former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi pulled out of the race at the weekend.                                                                                                                   , The current Prime Minister, Mario Draghi, a former head of the European Central Bank, is seen as the frontrunner to take up residence in the Quirinale Palace, once the home of Popes and Kings, but the favourite rarely wins.                                                                                                                                         , As president he would have the power to appoint a prime minister, veto appointments to the cabinet and send legislation back to parliament for MPs to reconsider. These are powerful tools to keep reforms on track and could stop any future government from derailing the economy.                                                                                    , If Mr Draghi did become the next President of the Italian Republic, who would replace him as the prime minister and would the current political stability in Rome suddenly be in doubt?                                                                                                                                                                                 , At the start of the coronavirus pandemic the Italian economy suffered heavily, as the country went into a severe lockdown, but businesses are seeing good growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "The current government is a broad coalition led by former ECB President, Mario Draghi, and it's not clear which kind of coalition might come out of the next general election, which is currently due in early 2023," Paola Subacchi, Professor of International Economics at Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC's World Business Report.                   , The health of the economy is tied to political stability and that has been achieved with Mario Draghi at the helm, she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Mr Draghi has successfully garnered cross-party support for the European Union's recovery plan and created momentum for reforms and stronger financial discipline.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Italy is the largest beneficiary of the EU's €750bn ($847bn, £627bn) recovery fund and it is expected to receive €191bn ($215bn, £160bn) in grants and loans.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , If Mr Draghi wins the race to become president, his success at creating political unity as Prime Minister, which led to positive momentum for the economy, could be undermined with new cracks appearing between parties which would be posturing ahead of the general election next year.                                                                              , Forecasts of economic growth of about 4% this year are promising and compare favourably with the dramatic contraction of almost 9% in gross domestic product in 2020 as the country suffered from the shock of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                            , Experts are saying Italy has a once in a generation opportunity for an economic reboot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Valentina Meliciani, a professor of economics at Luiss University in Rome, said: "Political parties have different views about the direction of different economic policies for the future of the country.                                                                                                                                                              , "However political stability is really necessary for overcoming the pandemic and for making the best use of the resources that are now available from the recovery."                                                                                                                                                                                                    , She told the BBC World Service that "in the last year we experienced an exceptionally high rate of growth, more than 6% and also the forecasts for the coming year are quite positive."                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mario Draghi is not regarded as part of the Italian political structure and before being parachuted in to take over as Prime Minister in February last year, the economist and academic had been the President of the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019. He is credited as saving the euro currency, which had been under threat during the eurozone debt crisis. , Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at the Italian Treasury, is worried that if Mario Draghi wins the race to the Quirinale Palace the challenge to fill the vacancy in the Prime Minister's office could cause a crisis.                                                                                                                                         , "There might be political crisis because the parties might no longer be wiling to support the Draghi government and that would precipitate early elections," he told the BBC.                                                                                                                                                                                           , "In a year that is so important for the EU recovery plan and Italy's promises on reforms and investment losing five or six months of policy making is something that Italy cannot afford to do," he said.                                                                                                                                                               , The next Italian President will quickly have to start the process of creating political unity to ensure there are no major divisions that could torpedo economic policies.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Valentina Meliciani, from Luiss University in Rome, says foreign investors are watching the presidential election closely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "A non-divisive president may play an important role in ensuring that the general interests of the country prevail over the specific interest of the different parties."                                                                                                                                                                                                , "In order for our country to perform well in the long run and keep debt under control we need growth, in order to fulfil all these conditions, stability and competence in the President and Prime Minister are really essential," she said.                                                                                                                            , It is worth remembering that role has not traditionally gone to a party leader and the favourite going into the race to move into the Quirinale often loses out.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The president is elected for a term of seven years by an electoral college comprising 1,009 people, mostly members of parliament, as well as senators and 58 delegates of Italy's regions.                                                                                                                                                                              , In the first three rounds of voting, the winner must secure at least a two-thirds majority, but from the fourth round, an absolute majority is enough.

was open to becoming president, describing himself as a "grandfather at the service of the institutions."

commissioner for the economy                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Those hoping to see Italy's first female president may pay close attention to the current and former justice ministers, Marta Cartabia, 58, and Paola Severino, 73.

She also claimed that she was in a romantic relationship with him and that he was the father of her twin children, according to the documents.                                                                                               , The woman, Apple said, emailed Mr. Cook photos of what she said was a handgun and ammunition she had purchased, along with comments like, “My new gun will never return it at this time before I shoot!” Apple also wrote that she filed documents to create fraudulent corporations, some with sexually explicit names, while naming Mr. Cook as the executive and listing his home address on the forms.                                                                                       , The situation escalated in October, when the woman appeared outside Mr. Cook’s Palo Alto home in a car with a Virginia license plate and said she wanted to speak with him before security sent her away, according to court documents. She returned minutes later and was stopped by local police officers. They searched her car and did not find any weapons, but they towed the vehicle because her license was expired. She told them that she “could get violent,” according to the filing., The woman continued to send Mr. Cook threatening emails, Apple wrote, including one in early January telling him that he “must empty the condo” and that she would “move in next week.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “Apple believes that respondent may be armed and is still in the South Bay Area and intends to return to Apple C.E.O.’s residence or locate him otherwise in the near future,” the company wrote.

The order also prohibits her from contacting Mr. Cook or tagging him on social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Advertisement </td>

Xbox hardware revenue grew more modestly at 4% — in part because numbers in late 2020 had been boosted by the release of Microsoft’s Xbox Series X system, the company’s first new console since 2013., GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Microsoft expects that snapping up Activision, the owner of popular games such as Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft, will boost demand for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service while also advancing its broader ambitions for creating immersive virtual worlds. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)It's a confusing time for Americans when it comes to world affairs, with the government explaining on the one hand why it was time to pull out of Afghanistan, but on the other why it's also time to stand up for Ukraine.                                                                                                                                   , It's a time when Americans want their military less committed abroad.

But Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Russia expert at the White House, makes a compelling argument in The New York Times that she knows exactly what he's after, at least in terms of Ukraine: Putin "wants to evict the United States from Europe."      , She writes, "As he might put it: 'Goodbye, America.

"It almost feels like the market is behaving a little incoherently, not knowing which way to go – go down because the Fed is tightening or go up because the Fed is finally acting to rein in inflation and is loading up on ammunitions while economic growth remains strong."                                                            , The Fed is slated to conclude a two-day policy meeting Wednesday, with an announcement coming at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank isn't expected to announce any policy changes, but investors will look for clues on when — and by how much — the Fed will raise interest rates later this year. Investors will also look for hints on the next steps the Fed will take to further unwind the stimulative measures taken in 2020 to support the economy at the pandemic's onset., "Between rate hikes and tapering the $9tn balance sheet, we could be looking at a monetary regime that is changing quickly," Gaggar said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Treasury yields have jumped sharply to start the year in anticipation of tighter monetary policy from the Fed. Last week, the benchmark 10-year note yield briefly broke above 1.9%. On Tuesday, the yield closed at 1.77% — that's still more than 20 basis points above where it ended 2021.                                                                                                                                                                              , On the data front, International trade numbers are slated for release Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies declined by 872,000 barrels for the week ended Jan. 21, according to sources. The API also reportedly showed a weekly inventory climb of 2.4 million barrels for gasoline, while distillate supplies fell by 2.2 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., delivery hub edged down by 1 million barrels last week, sources said. Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday. On average, the EIA is expected to show crude inventories down by 2.1 million barrels, according to a survey of analysts conducted by S&amp;P Global Platts. The survey also calls for a weekly supply increase of 2.2 million barrels for gasoline and an inventory decline of 1.6 million barrels for distillates.

In September 2021, the Central American nation became the world's first country to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.                                                                                                               , Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele — who has tethered his political fate to the success of the country's bitcoin experiment — has added hundreds of bitcoin to the country's balance sheet in recent months. On Friday, the president tweeted that he bought an additional $15 million of "really cheap" bitcoin, as the crypto market plummeted. Bitcoin is down about 50% from its November record high.                                                       , The IMF report went on to say that some directors had expressed concern over the risks associated with issuing bitcoin-backed bonds, referring to the president's plan to raise $1 billion via a "Bitcoin Bond" in partnership with Blockstream, a digital assets infrastructure company.                                                                                                                                                                       , Part of El Salvador's nationwide move into bitcoin also involved launching a national virtual wallet called Chivo that offers no-fee transactions and allows for quick cross-border payments. For a country where 70% of citizens do not have access to traditional financial services, Chivo is meant to offer a convenient onramp for those who have never been a part of the banking system.                                                                 , IMF directors agreed that the Chivo e-wallet could facilitate digital means of payment, thereby helping to "boost financial inclusion," though they emphasized the need for "strict regulation and oversight." Many Salvadorans have reported cases of identity theft, in which hackers use their national ID number to open a Chivo Wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive to open a digital wallet., For months, the IMF has bemoaned Bukele's bitcoin experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Tuesday's statement echoes a report shared by the IMF in November, in which the financial regulator wrote that bitcoin's high price volatility translated to significant risks to consumer protection and noted that bitcoin should not be used as legal tender.                                                                                                                                                                                                , El Salvador has also been trying since early 2021 to secure a $1.3 billion loan from the IMF — an effort that appears to have soured over this bitcoin row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The country will need to figure out some other backstop to shore up its finances. The IMF predicts that under current policies, public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 20216, putting the country on "an unsustainable path."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Got a confidential news tip?

        FFIV,
        -2.44%
       fell more than 17% in the extended session Tuesday after the software company reported quarterly earnings and sales above Wall Street expectations but said supply-chain snags are crimping its ability to meet increased demand. F5 said it earned $94 million, or $1.51 a share, in the fiscal first quarter, compared with $88 million, or $1.41 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, F5 earned $2.89 a share, compared with $2.59 a share a year ago. Sales rose 10% to $687 million, the company said. Factset consensus called for an adjusted EPS of $2.78 a share on sales of $678 million. There was "strong demand" for F5's application security and delivery products, Chief Executive Francois Locoh-Donou said in a statement. While that demand "remains robust, the company expects that its ability to meet customers' continued strong demand for systems will be restricted by supply-chain constraints for the remainder of fiscal year 2022." As a result, the company called for fiscal second-quarter revenue between $610 million and $650 million. The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect sales of $693 million for the quarter. For fiscal 2022, F5 expects revenue growth between 4.5% and 8%, down from a prior expectation of 8% to 9% growth. The company expects fiscal 2022 software revenue growth "near the top end" of a previously provided 35% to 40% guidance range,  and fiscal 2022 global services revenue growth of 1% to 2%, it said. F5 ended the regular trading day down 2.4%. , The market was anxious over what will come Wednesday after the central bank wraps up its two-day monetary policy meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

That would make residential customers less likely to invest in solar systems and installers less motivated to sell them, White said.  </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Federal prosecutors looking at 2020 fake elector certifications, deputy attorney general says - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Federal prosecutors are reviewing fake Electoral College certifications that declared former President Donald Trump the winner of states that he lost, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told CNN on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "We've received those referrals. Our prosecutors are looking at those and I can't say anything more on ongoing investigations," Monaco said in an exclusive interview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The fake certificates falsely declaring Trump's victory were sent to the National Archives by Trump's allies in mid-December 2020. They have attracted public scrutiny amid the House's January 6 investigation into the pressure campaign that sought to reverse Trump's electoral defeat.                                                                                                                                                             , Monaco did not go into detail about what else prosecutors are looking at from the partisan attempt to subvert the 2020 vote count. She said that, more broadly, the Justice Department was "going to follow the facts and the law, wherever they lead, to address conduct of any kind and at any level that is part of an assault on our democracy."                                                                                                    , This is the first time that the Justice Department has commented on requests from lawmakers and state officials that it investigate the fake certifications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The certificates contain the signatures of Trump supporters who falsely claimed to be the rightful electors in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico -- all states that President Joe Biden had won. Some of the certificates were sent by top officials representing the Republican Party in each state, according to the documents, which were obtained and made public by the watchdog group American Oversight., In response to Monaco's new comments, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul told CNN in a statement that it was "critical that the federal government fully investigates and prosecutes any unlawful actions in furtherance of any seditious conspiracy."                                                                                                                                                                                                , The New Mexico Attorney General's office previously said it is reviewing the matter under state law, and like other states, has referred it to the Justice Department via their US attorney's office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "We have received information from the New Mexico Attorney General's office, but we can't comment on it at this time," Scott Howell, a spokesman for the US attorney for New Mexico, told CNN on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In her interview with CNN, Monaco also touted the efforts the Justice Department has made to address the threats and harassment that election officials have faced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "I'm concerned about the really disturbing nature of the threats that we've seen. They've been disturbingly aggressive, and violent and personal," Monaco said.

       Amazon Public Policy Twitter account on Tuesday said the company supports a measure by Congresswoman Nancy Mace, D.-S.C., to legalize cannabis. "We're pleased to endorse @RepNancyMace's States Reform Act," the company said. "Like so many in this country, we believe it's time to reform the nation's cannabis policy and Amazon is committed to helping lead the effort." The measure, which was formally introduced in November, would decriminalize cannabis from Schedule I with states to decide on prohibition or regulation.

There were four bids, pushing the price up 11% to $170 million. A closer look reveals something curious: The offers were reportedly made by a finance entity owned by the Rizhao government, meaning the city effectively sold land to itself., Across China, local government financing vehicles have replaced cash-strapped property developers as the biggest buyers of land for real estate development, stoking fresh concerns over the ability of these off-balance sheet borrowers to repay a debt pile that tops $8.4 trillion by some estimates. </td>

In 2015, at a screening of a film that focused on inaccurate claims that vaccines can cause autism,  he called the number of children "injured" by vaccines (again, a baseless claim) "a holocaust," CBS News reported at the time. He later apologized for making the comparison but doubled down on his inaccurate claims of vaccines causing autism. , Kennedy, who married Hines in 2014, late last year said Hines asked guests of a holiday party they were hosting to get vaccinated or test negative before arriving. He told Politico that while Hines imposed the vaccine recommendations, neither took measures to verify vaccination or test status.                                                                                                                         , CNN's Sarah Fortinsky and Aileen Graef contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold prices traded above $1,850 an ounce on Tuesday, the highest since November 18th, underpinned by inflation concerns, softer US bond yields and increased safe-haven demand. Persistent price pressures pushed the yellow metal higher as annual inflation rates soared to multi-decade highs across major economies, headlined by the US consumer price index which accelerated to its fastest pace in almost 40 years at 7% in December. Gold also gained as the benchmark 10-year US yield fell below 1.8% on Friday, easing from a 2-year peak of 1.9% hit earlier last week. Additionally, recent market volatility and geopolitical tensions lifted the bullion’s safe-haven appeal. Meanwhile, investors remained cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting this week, as it is expected to tighten monetary policy at a much faster pace than previously thought to tame persistently high inflation. </td>

Unfortunately, it’s wise to prepare for much worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Credit...Matt Chase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Supported by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , By Jeff Sommer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Jeff Sommer writes Strategies, a column on markets, finance and the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Where is the stock market heading? That can be an urgent question — especially when you’re losing money in a fickle market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , As the wild stock market swings that started the week demonstrated, no one knows where the market is going, not hour by hour or day by day. What’s more, no one on Wall Street has been able to predict reliably where the market will be next month or next year, though plenty of people are constantly trying to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Really, we’re all in the dark, and when stocks are shaky, that’s not a pleasant place to be. Yet there are compelling reasons to stay in the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , A moment like this one, when the stock market’s perils are obvious, can be an opportunity — a time to figure out whether your investments are appropriate and to take action if they are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Stocks really haven’t fallen all that much — not when you consider how high they have gone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Investor gains have been stupendous since March 2020, for example, when the Federal Reserve intervened near the start of the pandemic and set off a bull market. Through Jan. 3, when the recent decline began, the S&amp;P 500 returned 114 percent, including dividends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Stock returns have been marvelous over much longer periods, too. Since March 2009, when the Fed intervened during the Great Recession, the S&amp;P 500 returned 762 percent including dividends through Jan. 3. Go back a bit further and you’ll find that in the 50 years from the start of 1972 the S&amp;P 500 returned more than 18,000 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , It may help to keep that history in mind when you contemplate the recent market storms: If you’d put $10,000 in S&amp;P 500 stocks at the start of 1972 and just left it there, it would be worth more than $1.8 million today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The history of long-term market gains emphatically does not guarantee anything about future returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , There’s a dark side, too. Periods of excruciating losses known as bear markets are as much a part of stock investing as the far more enjoyable runs during bull markets. Losses much deeper than this month’s drop are virtually certain to occur if you hold stocks long enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Bear markets in the last 50 years included declines of:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , 34 percent from February to March 2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , 57 percent from 2007 until March 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , 49 percent from 2000 until 2002                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , 34 percent in 1987                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , 27 percent from 1980 to 1982                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , and 48 percent from 1973 to 1974.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , I’ve owned stock through several of those miserable periods. It wasn’t fun. But owning bonds helped to buffer the pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , For the most part, high-quality bonds, especially U.S. Treasurys, have performed well when stocks have declined. The more stocks scare you, the more likely it is that high-quality bonds will be soothing. Knowing that you own these reliable assets may even help you hold on to the stocks in your portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , You can do this by owning a fund that contains both stocks and bonds, like target-date funds, which are designed for people saving for retirement and tend to become more bond-heavy over time. Even simpler are indexed balanced funds, portfolios that track the stock and bond markets and maintain a steady allocation over long periods. Both varieties of funds rebalance for you automatically — meaning, they achieve a desired allocation to stocks and bonds by selling stocks (or bonds) when they are high and buying them when they fall in value., Portfolios containing both stocks and bonds tend to be far less volatile than pure stock investments. That can be a very good thing when the stock market’s lurches become gut-wrenching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Vanguard Balanced Fund provides a clear example. Like most of the giant asset management firm’s offerings, it is based on plain vanilla index funds. The fund’s biggest loss in recent years was 12.3 percent from Feb. 1, 2020, through March 20, 2020, during the coronavirus downturn, according to Morningstar, a research firm known for its ratings of mutual funds. That may not look good until you compare it with a decline of 28.3 percent for the S&amp;P 500 during the same period, including dividends.                                         , That Vanguard fund contains 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds, which is about right for me. But if that seems too volatile, hold more bonds; if it’s too stodgy, add stocks, particularly those from elsewhere in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But by all means, choose an asset allocation and stick with it. Check whether your current allocation is out of whack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The bull market may have swelled the proportion of stocks in your portfolio inordinately. If that’s the case, rebalance. Sell some high-value stocks and put the money into bonds. Later on, if the stock market falls, you can sell some bonds to buy stocks. Better yet, let a balanced fund (or a target-date fund) do it automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Diversified, low-cost, broad-based index funds, which mirror the overall market, are a much safer way to invest in stocks and bonds than buying individual securities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , If you pick the right stock — say, Apple — and hold it for decades, you will outperform any index fund. Since 1989, the numbers show, Apple’s returns are about 20 times greater than those of the S&amp;P 500.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But picking and holding a stock like Apple from the beginning is exceedingly difficult. Apple was a miserable stock through much of the 1980s and 1990s. Would you have known to stick with it when it was near bankruptcy? I did not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Furthermore, unlike Apple, roughly 96 percent of the securities in the U.S. stock market don’t earn money for investors at all over long periods, according to research by Hendrik Bessembinder, a professor of finance at Arizona State University. Professor Bessembinder has since found that in global markets, too, most stocks won’t earn you money over the long run.                                                                                                                                                                                   , Broad, low-cost index funds take care of these problems. You’ll own little pieces of a lot of mediocre stocks, but the winners have pulled the indexes higher, regardless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , None of this guarantees that you will make money in stock funds, however.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , After bear markets, American stocks have always come back and redeemed their losses. But that might not be true forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , After all, the Japanese stock market has not yet recovered from a decline that began in 1989. The United States has many advantages, but that predicament could arise here one day. That’s a reason for diversifying globally. At a minimum, it’s quite possible that other markets will be better in the years ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Knowing these risks, I continue to buy broad, low-cost, stock-and-bond index funds with every paycheck, even when the market seems to be going crazy. When share prices fall, I remind myself that I’m buying more cheaply this month, and hope for substantial gains down the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , These are bets, not a rock-solid foundation for the future. But the bonds are more reliable. If you’re deeply troubled by stocks, perhaps you don’t own enough bonds. I find they give me peace of mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Iowa weighs proposal to shield retirement income from state taxes </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist on the debt ceiling, taxes, spending and infrastructure negotiations and the possible expansion of the IRS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Iowa Republicans on Monday unveiled a proposal to exempt pensions and other retirement income from state taxes, a move intended to keep retired Iowans in the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The bill, sponsored by Rep. Gary Mohr, chairman of the Iowa House Appropriations Committee, would cost the state about $2 billion in revenue over the first six years by exempting income from a 401(k) plan, IRA or pension from taxation, according to The Associated Press. The measure has the support of 55 of the 60 Republicans in the Iowa House of Representatives.                                                            , IRS TAX-FILING SEASON TO KICK OFF ON JAN. 24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "There’s a lot of people in Iowa who move out of Iowa once they retire, particularly where I live, and frankly I’d like to stop that outmigration as quickly as possible," Mohr told reporters on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , He noted that two of the top destinations for Iowa retirees – Illinois and Florida, according to the Iowa Public Employees Retirement System – do not have a state income tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Sweeping views of the downtown area and the Des Moines River Valley can be enjoyed from the top of the capitol steps.

And they lose interest in the state. That’s a non-economic loss. But I think it’s a huge loss in the state of Iowa."                                                                                                         , Although Illinois does not tax pensions, it does have a relatively high tax burden: According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, Illinois has the tenth-highest tax burden in the country with a rate of 10.8%. By comparison, Iowa has an overall tax burden of 10.8%, placing it at 13th, while Florida is ranked 43rd with an overall rate of just 8.8%.                                                                             , Other popular destinations for Iowa retirees include Missouri and Nebraska, Mohr said, although it's unclear whether taxes play a role in that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In all, there are 12 states that do not tax retirement income: Washington, Alaska, Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, according to AARP. Of those, nine don't tax any individual income. There are two other states – Alabama and Hawaii – that do not tax pensions, but do impose a levy on distributions from 401(k) plans and IRAs.                    , Social Security cards with cash and benefit amount numbers (iStock)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Iowa taxes most types of retirement income, including Social Security.

Kim Reynolds, a Republican, has introduced a similar proposal to shield retirement income from state taxes, but it would not go into effect until 2023. Mohr's bill would begin this year. She has also called for a 4% flat tax that Iowa would phase in over four years. The plan will reduce state revenues by about $500 million in 2023 and by nearly $1.6 billion in 2026, according to estimates from Reynolds' office., Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern the package could disproportionately benefit wealthy Iowans while leaving lower-income families worse off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "It’s going to be a tax increase for a lot of Iowans," Senate Minority Leader Zach Wahls said in January. "If you work part time and you’re not currently paying the 4% rate, for a lot of folks it’s actually going to be an increase." </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures rebounded more than 2% to above $85 per barrel on Tuesday after falling more than 2% in the previous session, as rising geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East stoked fears of supply disruptions. NATO said on Monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, in a move that was denounced by Russia. In the Middle East, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement launched a missile attack at the UAE on Monday that targeted a base hosting the US military, but was thwarted by US-built Patriot interceptors. Oil prices have gained more than 10% since the start of the year to reach 7-year highs last week, as strong demand and supply constraints significantly tightened the market. However, a combination of profit-taking and a Fed-driven risk-off sentiment led to a correction in oil markets on Monday. Meanwhile, traders await industry data from API on Tuesday for the latest weekly estimate of US oil inventories. </td>

Conversely, the Swiss National Bank is committed to its ultra-loose monetary policy stance, having previously commented it will only take hawkish stances after other major central banks. In its latest survey, the OECD stated that the SNB should only tighten policy once its post-pandemic recovery fund is firmly established, as Swiss inflation is likely to remain moderate and there is no alarming reason to change course. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Arabica coffee futures on ICE were trading around $2.4, not far from the 10-year high of above $2.50 set on December 6th 2021, as the production outlook remains dependent to the extent to which last year's frosts and drought adversely impact the forthcoming crop in top producer Brazil. Late rains have flooded coffee fields in central eastern areas in Brazil but some concerns mounted after below normal levels reported in the past week. Also, persistent shipping bottleneck caused by the spreading pandemic, higher costs of fertilizers and fuels and ongoing labor shortages should continue to exert upward pressure on coffee prices. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> SEC chair eyes tougher cyber rules to protect investors against hackers </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler is eyeing tougher cybersecurity rules to protect investors against financial loss and theft of personal data by hackers, he said in a speech Monday.                                                                                                                                            , The agency's top official is considering more stringent requirements for a diverse set of firms underpinning the country's financial infrastructure, including publicly traded companies, financial advisors, brokerage houses, trading systems, and firms that custody client assets, among others.                                                     , The economic costs of cyberattacks extend into the billions and perhaps even trillions of dollars, Gensler said. The state and non-state hackers perpetuating the crimes often try to steal data, intellectual property or money; lower confidence in the financial system; and disrupt economies, he said.                                              , "All this puts our financial accounts, savings, and private information at risk," Gensler said Monday at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law's Annual Securities Regulation Institute.                                                                                                                                                                   , "The financial sector remains a very real target of cyberattacks," he added. "What's more, it's become increasingly embedded within society's critical infrastructure."                                                                                                                                                                                  , At a meeting on Wednesday, SEC commissioners will consider whether to propose new cyber standards for Treasury trading platforms, Gensler said.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Specifically, the agency would bring the platforms under the umbrella of an existing rule — Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity — which currently covers entities like stock exchanges and clearinghouses. The measure ensures firms have sound technology programs, business continuity plans, testing protocols and data backups, Gensler said., The bureau chair has also asked staff to recommend reforms in a few other domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , More from Personal Finance:Here's what aid to expect from a smaller Build Back BetterDon't expect a refund for jobless benefits this tax seasonWhat to know about getting free at-home Covid tests                                                                                                                                                       , For example, Gensler suggested rules to reduce risk among investment companies, investment advisors and broker-dealers by improving their "cybersecurity hygiene and incident reporting."                                                                                                                                                                , Gensler also wants the agency to consider updating the reporting and disclosures brokerages and financial advisors make to customers following a cyber breach. The agency may also update cyber practices and risk disclosures that public companies make to their investors, Gensler said.                                                              , "I think companies and investors alike would benefit if this information were presented in a consistent, comparable, and decision-useful manner," Gensler said of publicly traded companies.                                                                                                                                                             , Lastly, he asked staff to weigh tougher standards for financial service providers like fund administrators and custodians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Got a confidential news tip?

Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said in an interview on Monday.                                                                                                    , She said the findings showed a critical need to support domestic manufacturing and called on Congress to pass legislation aimed at bolstering U.S. competitiveness with China by enabling more American production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “It’s alarming, really, the situation we’re in as a country, and how urgently we need to move to increase our domestic capacity,” Ms. Raimondo said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The findings show demand for the chips that power cars, electronics, medical devices and other products far outstripping supply, even as global chip makers approach their maximum production capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , While demand for semiconductors increased 17 percent from 2019 to 2021, there was no commensurate increase in supply. A vast majority of semiconductor fabrication plants are using about 90 percent of their capacity to manufacture chips, meaning they have little immediate ability to increase their output, according to the data that the Commerce Department compiled.                                                        , The need for chips is expected to increase, as technologies that use vast amounts of semiconductors, like 5G and electric vehicles, become more widespread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The combination of surging demand for consumer products that contain chips and pandemic-related disruptions in production has led to shortages and skyrocketing prices for semiconductors over the past two years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Chip shortages have forced some factories that rely on the components to make their products, like those of American carmakers, to slow or suspend production. That has dented U.S. economic growth and led to higher car prices, a big factor in the soaring inflation in the United States. The price of a used car grew 37 percent last year, helping to push inflation to a 40-year high in December.                             , The Commerce Department sent out a request for information in September to global chip makers and consumers to gather information about inventories, production capacity and backlogs in an effort to understand where bottlenecks exist in the industry and how to alleviate them.                                                                                                                                                   , The results of that survey, which the Commerce Department published Tuesday morning, reveal how scarce global supplies of chips have become.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The median inventory among buyers had fallen to fewer than five days from 40 days before the pandemic, meaning that any hiccup in chip production — because of a winter storm, for example, or another coronavirus outbreak — could cause shortages that would shut down U.S. factories and again destabilize supply chains, Ms. Raimondo said.                                                                                       , “We have no room for error,” she added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , To help address the issue, Biden administration officials have coalesced behind a bill that the Senate passed in June as an answer to some of the nation’s supply chain woes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The bill, known in the Senate as the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, would pour nearly a quarter-trillion dollars into scientific research and development to bolster competitiveness against China and prop up semiconductor makers by providing $52 billion in emergency subsidies.                                                                                                                                            , Momentum on the legislation stalled amid ideological disputes between the House and Senate over how to direct the funding. In June, House lawmakers passed a narrower bill, eschewing the Senate’s focus on technology development in favor of financing fundamental research.                                                                                                                                                        , But administration officials, led by Ms. Raimondo, have begun prodding lawmakers behind the scenes in an effort to help bridge their differences to swiftly pass the bill, emphasizing the urgency of quickly signing solutions into law.                                                                                                                                                                                             , “There’s no getting around this. There is no other solution,” Ms. Raimondo said. “We need more facilities.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , On Tuesday evening, House Democrats unveiled a sweeping, 2,900-page bill that lawmakers said they hoped would be a starting point for negotiations with the Senate, in an effort to ultimately pass a manufacturing and supply chain bill into law. In a statement minutes after the bill text was made public, President Biden hailed both proposals and encouraged “quick action to get this to my desk as soon as possible.”       , In short supply. Around the world, industries are struggling because there are too few computer chips. Here is what to know:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , A vital component. Computer chips, also known as semiconductors, are the brains of products like smartphones, cars, medical devices and most modern appliances. ​​The vast majority are made in Taiwan, South Korea and China.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , How the shortage began. Computer chips started becoming scarce early in the pandemic, when chip buyers, in particular automakers, slashed their orders fearing a global recession. In response, semiconductor plants reduced their production.                                                                                                                                                                                        , An increase in demand. As the pandemic forced people to spend more time at home, global demand for products like desktop monitors and printers surged. By then it was too late for the chip industry to increase production quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Ongoing struggles. Adding back chip-making capacity can require as much as two years of lead time and billions of dollars. Manufacturers have scrambled to fill orders from their largest customers, making things exceedingly difficult for smaller companies.                                                                                                                                                                       , Troubles in the U.S. The Biden administration has warned that the U.S., which only accounts for 12 percent of global production, is facing “alarming” shortages that threaten American factory production and could fuel inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In search of solutions. President Biden has called on Congress to pass a stalled bill that would prop up semiconductor makers by providing $52 billion in subsidies. Cities and companies like Intel and Ford also have taken steps to support local production.                                                                                                                                                                      , The Commerce Department’s survey found that it takes companies twice as long in some cases to procure certain in-demand chips, sometimes as long as a year. Survey respondents also said they did not see the supply-demand mismatch in the industry dissipating in the next six months.                                                                                                                                              , The shortages have affected larger legacy chips, which are necessary for auto production, as well as the most advanced chips required to power technologies like artificial intelligence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Ms. Raimondo said she had spent “an enormous amount of time” talking about the shortage to chief executives, some of whom had personally taken to hunting around the world for a small number of chips crucial to their supply chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                , She added that the survey also revealed the worrying extent to which the United States was reliant on Taiwan for the most advanced chips. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has become the contract manufacturer of choice for many companies, which may design their chips in the United States but turn to Asia to manufacture them.                                                                                       , China considers its claim to Taiwan nonnegotiable, and it has been taking an increasingly aggressive military posture toward the island, potentially putting the U.S. supply of advanced chips at risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , In a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Ms. Raimondo said that the survey had also uncovered unusually high prices for semiconductors that are sold through brokers, and that the Commerce Department would be investigating those practices.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The Biden administration has set up an early alert system to notify government and industry of impending chip shortages and convened company leaders to try to address the issue, among other actions. It has also welcomed industry investment while acknowledging that any new construction of chip manufacturing facilities in the United States will take several years and will not provide an immediate remedy to the shortages., On Friday, Intel announced that it would invest $20 billion in a facility in Ohio, which would contain two chip factories and directly employ 3,000 people. Construction of the first two factories is expected to begin this year, but production will not start until 2025, Intel said.                                                                                                                                             , Advertisement </td>

The organization slashed its growth estimates for the U.S. to 4% in 2022, down 1.2 percentage points from October. It marked the biggest reduction suffered by any G-7 nation and comes as the Federal Reserve prepares to begin aggressively normalizing policy in order to combat rising inflation. , Shipping containers are unloaded off a ship at the Port of Boston's Conley Terminal in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday, Jan. 21, 2022.  (Allison Dinner/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The IMF also reduced its growth outlooks for both China by 0.8 percentage points, with Beijing expected to now grow by 4.8% this year as the government enforces a strict "zero-COVID" policy and the country grapples with "projected financial stress" among its real estate developers.                                                                                                                                          , Inflation has accelerated as the economy recovers from the brief but extremely severe recession in 2020, and is expected to remain elevated for "longer than envisioned" amid ongoing supply-chain disruptions and high energy prices, the IMF said. However, the organization predicted that prices will begin to subside as "supply-demand imbalances wane in 2022 and monetary policy in major economies responds."              , The dramatic rise in consumer prices over the past 12 months – in December, inflation hit a fresh 40-year high – has forced the Federal Reserve to dramatically shift its policy stance, including rapidly slowing its bond purchases, ending the buying program earlier than expected and setting the table for a March interest rate hike.                                                                                        , A pedestrian walks past a pre-owned car sales lot in Miami, Florida on January 12, 2022.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Aluminum Prices Continue to Rise </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Aluminum prices approached $3,100 per tonne in the last week of January, a new high since October last year, amid falling inventories and expectations of large deficits as the power crisis, especially in Europe persists, and smelters need to cut production. At the same time, tensions between the US and Russia over Ukraine brought the possibility of sanctions on Russian aluminum producers. Meanwhile, a ban on Indonesia's exports of thermal coal prompted a surge in coal prices, which will likely to push aluminum production down in both China and India. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Manufacturing Activity Index in the US fifth district fell to a 4-month low of 8 in January of 2022 from 16 in December, due to declines in the indexes for new orders and employment. Survey results indicated firms continued to struggle to find the skills that they need despite solid increases in wages. The third component in the composite index, the index for shipments, increased slightly. The backlog of orders index dropped considerably, while the index for vendor lead time remained high and inventories indexes remained near historic lows. Firms’ perceptions about changes in local business conditions remained slightly negative; however, firms are optimistic about future conditions. The average growth rate of prices paid and prices received by survey participants increased in January. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst Gen.

Jack Keane joined "Varney &amp; Co."

JACK KEANE: I believe President Biden had made a serious strategic error here, and that is not to use preemption actions prior to an invasion to deter. After all, he has gone to the option of using the threat of consequential action after an invasion to deter the invasion. And that has always been fundamentally flawed, in my view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , UKRAINE RACING TO DOWNPLAY FEARS OF RUSSIA INVASION AS US SENDS MILITARY AID                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Yes, those troops should have been in NATO's countries weeks ago.

And yes, put the troops in our allied countries to reassure them and also send a message to Putin that he's not going to move on NATO in any way.

It was the lowest level in business morale since March of 2021, as confidence deteriorated in the manufacturing industry (-0.8 vs 3.1 in December), largely due to lower assessments for total order books, while negative sentiment increased for trade (-4.8 vs -3.5), due to low intentions of placing orders.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The world economy will likely grow by 4.4 percent this year, compared to a 4.9 percent expansion previously estimated, and by 3.8 percent in 2023, according to the IMF's latest update of the World Economic Outlook. The downward revision for 2022 reflected uncertainty about the pandemic due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, inflation, supply disruptions and monetary policy tightening by major central banks. The US is seen growing by 4 percent in 2022, down by 1.2 percentage points from early estimates, given the failure of President Joe Biden to pass a massive social and climate spending package. Meanwhile, China's economic growth forecast was lowered by 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 percent and the Eurozone's GDP projection was cut by 0.4 percentage points to 3.9 percent. Elsewhere, India and Japan saw their forecasts upgraded somewhat. The IMF has also revised up its 2022 inflation forecasts, saying price pressures were likely to persist longer than previously expected. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)On its face, it's not a big deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Joe Biden, thinking his microphone was off, called Fox's Peter Doocy a "stupid son of a bitch" after the latter lobbed a question to the President about the political impact of high inflation. Once it was clear he was speaking on a hot mic, Biden quickly called to apologize to Doocy.                                                       , And, scene. This is just the sort of tempest in the teapot that Washington obsesses over (Biden said a bad word!) and that the average voter couldn't care less about.                                                                                                                                                                             , Which means we shouldn't linger too long on this episode. After all, presidents have been caught on hot mics before saying less than complimentary things and it has never mattered to their presidency. Not one bit.                                                                                                                              , Before we move on, however, I do think it's worth pointing out one thing: How utterly normal the news cycle of Biden's "son of a bitch" comments was.                                                                                                                                                                                              , The President said something he shouldn't have said. It was both nasty and an unnecessary distraction. Within about an hour of saying it, he had called Doocy to personally apologize.                                                                                                                                                             , Now, compare that series of events to what we all experienced over the previous four years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Donald Trump regularly berated and belittled members of the media, and never once apologized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "I say that you're a terrible reporter," he told NBC's Peter Alexander in March 2020. "That's what I say. I think it's a very nasty question, and I think it's a very bad signal that you're putting out to the American people."                                                                                                                  , "You are a rude, terrible person," Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta in late 2018. "You shouldn't be working for CNN."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In that same press conference, Trump called PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor, a woman of color, a "racist" for asking a question about white nationalists supporting him.                                                                                                                                                                             , And, of course, Trump repeatedly called the media "the enemy of the people" -- in person and on Twitter -- throughout his presidency.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Rather than apologize, Trump wore his willingness to attack those who covered him -- often in personal terms -- as a badge of honor. He would tout his willingness to tell off individual reporters to adoring crowds, suggesting that he was the only one in the country to tell the truth about the media.                                       , This lowering of the bar -- in terms of the relationship between a president and the media -- was part of a broader effort by Trump to fundamentally alter what it meant to be president. Trump cast this approach -- via tweet -- as "MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL" but, in truth, it was simply bad manners.  Rudeness turned into political strategy., That Biden called a reporter a "stupid son of a bitch" is regrettable. That he called to apologize for it is commendable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Don't disregard the fact that we now have a president, again, who operates under the normal rules of decorum and politeness. When a president does the right thing, it trickles down to the rest of society. And, as we saw over the past 4 years, the opposite is also true.                                                                      , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Home Prices Rise 1.1% in November: FHFA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The average prices of single-family houses with mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States increased 1.1 percent from a month earlier in November 2021, the same pace as in October. The last four months reflected average gains of 1 percent, down from the larger prior changes during the spring and summer months, and suggesting home price growth will likely slow further in 2022 amid higher interest rates. For the nine census divisions, monthly house price changes ranged from +0.5 percent in the West North Central division to +1.9 percent in the South Atlantic division. Year-on-year, house prices rose 17.5 percent in November, little-changed from a 17.4 percent increase in the previous month. "This new trend is a welcome shift but still twice the monthly average we have seen in the last 20 years, which echoes concerns about access and affordability in housing markets.”, said Will Doerner, Supervisory Economist in FHFA’s Division of Research and Statistics. </td>

Now companies are designing a little city hubbub back into suburban headquarters by adding shops, restaurants, hotels, residences and public parks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The change in the concept of the corporate campus reflects two related trends that executives say appear to be unaffected by the pandemic. The first is the public and private investment in communities across the country that is making suburbs more dense, walkable, bike-friendly and less dependent on cars. The second is the competition to attract the brightest young employees who want to live and work in lively places.                                                                               , “It’s urbanization of the suburban experience,” said Alex Krieger, professor of urban design at Harvard and a principal at NBBJ, an architecture and planning firm in Boston. “Companies are bringing some of the characteristics of the city to their suburban campuses.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , One prominent example is in Tysons, Va., a Washington suburb where Capital One has expanded its 24-acre campus with a performing arts hall, a Wegmans supermarket, a 300-room hotel and a rooftop park, all for corporate and public use. Across the street, a 30-story office building under construction will include ground-floor retail and restaurant space.                                                                                                                                                   , “As a company, we think, ‘What can we offer to our associates or to potential associates?’” said Jonathan Griffith, Capital One’s managing director. “We wanted vibrant mixed-use amenities that are public-facing to bring in that energy that we all kind of thrive off of.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Other examples are appearing across the country. Walmart is building a 350-acre headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., that includes 2.4 million square feet of office space, a hotel, a food truck plaza, a walking and biking trail and retail shops open to visitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “The connection and integration of our new home office into the surrounding northwest Arkansas community is a primary principle of our design strategy,” said Cindi Marsiglio, senior vice president for corporate real estate at Walmart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In 2018, JPMorgan Chase opened a regional headquarters in a $3 billion mixed-use development in Plano, Texas, called Legacy West, which has apartments, stores, restaurants and hotels. Two years later, the bank opened another office in Legacy West close to offices of companies like Liberty Mutual Insurance, Toyota and FedEx.                                                                                                                                                                               , “JPMorgan chose a site that’s adjacent to this massive, really cool, mixed-use environment with food and restaurants and an urban vibe,” said Michael Nicolaus, principal and director of commercial and residential mixed use at HKS Architects, which designed the bank’s first office and Capital One’s global headquarters. “It’s all about being a part of something bigger than yourself, which is the kind of environment that they think they need to attract and retain the best and the brightest people.”, Microsoft spent $149.5 million last year to buy 90 acres on the western edge of Atlanta to build a regional headquarters. The company said its plan for the parcel was not fully formed, with one exception. In February, the company revealed that it would invite residents of Grove Park, a neighboring African American working-class community, to help design 25 percent of the site for “construction of affordable and empowered housing and other local community services and needs.”                     , “Looking outside as well as within is an important step in our campus and office design,” Michael Ford, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for global workplace services, said in an email. “We take pride in designing spaces that help us connect with our neighbors.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The company’s strategy is to become an integral part of the community, said Ellen Dunham-Jones, the director of the Urban Design Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “Microsoft is asking, ‘What can we do for equity and to mitigate gentrification that is the most progressive thing that no one else is doing?’” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Such concerns are a sharp departure from the expansive, private, single-use suburban headquarters built in the 20th century that featured large parking lots and typically included cafeterias. Urban history specialists trace the design trend to 1942 when AT&amp;T Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from Manhattan to a 213-acre campus outside Summit, N.J.                                                                                                                                                       , Others took the same path out of the city. In 1958, General Mills opened its suburban headquarters, a statement of glass-enclosed modernism, eight miles outside Minneapolis. IBM moved from Manhattan and opened its gated headquarters in 1964 in Armonk, N.Y., on land that was once an apple orchard. Allstate opened its headquarters in 1967 on 122 acres in Northbrook, Ill., outside Chicago.                                                                                                               , Capital One’s plan for a new headquarters fit the 20th-century model in 1999 when it bought 26 acres in Tysons Corner, a four-square-mile commercial center near the intersection of the Capital Beltway and the Dulles Toll Road, two of the busiest highways in suburban Washington. At the time, Tysons Corner was the embodiment of what the author Joel Garreau called an edge city — a concentration, outside a big city, of daytime shopping, entertainment and business that emptied at night.              , Capital One initially planned four matching 14-story office buildings. Each would have connecting parking decks with space for 1,600 cars. A barbed-wire security fence ringed the perimeter, and guardhouses were stationed at the entrances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “What was the thinking behind that?” said Mr. Griffith, the bank’s managing director. “‘We didn’t want people here on our secured campus. You know, stay away.’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In 2003, the company completed the first of the four office towers, but promptly abandoned its design plan because the spread-out, guarded corporate campus it envisioned no longer reflected the neighborhood. By then, the Federal Transit Administration, which oversees public transportation systems, and the State of Virginia had approved the extension of the Washington Metro, with four station stops in Tysons Corner, including one on Capital One’s doorstep.                                         , Not long after, Fairfax County initiated a plan to transform Tysons Corner into a community with more residences, safer pedestrian connections, public spaces and parks. In 2010, the county unveiled a comprehensive plan to encourage housing for 100,000 residents by 2050, roughly 75,000 more than today. The county helped lead a marketing campaign for the evolution of the planned community with a name change to simply Tysons.                                                                          , Capital One actively participated in the process because the new plan allowed companies to significantly increase the scale of their developments in return for offering public benefits. For example, Capital One could build taller and larger buildings if it also added a street grid to make walking more inviting.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Capital One easily won county approval for its redesigned headquarters. It includes the region’s two tallest office buildings — a 31-story tower completed in 2018 and a 30-story office tower scheduled to open this year. The two buildings have space for more than 5,000 employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , A block away is the events center, theater, hotel and grocery store. Among the design innovations is a 2.5-acre rooftop park with an 18-hole miniature golf course, a beer garden and food truck lot, a dog park and a 250-seat amphitheater 11 stories above the street.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Capital One Center is approved for four high-rise apartment buildings and 100,000 more square feet of restaurants and retailing. Mr. Griffith said the bank had not decided on a timetable for the additions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , When it’s completed, Capital One Center will encompass enough office, retail, entertainment and residential space to be its own downtown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “We think about where the world is headed and how to get there,” Mr. Griffith said. “Our campus reflects that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Advertisement </td>

continuing global recovery faces multiple challenges as the pandemic enters its third year. The Omicron variant has led to renewed mobility restrictions in many countries and increased labor shortages. Supply disruptions still weigh on activity and are contributing to higher inflation, adding to pressures from strong demand and elevated food and energy prices. Moreover, record debt and rising inflation constrain the ability of many countries to address renewed disruptions. We project global growth this year at 4.4 percent, which is 0.5 percentage point lower than previously forecast, mainly because of downgrades for the United States and China. Now, in the case of the United States, this reflects lower prospects of legislating the Build Back Better fiscal package and earlier withdrawal of extraordinary monetary accommodation, and continued supply disruptions. China’s downgrade reflects continued retrenchment of the real estate sector and a weaker than expected recovery in private consumption. We expect global growth to slow to 3.8 percent in 2023. Now the forecast is subject to high uncertainty and risks overall are to the downside. The emergence of deadlier variants could prolong the crisis. China’s zero-Covid strategy could exacerbate global supply disruptions, and a financial stress in the country’s real estate sector spreads through the broader economy. The ramifications would be felt widely. Higher inflation surprises in the U.S. could elicit aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve and sharply tightened global financial conditions.

of the world’s growth in recent years, the I.M.F. pointed to the collapse of the real estate sector and the zero-Covid policy that has restricted travel, shut businesses and reduced consumption.

With the pandemic entering its third year, a note of pessimism underlay the report. “Risks overall are to the downside,” Gita Gopinath, the first managing deputy director, said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Global economic losses related to the pandemic will total $13.8 trillion by the end of 2024, Ms. Gopinath estimated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The dimmed economic prospects come at a time when governments have less room to maneuver in how they spend their money. Debt levels have soared over the past two years as countries struggled with the health crisis caused by the pandemic and funneled aid to their citizens. Public spending is unlikely to reach the same levels in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The troubling rise in inflation that has doubled heating costs in much of Europe and made food less affordable in places like sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil has also lasted longer than anticipated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The pandemic has changed the way people in many parts of the world spend their money, shifting funds that might have been used for dining, travel and entertainment to goods they can play with, sit on or consume at home. That increased demand, combined with persistent difficulties in moving goods from one city or continent to another, skyrocketing energy prices and labor shortages, has driven up costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Some of those pressures are expected to wane toward the end of the year — but not everywhere. “In the United States the story is different,” the fund noted. The exit of so many people from their jobs has created more persistent labor shortages and driven up wages much more than in other countries. Americans’ high level of spending has also created some of the worst supply chain disruptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The U.S. Federal Reserve has made clear that its primary focus has shifted from stimulating the economy during the pandemic to fighting inflation. The bank, which is set to release its next policy statement on Wednesday, is raising interest rates and reeling in its purchases of bonds that ensured money would continue to flow through the economy. Other central banks, including those in Mexico and Brazil, are taking similar actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The strategy is to discourage people from borrowing money to buy a car or invest in a business and ratchet back demand for products that are in short supply. Creeping interest rates, though, risk not only slowing economic growth but burdening poorer nations with even bigger debts far into the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “If interest rates rise more sharply, that then puts extra strain on vulnerable developing countries which have most of their debt in dollars,” said Creon Butler, research director at Chatham House, a London research organization. That means governments must use scarce resources to repay bulging loans instead of adding hospital beds or feeding hungry children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The slowdown in China, which is both a major supplier and buyer of goods traded with other countries, is also setting off reverberations around the world. The once exuberant real estate market has plunged. The government has imposed the world’s most stringent restrictions and lockdowns to contain Covid, and unexpected power outages have further hindered industrial production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Growth in the euro area was revised down 0.4 percentage points to 3.9 percent, but for some countries, the drop was much steeper. Clogs in the supply chain, especially those affecting the auto industry, prompted the I.M.F. to estimate that growth in Germany — the largest economy in Europe — would decline by 0.8 percentage points, twice as much as the average of all countries that use the euro.

remains, but the fund expects severe illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths to drop to low levels by the end of the year.

chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the impact of this latest surge had not been as devastating: “We’re seeing evidence that Omicron is holding back economic activity, but nowhere near to the same extent as the virus did before.”

2022.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Hungary Hikes Key Interest Rate More than Expected </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The National Bank of Hungary raised its benchmark base rate by 50bps to 2.9 percent on January 25th, the highest since December of 2013 and the steepest increase since November of 2011, surpassing expectations of a 30bps hike to 2.7 percent. It was the eighth consecutive rate hike, as the central bank noted stronger than expected inflationary pressure during December, while core inflation is expected to pick up in the coming months. Consumer prices rose 7.4 percent yearly in November and December, the highest in 14 years and well above the central bank’s target of 2%-4%, driven by commodity, crop, and energy prices. Meanwhile, the MNB expects GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 to exceed the 6.3-6.5 percent level, while unemployment remains low in international comparison. Looking forward, the Monetary Council will continue the cycle of interest rate hikes until the outlook for inflation stabilizes at the central bank’s target. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Central Bank of Nigeria kept its monetary policy rate steady at a six-year low of 11.5% in January of 2022, in line with market forecasts. The decision aims to shore up the country's fragile recovery from the Covid-19 shock, despite an uptick in headline inflation. Nigeria’s annual inflation rate rose to 15.63% in December, after eight straight months of decline, amid a slight acceleration in prices of food. Governor Godwin Emefiele signaled in November 2021 that the existing monetary policy stance has supported the growth recovery and should be allowed to continue for a "little longer" to stabilize prices and achieve sustainable growth. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazil Consumer Confidence at 9-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The seasonally adjusted FGV Consumer Confidence Index in Brazil fell to 74.1 points in January of 2022 from 75.5 points in December. It was the lowest reading since April, as the economic expectations index fell 2.7 points to 80.7, due to a deteriorated outlook for the economic situation (-4.5 to 99.6) and financial situation of households (-0.9 to 84.6). On the other hand, the current economic conditions index increased 0.5 points to 66.1, driven by the gauge measuring household’s financial situation (+0.8 points to 60). “Consumer confidence starts 2022 on a negative note, influenced by expectations in the coming months. The resumption of the emergency aid improved current perceptions of the job market and contributed to reducing the gap between high- and low-income households. The deterioration in future economic expectations and financial situation will depend on the recovery of the job market, control of inflation, and lower uncertainty”, said survey manager Viviane Bittencourt. </td>

In short: invasion.                                                                                                    , I could not think of a starker contrast than these two national "celebrations."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Not only does January 26 mark the day the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples began, it sets up European invasion as an important source of Australian identity and pride. In doing so, it ignores more than 60,000 years of pre-colonial history. As we approach the end of January 2022, many Australians are once again questioning why this date continues to be celebrated.                                                                                                                    , Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been challenging the date since at least January 26, 1938 when, as a culmination of years of work by the Australian Aborigines League (AAL) and the Aborigines Progressive Association (APA), the first Day of Mourning was held.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , On this day, crowds gathered in Sydney to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of Europeans in Australia. Afterwards, hundreds of Aboriginal people and their supporters took part in a silent march in mourning of the devastating impact of colonization, the consequences of which include the theft and destruction of lands and cultures; decimation of populations by disease and massacres; destruction of families and kinship; ongoing discrimination; and economic, political and social exclusion.        , Indeed, the 1938 protest was "against the callous treatment of our people by the white men during the past 150 years," Day of Mourning organizer, Jack Patten, told fellow demonstrators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Since then, January 26 has been symbolic for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as a lightning rod for protest and awareness raising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , This will be a particularly significant year, as 2022 marks 50 years since the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established in the nation's capital, Canberra, on January 26, 1972. It was on this day that four Aboriginal men with a beach umbrella -- and the weight of history behind them -- set up on the lawns in front of the then-Australian Parliament House to bring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land and justice back to the forefront of national debate.                                                    , The term "embassy" was used to bring attention to the fact Aboriginal people had never ceded sovereignty nor engaged in any treaty process with the British Crown. To this day, the Embassy remains a site of protest for Indigenous land rights, sovereignty, and self-determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In the intervening decades, the language we use to talk about January 26 has changed hugely. For at least the past 30 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have reclaimed the day as "Invasion Day" or "Survival Day" to highlight, promote and share the ongoing culture and survival of First Nations cultures through marches, protests, festivals, vigils, and memorials.                                                                                                                                  , While some argue that a push to change the date is divisive, the intent is actually to bring us closer together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Reconciliation is about fostering better relationships so that we can build a just, equitable and more unified tomorrow. Reconciliation must be based on a foundation of trust, truth and honesty regarding our past. Expecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Peoples to ignore or look past the significance of Australia Day and what it has meant for them is simply inconsistent with reconciliation.                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , To recognize and heal, action must be taken and changes made. A date change is as necessary as it is straightforward. So straightforward, in fact, we've done it several times in the past. Over the last century, there have been various dates celebrating "Australia Day,' including on July 30 in 1915 as part of World War I fundraising efforts. It wasn't until 1994 that January 26 became a national public holiday.                                                                                                  , While we cannot change history, we must address how we deal with this day in a respectful way. Australia is not alone in this. We watch with interest as Columbus Day, a day that celebrates the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, is now being negotiated in the United States. A growing number of US states and cities have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, a holiday meant to honor the culture and history of the people living in the Americas both before and after Columbus' arrival., In mainstream Australia, we've also seen this change unfolding. A growing number of local councils recognize January 26 is not a national holiday all Australians can celebrate. Companies are offering employees flexibility regarding working on January 26. And it doesn't get more mainstream than when Cricket Australia removed the words, "Australia Day," from branding cricket matches on that day.                                                                                                                   , Reconciliation Australia's bi-annual Australian Reconciliation Barometer shows these actions mirror changing community attitudes, with support for moving the date continuing to grow. The barometer also shows close to 90% of the general  community understand we must tell and accept the truth of our history to move forward.                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , More than 230 years after the first fleet's arrival, the ongoing impact of the events of January 26, 1788, can be seen and felt in Australia across many fronts, including disturbing rates of incarceration of First Nations peoples; the growing over-representation of Indigenous children in out-of-home care; the huge disparities in health outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and the non-resolution of issues of sovereignty, land and representation.                                            , No treaty was ever signed with Australia's Indigenous peoples; no recognition ever given to our existence. January 26 cannot serve as a unifying date; not now or in the future, as more and more Australians in the wider community come to understand and respond to the truth of our history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , This year, we are once again asking all Australians to have brave conversations with family, friends and colleagues about how we celebrate January 26, and to reflect on the benefits of a new date for a truly unifying national day of reflection and celebration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

Revenue also topped estimates, and 3M said its business improved during December as supply chain issues, omicron and other concerns abated.                                                                         , Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) – Johnson &amp; Johnson beat estimates by a penny a share, with quarterly earnings of $2.13 per share. The company gave an upbeat full-year forecast, however fourth-quarter revenue came in below analysts' forecasts.

Powell, to signal changes well in advance so as not to surprise markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , No matter, there’s no question that investors have become unsettled by the idea that interest rates will rise this year. Higher rates can slow the economy, making borrowing for houses, cars and business costs more expensive. They also discourage investors from bidding up risky assets like stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Part of Wall Street’s concern is that the Fed has room to be aggressive in its fight against inflation because the Omicron variant of the coronavirus appears, by some measures, to be less severe than previous forms. Minutes from the central bank’s December meeting, which it published early in January, also showed that the Fed had discussed moving with more urgency.

which in many ways is more closely tied to the Fed and the economy in general, appears to be taking the current moment in stride.

drop.

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, for instance, was basically unchanged on Tuesday, and had fallen only slightly in the past week to 1.78 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “The bond market is not willing to move decisively in one direction or another because the economy is still in pretty good shape,” said Vincent Deluard, a strategist at StoneX Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , That’s not to say investors and the economy aren’t facing some risks. Disruptions are slowing output at factories, companies are struggling to find workers, and rising prices will eat into consumer demand. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund reduced its estimate for global growth to 4.4 percent from the 4.9 percent it projected just three months ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The I.M.F. still expects the U.S. economy to grow 4 percent this year, but that would be slower than in 2021. The fund said the failure of the Biden administration’s $2.2 trillion social policy package and the Fed’s tighter monetary policy were among the reasons it had reduced the growth forecast for the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The recent concern about the Fed is also colliding with earnings reporting season, with some of the biggest companies in the S&amp;P 500 scheduled to update investors on the state of their businesses and their outlook for the year. Because of their size, those companies — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla — can influence the direction of market indexes like the benchmark S&amp;P 500, which they lifted higher as they rose to astronomical valuations in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , This month, all five of those stocks have dropped at least 10 percent, pulling the broad market benchmark lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , On Tuesday, Microsoft reported sales and profits that were higher than analysts had expected. Its shares still fell more than 5 percent in after-hours trading, suggesting that investors were still disappointed in aspects of Microsoft’s report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Tesla will report results on Wednesday, Apple on Thursday, and Amazon and Alphabet next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , It hasn’t all been bad news for company earnings.

provide workers who are recovering from the coronavirus, or are caring for infected family members, with as much as two weeks of supplemental paid sick leave, under a deal announced on Tuesday by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders in the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The agreement would reinstate a benefit passed by the state in 2021 that expired at the end of September. It was sought by organized labor as the Omicron variant surged, but employers opposed it, saying the benefit would be prohibitively expensive for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The state legislature is expected to fast-track a bill to turn the agreement into law. If it is approved, the paid leave requirement would apply to eligible absences between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 at companies with more than 25 employees. The bill would also restore some business tax credits to help companies absorb the cost of the additional paid time off.

requires employers to offer a minimum of three paid sick days a year. When the pandemic hit, the state raised that requirement, exploiting state and federal laws and tax credits to add up to 80 hours of paid sick leave for workers who were infected or were caring for infected relatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , That expansion was allowed to lapse Sept. 30 after the state reopened, but the advent of new surges in cases prompted calls from labor unions to reinstate it. Businesses struggling with staffing shortages protested that the eligibility threshold for paid time off was too lax, and that giving employees more paid sick leave deterred some from getting vaccinated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Legislative officials said the new version would, if passed, require employers to offer up to 40 hours of paid sick leave to full-time workers, and extend that by 40 more hours if the worker supplies proof of a positive coronavirus test result. The requirement for part-time workers would be the number of hours the worker typically worked in a week, to start with, and then that same amount again if the worker tests positive.

As early as 2015 and as late as 2019, Fashion Nova automatically posted four- and five-star reviews to its site but did not approve or publish hundreds of thousands of lower-starred, more negative reviews, according to the complaint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Terry Fahn, a spokesman for Fashion Nova, said in an emailed statement that the F.T.C. allegations were “inaccurate” and that the company was “highly confident that it would have won in court and only agreed to settle the case to avoid the distraction and legal fees that it would incur in litigation.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , While e-commerce has boomed, particularly during the pandemic, the ecosystem of online reviews remains relatively crude. The F.T.C. has sought to police companies like the skin-care brand Sunday Riley for posting fake reviews online in recent years, though this is the first instance of the agency’s challenging “review suppression.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , These actions by the F.T.C. tend to act as warning signals to other companies. The agency said on Tuesday that it had sent letters to 10 companies that offer review management services, telling them that they cannot avoid collecting and publishing negative reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Fashion Nova said that the issue was caused by its reliance on a vendor and a complication involving an “autopublish” feature for certain star ratings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Reviews that were not autopublished could be individually moderated and manually released. “At one point in time, the company inadvertently failed to complete this process given certain resource constraints during a period of rapid growth,” Mr. Fahn said. He said that Fashion Nova resolved the issue once it was made aware of it in 2019 and that the unpublished reviews had since been posted.

justices in dissent, said the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, did not have the authority to require workers to be vaccinated for coronavirus or tested weekly, describing the agency’s approach as “a blunt instrument.” The mandate would have applied to some 80 million people if it had not been struck down.

Labor Department’s decision to withdraw the rule means that the outstanding legal proceedings will be dropped. The case was headed back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati for further consideration, though that court most likely would have followed the Supreme Court’s lead and struck it down.

vaccine-or-test standard forward through its official rule-making process, such as one focused on high-hazard industries like meatpacking, but that would likely still face legal challenges, according to David Michaels, a former OSHA administrator and a professor at George Washington University.

      , Without the Labor Department’s standard in effect, employers are subject to a patchwork of state and local laws on Covid-19 workplace safety, with places like New York City requiring vaccine mandates and other governments banning them.

faces multiple challenges as the pandemic enters its third year. The Omicron variant has led to renewed mobility restrictions in many countries and increased labor shortages. Supply disruptions still weigh on activity and are contributing to higher inflation, adding to pressures from strong demand and elevated food and energy prices. Moreover, record debt and rising inflation constrain the ability of many countries to address renewed disruptions. We project global growth this year at 4.4 percent, which is 0.5 percentage point lower than previously forecast, mainly because of downgrades for the United States and China. Now, in the case of the United States, this reflects lower prospects of legislating the Build Back Better fiscal package and earlier withdrawal of extraordinary monetary accommodation, and continued supply disruptions. China’s downgrade reflects continued retrenchment of the real estate sector and a weaker than expected recovery in private consumption. We expect global growth to slow to 3.8 percent in 2023. Now the forecast is subject to high uncertainty and risks overall are to the downside. The emergence of deadlier variants could prolong the crisis. China’s zero-Covid strategy could exacerbate global supply disruptions, and a financial stress in the country’s real estate sector spreads through the broader economy. The ramifications would be felt widely. Higher inflation surprises in the U.S. could elicit aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve and sharply tightened global financial conditions.

of the world’s growth in recent years, the I.M.F. pointed to the collapse of the real estate sector and the zero-Covid policy that has restricted travel, shut businesses and reduced consumption.

With the pandemic entering its third year, a note of pessimism underlay the report. “Risks overall are to the downside,” Gita Gopinath, the first managing deputy director, said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Global economic losses related to the pandemic will total $13.8 trillion by the end of 2024, Ms. Gopinath estimated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The dimmed economic prospects come at a time when governments have less room to maneuver in how they spend their money. Debt levels have soared over the past two years as countries struggled with the health crisis caused by the pandemic and funneled aid to their citizens. Public spending is unlikely to reach the same levels in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The troubling rise in inflation that has doubled heating costs in much of Europe and made food less affordable in places like sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil has also lasted longer than anticipated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The pandemic has changed the way people in many parts of the world spend their money, shifting funds that might have been used for dining, travel and entertainment to goods they can play with, sit on or consume at home. That increased demand, combined with persistent difficulties in moving goods from one city or continent to another, skyrocketing energy prices and labor shortages, has driven up costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Some of those pressures are expected to wane toward the end of the year — but not everywhere. “In the United States the story is different,” the fund noted. The exit of so many people from their jobs has created more persistent labor shortages and driven up wages much more than in other countries. Americans’ high level of spending has also created some of the worst supply chain disruptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The U.S. Federal Reserve has made clear that its primary focus has shifted from stimulating the economy during the pandemic to fighting inflation. The bank, which is set to release its next policy statement on Wednesday, is raising interest rates and reeling in its purchases of bonds that ensured money would continue to flow through the economy. Other central banks, including those in Mexico and Brazil, are taking similar actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The strategy is to discourage people from borrowing money to buy a car or invest in a business and ratchet back demand for products that are in short supply. Creeping interest rates, though, risk not only slowing economic growth but burdening poorer nations with even bigger debts far into the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “If interest rates rise more sharply, that then puts extra strain on vulnerable developing countries which have most of their debt in dollars,” said Creon Butler, research director at Chatham House, a London research organization. That means governments must use scarce resources to repay bulging loans instead of adding hospital beds or feeding hungry children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The slowdown in China, which is both a major supplier and buyer of goods traded with other countries, is also setting off reverberations around the world. The once exuberant real estate market has plunged. The government has imposed the world’s most stringent restrictions and lockdowns to contain Covid, and unexpected power outages have further hindered industrial production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Growth in the euro area was revised down 0.4 percentage points to 3.9 percent, but for some countries, the drop was much steeper. Clogs in the supply chain, especially those affecting the auto industry, prompted the I.M.F. to estimate that growth in Germany — the largest economy in Europe — would decline by 0.8 percentage points, twice as much as the average of all countries that use the euro.

chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the impact of this latest surge had not been as devastating: “We’re seeing evidence that Omicron is holding back economic activity, but nowhere near to the same extent as the virus did before.”

third-party trackers in Chrome with an online advertising system called Topics. The new system would still eliminate cookies, but it would inform advertisers of a user’s areas of interest — such as “fitness” or “autos and vehicles” — based on the last three weeks of the user’s web browsing history. The Topics will be kept for three weeks before they are deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Google’s plan to eliminate cookies by the end of next year is a potentially huge shift for the digital advertising industry, though it is not clear if the new method, which the company will start testing in the first quarter this year, will be any less alarming to advertisers and regulators. Google Chrome, the world’s most widely used web browser, is used by two of every three people surfing the internet, according to StatCounter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Google said in 2019 that it would do away with third-party trackers in Chrome through an initiative called the Privacy Sandbox. The trackers allow ad services to follow users around the web to learn about their browsing habits. The company later unveiled a plan known as federated learning of cohorts, or FLoC. It was intended to allow advertisers to target groups of users, based on common browsing history, instead of individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Apple has also cracked down on advertisers, limiting their ability to track users as they browse the web. Last year, the company introduced App Tracking Transparency, which allows users to block apps from tracking them, a decision that caused concern at Facebook and other major advertisers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Since marketers rely heavily on cookies to target ads and measure their efficacy, Google’s privacy proposal led to worries that it would strengthen the company’s hold on the industry because Google already knows so much about the interests and habits of its users. Privacy experts feared that the cohorts could expose users to new forms of tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Google’s proposal also caught the eye of regulators. The European Union said it was investigating the plan as part of an inquiry into Google’s role in the digital advertising market. Last year, Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority reached an agreement with Google to allow the regulator to review changes to trackers in Chrome as part of a settlement of another investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Topics will address some of the concerns raised by privacy advocates about FLoC, preventing more covert tracking techniques, Google said. It aims to preserve user privacy by segmenting its audience into larger groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Google said there had been tens of thousands of potential cohorts under the previous plan, but that it would reduce the number of Topics to fewer than a few thousand. The company said users would be able to see what topics were associated with them, and remove them if they chose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “It’s slightly more privacy-protective than FLoC,” said Sara Collins, a senior policy counsel at the public interest nonprofit Public Knowledge. The larger topic groups would grant users more anonymity, but Google’s plan could still be circumvented by fingerprinting techniques meant to track individual users, she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Google said Topics would use human curators rather than allow machine learning technology to generate user groups, as the FLoC plan did. This will eliminate the possibility that groups might be based on sensitive characteristics like sexual orientation or race, Google said.

In 2019, the company gave users the ability to set up their search history to automatically purge every three or 18 months. That made it harder for advertisers to target individuals with highly personalized ads based on their web traffic. Google also gave users the ability to disable it from recording search histories altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Critics noted that the privacy controls were ineffective because they were difficult for the average person to find, and by default, Google continues to keep a permanent record of people’s search histories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , By Michael M.

(His running mate, Dick Cheney, was overheard affirming Mr. Bush’s observation: “big time.”)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , During his vice presidency in 2010, Mr. Biden was heard using an expletive to convey to President Barack Obama that the signing of the Affordable Care Act was a big deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , No accident was required for Americans to hear the insults lobbed by former President Donald J. Trump at his interlocutors in the press. Mr. Trump deemed Jim Acosta of CNN “a rude, terrible person,” called Jonathan Karl of ABC “a disgrace,” and said April Ryan, now of TheGrio, was a “loser,” to name but three examples. Among other moments, Mr. Trump once mocked the physical disabilities of a Times reporter to entertain his supporters at a campaign rally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , On Monday, Mr. Doocy shouted his question after Mr. Biden finished brief remarks at the start of a cabinet meeting focused on increasing the country’s economic competitiveness. When another journalist yelled out a query about Ukraine, Mr. Biden briefly complained that the reporters should ask questions about the topic at hand rather than about unrelated foreign policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Doocy, who along with the rest of the press corps was being led out of the room by White House staff members, pivoted to an economic query. Mr. Biden, who was still seated, appeared not to realize that the microphone in front of him was still broadcasting audio.

couldn’t even hear him because people were shouting at us to get out,” he said.

served as White House press secretary under Mr. Bush, told Mr. Doocy that he should embrace the moment. “You might even have a book title,” she joked.

                  , Last week, at another White House event, Mr. Biden expressed frustration with another Fox News reporter, Jacqui Heinrich, who had shouted out a question about the president’s approach to the tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

At first, the production had been able to keep going by flying in alumni from its Broadway run, but ultimately the number of company members testing positive was just too high, so earlier this month the show decided to cancel its remaining shows in Tulsa, and then postponed the runs that would have followed in two Wisconsin cities, Madison and Appleton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , When the show hit the pause button, Jonalyn Saxer, the actress playing Karen Smith, found herself with two weeks off and no home of her own — like many actors, she gave up her New York apartment and put her stuff in storage when she signed on to tour. The show offered to fly her wherever she wanted to go, and she chose her parents’ house in Los Angeles.

we’re the only people wearing masks,” she said. “It’s very stressful — I’m not going to lie.

The shows bring in a lot of money: those featuring union actors (there are also tours with nonunion casts) grossed $1.6 billion at the box office in 2018-2019, which was the last full season before the pandemic; that’s just slightly less than the $1.8 billion spent by theatergoers attending Broadway shows in New York City during the same period, according to the Broadway League.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , There appear to be several reasons the touring audience has remained more stable than the Broadway audience. Most of the venues that present touring productions depend on locals, rather than visitors, so they are less vulnerable to the drop in tourism that has walloped Broadway. Many of the touring venues have large numbers of subscribers who, remarkably, retained their subscriptions throughout the pandemic. And some venues are in parts of the country where residents have been less inclined to make changes to their routines because of Covid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “There’s a huge difference between New York and the audience on the road,” said Rich Jaffe, a co-chief executive of Broadway Across America, which presents Broadway tours in 48 North American markets. “On the road, they consider these venues their theaters — it’s a big part of their communities, supporting jobs and creating economic ripple effects for local downtowns that are quite significant. If we have a show, the audience is there.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Many North American tours are bypassing Canada because of government-mandated capacity restrictions there. But in the United States, where there are generally no capacity limits, venue operators seem pleased with how things are going, despite the bumpiness of Omicron.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “We’ve already presented five weeks of touring Broadway, and we’ve had great attendance — our audiences are showing up enthusiastically,” said Joan H. Squires, the president of Omaha Performing Arts, which hosted touring productions of “Cats” and “Hamilton” in the fall and then “Dear Evan Hansen” in the days before and after the New Year’s holiday. Squires wound up scanning tickets at the door for “Dear Evan Hansen” because too few volunteer ushers were available, but she attributed that more to winter weather than Covid concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The biggest brand names, as always, are selling the strongest. And “Hadestown,” which won the Tony Award for best musical in 2019 and began its tour in October, is starting strong. “‘Hadestown’ arrived just as we were starting to see Omicron spike, and it far exceeded our targets for attendance and sales,” said Maria Van Laanen, the president and chief executive of Fox Cities Performing Arts Center in Appleton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Presenters in some cities describe a softening of sales as Omicron hit. “We certainly noticed a slower pattern of buying over the holidays — in any other year, we would have been completely sold out, but that obviously wasn’t the case because there was some hesitancy,” said Jeffrey Finn, the vice president of theater producing and programming at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. “That said, I’m watching a big upturn as we head toward the spring with the hope and expectation that Omicron won’t be as present.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Safety precautions vary across the country. Most shows are requiring that audiences wear masks, except in cities where such requirements are barred; vaccination rules for audiences follow local government protocols (actors and other theater workers are required to be vaccinated).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Keeping tours going has required shows to add staff members. “Hamilton” now employs seven “universal swings,” who are versatile performers ready to travel anywhere they are needed to fill in, up from four before the pandemic; “The Lion King” has brought in three additional swings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “Come From Away” offers a particularly vivid case study in the creativity also required to keep shows afloat. The company got hit by Covid earlier this month as it arrived in Minneapolis, where it was scheduled to spend two weeks.

producers canceled three performances, which bought them enough time to bring in actors from California, New York and Toronto, and the show then resumed with a blended cast that included alumni not only from Broadway but also from productions in Australia, Canada and Britain.

He thinks the Fed now runs the risk of having to pull support away so rapidly that it disrupts markets and the economy.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Royal Mail plans to cut around 700 management jobs as it tries to reduce costs amid growing competition from rivals.                                                                                                                                                                        , The move, part of a restructuring plan, comes as the firm faces heavy criticism over ongoing postal delays.                                                                                                                                                                                 , The company has been struggling to cope with Covid-related staff absences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Those have led to severe delays in some areas and the regulator, Ofcom, has said it may impose fines where services have fallen short.                                                                                                                                                      , Some customers have complained of waiting up to a month for important deliveries, including prescriptions and legal documents as well as late Christmas cards.                                                                                                                              , Ofcom said recently that it was "concerned about these delays and have made it clear to Royal Mail that it must take steps to improve its performance as the effects of the pandemic subside".                                                                                              , Large parts of London, Manchester, Hertfordshire, Wales and Scotland, have been particularly affected by the delays.                                                                                                                                                                        , In early January, around 15,000 - or more than one in 10 - of Royal Mail's staff were off sick or isolating. But Simon Thompson, who took over as chief executive of the delivery firm a year ago, said the situation was now improving.                                                    , Mr Thompson said absences had been "a headwind" in delivering productivity targets. Between April and December last year the firm had spent more than £340m on overtime, additional temporary staffing and sick pay, he said.                                                               , Royal Mail said the latest planned job cuts would incur a charge of £70m but would deliver annual savings of around £40m.                                                                                                                                                                   , The company axed a fifth of its managers - around 2,000 posts - in June 2020, shortly after the start of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                      , Royal Mail has seen deliveries particularly hard hit by staff sickness and absences with the advent of Omicron, with around one in eight staff affected over the Christmas period. But even before that, it had repeatedly failed to meet delivery targets.                                 , With pressure from customers, the regulator and shareholders for more efficient operations, Royal Mail is undertaking an overhaul. And its managers will bear the brunt.                                                                                                                    , The company says that losing 700 posts will enable it to streamline its structure and improve local performance and ultimately, save £40m per year.  It will now have to consult unions on the proposals.                                                                                   , In the first year of the pandemic Royal Mail saw rising demand for its services as people switched to shopping online at home.                                                                                                                                                              , Over the past year, with High Street stores open again, that demand has fallen back, but Royal Mail's chairman Keith Williams said the trend for higher numbers of parcels being delivered remained.                                                                                        , The volume of domestic parcels being delivered by Royal Mail between October and December was 33% above pre-pandemic levels in 2019, but 7% lower than in 2020. However, the number of letters Royal Mail handled in the October to December period declined compared to both 2020 and 2021., Royal Mail said it believed it was retaining its share of the deliveries market, although it saw a slower than expected pick-up around the Black Friday shopping period.                                                                                                                    , "The past few months have demonstrated that the challenge for Royal Mail is to improve both quality and efficiency," Mr Williams said.                                                                                                                                                      , Price rises in the UK and elsewhere have raised costs for both its domestic and international businesses, Royal Mail said.                                                                                                                                                                  , "Looking forwards, the delivery of our transformation and modernisation plans remain incredibly important in light of the fast‐paced change we are seeing and ongoing inflationary pressures."                                                                                              , Royal Mail also said that as government guidance over Covid-19 changed, there would be fluctuations in the number of Covid tests it would be delivering.                                                                                                                                    , The firm agreed in December to double deliveries of tests to a total of 900,000 a day, including both PCR and lateral flow tests. Over the nine months to the end of last year, Covid tests accounted for between 4% and 6% of Royal Mail's parcel volumes.                                 , How one ship triggered a global crisis...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Why were chances missed to catch serial killer Dennis Nilsen?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , © 2022 BBC.

Meanwhile, recent rains in Argentina have limited crop losses after a prolonged drought since December. </td>

I can only guess that there will be a sell off until Jerome takes the mic to discuss the rate hikes we are expecting, then a run to the upside before close. So I’m bearish in the am and then bullish I’m the late afternoon going into the close. That is of course considering that we don’t have any news overnight that could potentially send us to the downside so much that we can’t recover before tomorrow close. Basically, I have no idea. </td>

Think about the games mm have been playing lately. Up down up down. If you truly think this is safe for the market you’re a full 

But more importantly we need a correction but i will say uvxy isn’t done. There’s more downside. If you don’t believe me look at 440 support level on $spy 

Market makers will inflict pain on both sides. You might as well chose one and sell when you’re time is right. You will get chances to get out of bad investments. </td>

Saying the recent drop in U.S. equities has created an &amp;quot;extremely oversold market,&amp;quot; widely followed analyst Thomas Lee argued Tuesday that the decline has created an attractive buying opportunity for stocks. 
 
&amp;quot;These are great entry points for people because you have so many stocks down,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I think people have to look at this as a very attractive opportunity in 2022.&amp;quot; 
 
Lee acknowledged that the stock market could retest its recent lows but the overall direction over the next six to 12 months will be higher. He warned that while today&amp;#39;s buyers might see further dips, those holding off on entering the stock market could miss a sudden step higher. 
 
&amp;quot;If [investors] are participating in this buyers&amp;#39; strike, the recovery can be violent. And then, they are going to miss, you know, potentially over three days 5%, 6%, 7% gains,&amp;quot; he said. 
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve priced in so much bad news, we&amp;#39;re at the apex of the fear,&amp;quot; he added.

This is a must read. If you want the gamma ramp that ignites MOASS to happen, buy long-dated call options with the highest delta you can afford. Also buy shares. The end is close.

They are simply there to fill orders and make money while they do it.   In order to to that, they balance the buy vs sell demand and liquidity dictates what direction they have to go to fill orders, to do that.  Find the liquidity and you will find the wave to ride.    You will be better off putting your effort into learning this versus complaining just to mask your own mistakes.   Study.  Get screen time, live and learn.   Now go get those bucks! </td>

And, let&amp;#39;s face it, you are counting on open world and 1st-person shooter games A DECADE OLD NOW to carry Microsoft Q1 as kids in school more + working more, having to, because of inflation eating their small-made dollars more than anyone else....

Q1 will be very, very bleak as companies are not worrying about operating in the cloud as they are with kerling up with inflation by working extra hours on planet Earth 🥶👌👍

MSFT counting on old antiquated PHONE games too for future REV, COD, Clash, Crush, not g ou of-not good.

God bless your trades .

The market&amp;#39;s direction in the next short while will be determined by Fedspeak tomorrow. If their language indicate that they are willing to hike gradually in light of covid, global turmoil and market turbulence, then the market will very likely rally higher given that it probably priced in much harsher fed actions.  
 
We believe the current market is pricing in 6-7 hikes over the next 2 years, if the feds indicate a more moderate hiking path, then it will go up, at least in the short term. </td>

Like free money for them. Having a quick V shape bounce is only good for retail because retails love trade. Big money like to hold long term.

Ultimately , what happens every time one of our big 5 reportzzzzzz?

OH, trust me it is no snoozer , it further embeds the FED&amp;#39;s thinking that extreme measures will be needed to curb growth.

Consumers hotly spending on Windows 10, Windows Server, etc. software + Cloud fueling businesses hotly.

THAT WAS A BAD ER for Powell holding off on a SURPRISE .25-.50% initial FED FUNDS POSITIVE RATE + there is an outside chance....

CPI + PPI + Housing Starts + weak but THERE Services data showing CONSUMER fighting FOOD DELIVERY INFLATION, and losing but still 60+ and you do know below 50 is recession so, for now, not even. close. to that. 👍😱🥶

Get ready for a face-ripping beguiling of your thinking, to the downside tom.

Microsoft about to EXPERIENCE what everyone else gone thru 👌

The Report, was irrelevant.  Then in AHs, I warned Retail not to position Bearish on the “response”.  That the CCall could turn the tide.  But, Retail bought AAPL Bearish Puts and posted their “Buys”.  Now,  so many are “off sides” in MSFT, going into tomorrow’s Open.  Today’s Close in AAPL, saw massive “Buy Side” positioning.  Trade smart.  The AAPL Board has been corrupted by HFUND Shills posting Bearish Misinformation Smack.  If you are a Conflicted Retail Trader”, just move to the sidelines.  Nothing wrong with taking a break.  Otherwise, don’t add to the Bearish Noise, when you are holding a Bearish Trade you really have no confidence in….  Such posts,    
just reveal an inexperienced Trader.  AH’s Volume, is massive.  Until, tomorrow! </td>

Q1 will be very, very bleak as companies are not worrying about operating in the cloud as they are with kerling up with inflation by working extra hours on planet Earth 🥶👌👍

I’m in shock of all the dummies that are bailing on quality companies like Apple and Microsoft and many other companies. Most will chase the dollar in less profitable companies. For all the real investors as you know it’s all about investing in profitable companies .Good luck real investors. PS their will be no surprises with the fed. They’ve been telling us for a year they were going to do so.  They need to do so to get inflation under control. </td>

A few &amp;quot;whale&amp;quot; accounts were driving the social momentum. This will be something to keep an eye on going into pre-market tomorrow.

They are all vying to increase users, subscriber etc. The population dirs not grow at the rate at which the market expects these companies to grow and then punishes retail for it. Also in this day and age when we want to reduce carbon emissions save the plant all these companies do is build more and more dates centres using  thousands of MW cooling and electrical power to satisfy this tech gready population. I love theses companies for their products, innovation etc, but at some point we all have to stand and be accountable. The planet cannot withstand third bombardment of tech and increased energy usage.

20 years ago we where extatic when our phone or PC had 64GB storage, now we have 1TB and still want to store it again in the cloud. People get a grip, save your planet. </td>

So, for a 2 TRILLION market cap co., that is a miss-miss. 👍

Still, after Apple and Amazon and FB all report, I think, Microsoft, who is in Redmond HQ&amp;#39;d and in western Washington,  my state, will be the #1 USA company, until this Q1 when their is a changing of the guard from TECH to ??? 

Do your own DD, that is what I remember reading yesterday.

1. $MSFT is down 1.5% on ER beat (fading AH)
2. FED tomorrow
3. VIX is sky high
4. Macro has been trending down

Did hit the $950 through the flood of short sells = strong but didn’t get the full squeeze ya know for split $2,000 strikes in weeks without climate bill BUT is expected in February +- usual old bank bs. 

Bears still on defense paying interest for heavy OI but makes for good cheap calls with bonus 🍋 🚀potentials. 

If BTDs hit $979 tomorrow and catch  Bullish wind 🍋 play. This weeks including AHs short sells covering would put range around the $1,080+ break eow or discounts for climate I think was $500 Billion..DD tho. 

+$200 or -$200 👉 only Bull work banks decent wages now..no fees👌

Watch Kevin admittedly converse with hay Dave (min 4) when asked about big capital gain Taxes with his answer clearly stating his big losses in his Portfolio the very stocks he recdmmmded to buy to his Discord followers with losses range anywhere between 40-60% leveraging his capital gains Taxes ! 

Question : how about these followers who don’t own Tesla but just the money losing stocks he recommended then bailed out !! ?!  

I normally don’t do this kinda posing but this is becoming common on YouTube and ppl sadly follow out of desperation!!! 

Be careful plz !!
