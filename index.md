   <td style="text-align:left;"> Zelensky calls for no-fly zone and harsher sanctions on Russia in Zoom meeting with US lawmakers - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told US lawmakers Saturday that his country urgently needs more assistance from the US, including the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as it fights against Russia's invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                           , During an hourlong Zoom meeting Saturday morning with members of Congress, Zelensky thanked the US for the support it has delivered so far, but called for more military support and greater sanctions on Russia, including on energy, according to a person familiar with the session.                                                                                                                                           , The Ukrainian leader advocated banning Russian oil imports and suspending all commercial transactions, like Visa and Mastercard, a senator on the call told CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Zelensky also implored the lawmakers to help Ukraine get more planes that Ukrainian pilots are trained in and can fly, according to the senator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Following the call, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Zelensky "made a desperate plea for Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine. These planes are very much needed."                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer," the New York Democrat said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska voiced his opposition to a no-fly zone in a statement after the call, saying the situation could "spiral out of control quickly." But he urged the US to send more air power.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Several senators took to Twitter to express their support for Zelensky and Ukraine. South Dakota's John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, praised the Ukrainian leader for his "inspiring bravery and resolve while under attack, just like his fellow countrymen." Thune said the US stands with Ukraine and "must help keep them in the fight while leading the free world against [Vladimir] Putin's war of conquest.", At the end of the call, dozens of lawmakers unmuted to thank Zelensky and voice their support, with some saying "Slava Ukraini," according to a person who was on the call. The Ukrainian President was clearly moved by the gesture, the person added.                                                                                                                                                                           , CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Lauren Fox, Veronica Stracqualursi and Eva McKend contributed to this report. </td>

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also reportedly angry at President Joe Biden for refusing to speak to him over his alleged involvement in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  (The Saudi government still denies the Crown Prince played any role in the journalist's death.)                                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Perhaps most complex is the case of Israel. One could be forgiven for thinking that as America's closest ally and the region's only democracy -- however flawed -- Israel's unwavering support for the Ukrainians would be given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But Israel's unique interests in the region are forcing Jerusalem to navigate a course that tries to avoid alienating both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Biden at the same time. As Putin's bloody campaign in Ukraine intensifies, however, Israel may find itself under greater pressure to take a harsher anti-Russia stance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Though Israel voted in favor of the UNGA resolution this week, it was preceded by a period of Israeli leaders' awkward maneuvering to avoid a harsh personal condemnation of Putin's invasion. On February 24, just after Russian troops stepped foot on Ukrainian soil, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called the invasion "a serious violation of international order" -- but he did not mention Putin's name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , More recently, in response to a Russian attack on Kyiv that struck in the vicinity of the Holocaust memorial at Babyn Yar, Lapid "denounced the damage," but failed to mention Russia was the perpetrator of the damage. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, reportedly seeking to play a mediating role in the crisis, has thus far avoided using the words "Putin," "Russia" and "condemn" in the same sentence. While he has said, "We are praying for the welfare of Ukraine's citizens and hope that additional bloodshed will be avoided," Bennett has only agreed to send humanitarian aid -- including medical equipment, water purifying systems, tents, blankets and sleeping bags -- at this point. ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky has asked the Israeli government to supply weapons too, but the Israelis have thus far demurred. On Thursday, the Ukrainian President, himself Jewish, urged Israel to take a stronger moral stand and offered some choice words for Bennett: "I don't feel that he is wrapped in the flag of Ukraine."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Israel's hesitancy on Ukraine is driven, in part, by a need to maintain day-to-day cooperation with Russia in Syria. The Russians, who control much of Syrian air space, have given Israel wide latitude to strike Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese targets in Syria. The arrangement involves a deconfliction mechanism that prevents accidental conflict between Russian and Israeli forces through a real-time communication channel. Add to that Israel's perennial concern about the well-being and security of the 150,000 Jews in Russia, and the argument in favor of maintaining good relations with Putin is a strong one.                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , At the same time, Israel has other critical interests to protect. As a state created as a safe haven for world Jewry in the wake of the Holocaust, Israel pays a price for appearing to waffle in the face of a predatory power preying on a weaker state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , According to Axios, the Biden administration has been understanding of Israel's need for balance, but it has also pressed Israel "to take a clear stance" -- arguing that this is a matter "of right and wrong." And surely Israelis know this is the most serious international crisis of Biden's presidency thus far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Perhaps Bennett seriously believes that by refraining from attacking Putin head-on, he'll maintain his putative role as an honest broker and mediator. But that wish will likely remain just that. While Bennett needs to protect Israel's interests, he also has another role to play as one of America's closest allies and as a democracy standing in the face of Russia's aggression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , As Putin's invasion claims more innocent lives, and the Ukraine crisis further threatens American, European and global interests, Bennett surely knows that Biden and many in the international community will expect Israel to act like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Russia's invasion of Ukraine has taken hundreds of lives on the battlefield and in the Ukrainian cities under bombardment. But internationally, it's also affecting everything from food security in Cairo to gas prices in California. It's pushed to the fore major geopolitical shifts and changed the way some of the globe's most prominent institutions work.                                                                                                                               , Here are four ways the world has changed in the 10 days since war returned to Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A shifting world order                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The invasion of Ukraine didn't usher in a new era of big power politics. It was the violent exclamation point confirming one of the most significant changes in the geopolitical world order since 9/11.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In the ensuing years, global terrorism consumed much of Western leaders' attention. Al Qaeda and ISIS were the enemies that needed countering. The Kremlin was no longer viewed as the same threat it once was -- so much so that, in 2012, President Barack Obama mocked then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney as out of touch for calling Russia the number-one geopolitical foe of the United States.                                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , By that time, Putin had already shown he was keen to upend the post-Cold War order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The former KGB intelligence officer took office in 2000 vowing to restore Russia's former glory, sometimes through military force. As prime minister in 1999, he launched an offensive in the Russian republic of Chechnya against separatist guerrillas. In 2008, the Kremlin invaded Georgia and recognized two breakaway republics in the country, which at the time was growing closer to Europe.                                                                                                   , Later, Putin's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- ostensibly as an ally in the war on terror -- earned him no favors with Western democracies, not least because of the credible reports of the Syrian dictator's decision to attack his own people with chemical weapons. Putin's decision to annex Crimea in 2014 and back separatists in eastern Ukraine led to sanctions and were roundly condemned. So too were Russia's alleged attempts to assassinate its enemies on foreign soil. , But Putin remained an important player and partner, albeit an unsavory one, for leaders from Washington to Warsaw during the 2010s. Russia was important factor in the fight against ISIS; Europe's main energy supplier; and helped negotiate major diplomatic pacts like the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Last week's invasion may have ended that. After a quarter century of the Western world dealing with Putin, he may have finally pushed the envelope and become a pariah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In response, the Western world has hit Russia with unprecedented sanctions that have crippled its financial institutions, sending its economy and the ruble into a tailspin, and even targeted Putin and some of his inner circle personally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been," the US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday in his State of the Union address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , A more unified Europe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Russia's invasion has also prompted the European Union to make security decisions that would have been unthinkable a few weeks ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Though the bloc has for years been one of the world's most powerful economic players, it had failed to turn that strength into equivalent geopolitical might. The EU has, historically, been divided over exactly how much central control Brussels should have over foreign policy. This has stood in the way of the EU's lofty global ambitions, as policy proposals were watered down in negotiations or simply vetoed.                                                                              , Europe's thinking on defense, security and foreign affairs has evolved light years in the matter of a few days. It is now waking up from a decades-long dream that the stability provided by an interconnected world would prevent war breaking out and that, should the worst happen, America would sort it out.                                                                                                                                                                                       , The shock of war returning to Europe has unified the EU's 27 member states. The bloc is now wielding its economic might for geopolitical purposes, targeting Russia with the strongest package of sanctions it has ever imposed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The bloc has, for the first time ever, provided finance to purchase weapons for Ukraine. Germany, which has for decades been averse to a militarized approach to foreign policy, is now taking part in arming Ukraine and boosting its own military spending in response to the invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "The crisis in Ukraine has shattered the illusion that security and stability in Europe comes for free," one senior European diplomat told CNN this week. "When there was no real threat, geopolitics seemed remote. Now there is a war on our border. Now we know we have to pay up and act together."                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A million people on the move                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , One million people fled their homes in the first seven days since Russia invaded Ukraine -- one of the fastest and largest migrations of humanity in recent memory. To put that in context, it took three months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013 when departures were at their highest.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , If fighting continues and, as one French source close to President Emmanuel Macron said, the worst is yet to come, Europe could face an unprecedented refugee crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one," said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , There have also been multiple reports of racism against people of color and non-Ukrainians at the border.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The future of the refugees remains unclear. If Russia topples the democratically elected Ukrainian government, will these people want to return home? And what if, after the fighting, they no longer have homes to return to?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Food and fuel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Gas prices in the United States have made their biggest hikes since after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Experts are worried that food prices could spike after already "sharply" rising last year. And Moody's is warning that global supply chains, already hammered by the Covid-19 pandemic, could be further thrown into chaos. Stocks around the world fell on Friday, with Europe taking a particularly rough beating.                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The fighting in Ukraine has had economic and human costs across the globe, especially when it comes to energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Though Europe has said for years it needs to wean itself off Russian energy, Moscow is the EU's biggest supplier of oil and natural gas. Europe could survive if Russia shut off the supply, but it wouldn't be cheap or easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The conflict is also a pocketbook issue that could determine whether families can put food on the table. In Ukraine alone, three to five million people are going to need food support immediately, World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But Russia and Ukraine are also some of the world's leading producers of wheat. Together, they account for 23% of all global exports, according to S&amp;P Global.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Fears of conflict hanging over two of the world's major suppliers are clearly going to have some impact on prices, when there is already a sense of shortage," said Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council of Foreign Affairs.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Though Ukraine is dubbed the breadbasket of Europe, concerns are particularly acute in the Middle East -- Kyiv's third-largest wheat buyer in the 2020/2021 market year, according to the US Department of Agriculture. More than 40% of the country's recent wheat exports went to the Middle East or Africa alone.                                                                                                                                                                                    , CNN's Luke McGee, Matt Egan, Chris Isidore, Nadeen Ebrahim and Eoin McSweeney contributed to this report </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, volatility is set to stay with energy markets remaining in chaos and many companies taking a hit due to their exposure to Russia. Also, investors will be looking for European Central Bank monetary policy decision and macroeconomic projections. On the macro front, the spotlight will be taken by inflation and foreign trade data for China and the US, and January GDP figures for the UK </td>

Back in 2005, just as low-cost Chinese manufacturers were taking over the personal protective equipment industry, Bowen joined a friend who had started a small surgical mask company called Prestige Ameritech. The plan was to market his company’s masks to American hospitals and distributors as a way to provide resilience — a means of ensuring domestic supply if the supply chain ever broke down.                                                                                                                                                         , “Every company had left America,” he recalled recently. “The entire U.S. mask supply was under foreign control.” He remembers warning customers, “If there’s a pandemic, we’re going to be in trouble.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , At first, Bowen’s sales pitch wasn’t very successful. But in 2009, the swine flu virus caused a mask shortage in the United States. Suddenly, Prestige Ameritech had a lot of customers. “We went from 80 employees to 250,” Mr. Bowen says. “The phones were ringing off the hook. We thought, ‘People finally get it. We’re going to fix this problem.’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , He was wrong. As soon as the swine flu pandemic ended, the company’s new customers went right back to buying inexpensive masks from China; Chinese manufacturers soon controlled 90 percent of the American market. “The cost savings was like crack cocaine for American hospitals,” Mr. Bowen said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Even so, Mr. Bowen never stopped telling anyone who would listen that the offshoring of personal protective equipment — which includes nitrile gloves, hospital gowns and respirators, as well as surgical masks — would create big problems for the U.S. the next time it faced a pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Which, of course, is exactly what happened. Just weeks into the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the supply chain for protective equipment had broken down, creating severe shortages that cost lives. A black market emerged, full of con men and get-rich-quick schemers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A handful of U.S. entrepreneurs decided they would do their part by manufacturing masks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In Miami, a family-owned surgical device company, DemeTech, spent several million dollars to expand its facilities, build machines and hire hundreds of employees; by the fall of 2020, it was capable of churning out five million masks a day, according to Luis Arguello Jr., vice president of the company. “We took a risk as a family,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In Houston, Diego Olmos, a manufacturing expert who had recently left a multinational company, used his severance to help start a mask-making company called Texas Medplast. “My business partner and I said, ‘This is the right thing to do,’” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In Lindon, Utah, an entrepreneur named Paul Hickey helped found PuraVita Medical to make KN95 respirators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , It is hard to know precisely how many of these companies were born during the pandemic; 36 of them are members of the American Mask Manufacturer’s Association, which they formed to lobby Washington. Virtually all experienced the same boom and bust phenomenon that Mr. Bowen had in 2009. At first, customers who could no longer obtain masks through their normal supply channels were beating down their doors. The same was true during the Delta and Omicron waves, when masks were also scarce.                                                                                                                                                            , But as soon as the waves crested, and Chinese companies, determined to regain their market share, began exporting masks below cost, the customers disappeared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “All the hospitals and government agencies and retailers that had been begging for American products suddenly said, ‘We’re good,’” said Mr. Hickey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Today, these small U.S. mask manufacturers are in dire straits — if they haven’t gone out of business already. DemeTech has laid off nearly all the employees it hired to make masks, and it has shut most of its mask manufacturing center. Mr. Olmos, his severance long gone, expects Texas MedPlast to be out of business soon barring a miracle. And PuraVita Medical? “We’re on the verge of losing it all,” Mr. Hickey told me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The government’s answer to this pattern is its own buying power. During his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Biden promised that the government would begin to rigorously enforce provisions in the law that call for the federal agencies to buy American-made goods whenever possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails” would be made in America, he vowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The pandemic sparked the problem. The highly intricate and interconnected global supply chain is in upheaval. Much of the crisis can be traced to the outbreak of Covid-19, which triggered an economic slowdown, mass layoffs and a halt to production. Here’s what happened next:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A reduction in shipping. With fewer goods being made and fewer people with paychecks to spend at the start of the pandemic, manufacturers and shipping companies assumed that demand would drop sharply. But that proved to be a mistake, as demand for some items would surge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Demand for protective gear spiked. In early 2020, the entire planet suddenly needed surgical masks and gowns. Most of these goods were made in China. As Chinese factories ramped up production, cargo vessels began delivering gear around the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Then, a shipping container shortage. Shipping containers piled up in many parts of the world after they were emptied. The result was a shortage of containers in the one country that needed them the most: China, where factories would begin pumping out goods in record volumes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Demand for durable goods increased. The pandemic shifted Americans’ spending from eating out and attending events to office furniture, electronics and kitchen appliances – mostly purchased online. The spending was also encouraged by government stimulus programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Strained supply chains. Factory goods swiftly overwhelmed U.S. ports. Swelling orders further outstripped the availability of shipping containers, and the cost of shipping a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles skyrocketed tenfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Labor shortages. Businesses across the economy, meanwhile, struggled to hire workers, including the truck drivers needed to haul cargo to warehouses. Even as employers resorted to lifting wages, labor shortages persisted, worsening the scarcity of goods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Component shortages. Shortages of one thing turned into shortages of others. A dearth of computer chips, for example, forced major automakers to slash production, while even delaying the manufacture of medical devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A lasting problem. Businesses and consumers reacted to shortages by ordering earlier and extra, especially ahead of the holidays, but that has placed more strain on the system. These issues are a key factor in rising inflation and are likely to last through 2022 — if not longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The plight of these small mask companies, however, suggests that reviving American manufacturing — even when the underlying rationale is national security — won’t be easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Resilience is the byword of the day,” said Marc Schessel, a hospital supply chain expert who is working to develop alternative supply chains for personal protective equipment. And resilience — that is, creating extra manufacturing capacity that can get the country through an emergency — is what the small mask makers say is their value to the country. Sure, they argue, a globalized, just-in-time supply chain for low-cost protective equipment is fine in ordinary times. But we’ve learned these past two years that the country needs domestic manufacturers if we hope to avoid terrible shortages during the next pandemic, and the one after that., But how do you create that resilience? The federal government spent $682 billion buying goods and services from contractors in 2020, according to Bloomberg Government. That’s the sum the Biden administration wants to use to buy American products. And while it’s hardly chump change, it’s only about 3 percent of America’s $21.5 trillion economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The mask manufacturers I interviewed for this article said the Biden administration had expressed interest in buying their masks, but it has yet to happen. Even if it did, it would be unlikely to put much of a dent into Chinese dominance. As Mr. Bowen put it in a recent email to the White House, “Hospitals drive the mask market.” Since their incentives are to reduce costs, he wrote, “Any plan that allows imported masks to cost less than U.S. made masks will result in a foreign government controlled U.S. mask supply — as currently exists.”                                                                                                      , To put it another way, the modern imperative of maximizing shareholder value will always put efficiency and cost over resilience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The mask manufacturers are a microcosm of a larger problem. Today, there are shortages that go well beyond personal protective equipment. Things as diverse as semiconductors and garage doors are in short supply — all products whose manufacturing was offshored during the past decades as American companies embraced just-in-time supply chains and inexpensive foreign labor. Economists and corporate executives ignored resilience, and now the country doesn’t have a clear idea how to create it, even as its necessity has become obvious.                                                                                                                , Mr. Bowen told me that the problem for small U.S. mask manufacturers could be solved by either banning imported masks or putting hospitals on notice that they would be legally liable if their purchases of imported masks meant they could not protect their staff or patients in a future emergency. He also acknowledged that neither situation was realistic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Early in the pandemic, in a move intended to ensure access to essential supplies during crises, the Japanese government earmarked $2.3 billion in subsidies to companies that moved manufacturing to Japan from China. The U.S. federal government could take a similar tack, which would allow U.S. mask manufacturers to match Chinese prices. The problem is that if the government subsidized every vital product that required supply chain resilience, it would get awfully expensive.                                                                                                                                                                          , Despite the president’s vow to have the government buy American, the most likely scenario remains what it has been for months: the small mask manufacturers will go out of business, hospitals will continue to import Chinese masks — and the country will again be caught short when the next pandemic arrives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , What do you think? Should the government do more to protect American manufacturers of essential supplies? What would be most effective?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a series of threats against Ukraine and Western powers Saturday, as Ukrainian officials accused Russia of shelling evacuation routes out of two battered cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Ukrainian authorities said thousands of civilians remained trapped in the southeastern cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha and accused Russian forces of breaching an agreement to pause fire to allow safe passage out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Putin, meanwhile, used a meeting with Russian flight crew members at an Aeroflot training center in Moscow, to make his first expansive remarks since the invasion nine days ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they put under question the future of Ukrainian statehood," Putin said.

His solution to avoid Russia’s censors: digital ads, which he and a team of volunteers began buying with automated technology and slipping past government filters onto online platforms in Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Bearing neutral headlines such as, “What is known about the situation in Ukraine at the moment,” the ads were viewed two million times as of midday Friday and directed viewers 42,000 times to independent news sources such as the BBC, Mr. Blackie said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “The great thing about digital advertising is that it’s quite hard to stop it,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Pushback against the Russian assault has played out prominently in the form of economic sanctions, company exits and widespread moral outrage. But as President Vladimir V. Putin continues his advance into Ukraine, advertising has become another vehicle of protest: in commercials squeezed in the margins of news coverage, in subtle tweaks to brand names and marketing campaigns, in agencies leaving Russia and in attempts to counteract the misinformation splashed across online banners with more accurate messaging.                                                                                                        , Marla Kaplowitz, the chief executive of 4A’s, an advertising trade group, said the industry has done far more to respond to Russia’s attack compared with past crises. Marketing organizations have galvanized around addressing misinformation, with a 100-person conference call on the situation on Thursday and another meeting on Friday, she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “We see the industry trying to figure out what to do, because people feel a bit helpless, like putting out a statement just doesn’t feel like enough right now,” she said. “The whole world is reacting in a different way, rallying around Ukraine — it’s not enough to just say something, you actually have to do something.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Almost immediately after Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24, brands began producing symbolic expressions of solidarity. E-sports teams, productivity apps, health care companies, crypto services, ad giants and other organizations changed their logos to reflect the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The Ad Council, a nonprofit known for its public service campaigns featuring Smokey Bear and McGruff the Crime Dog, began running a campaign online and on billboards on Thursday directing viewers to donate to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund. The British price comparison website Compare the Market removed ads featuring its popular 13-year-old mascot, an animated meerkat portrayed as a Russian oligarch named Aleksandr Orlov.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Wargaming, an online game developer based in Cyprus, stripped its advertising of images of tanks and combat vehicles and focused instead on in-game narratives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Ads also became a front in the information war, as efforts to share verified news and solicit help clashed with Russia’s push to spread falsehoods and censor independent reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Twitter temporarily paused ads in Ukraine and Russia so that the ads did not distract from public safety information. Facebook’s parent company Meta said it was blocking Russian state media from advertising or monetizing on its platform. Google suspended advertising from Russian state media on YouTube; Snap halted ad sales in Russia and its ally, Belarus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , On Friday, Russia blocked Facebook inside the country, as part of the Kremlin’s broadening campaign to tighten control of the internet and limit spaces for dissent about the war in Ukraine. The move could foreshadow further restrictions against other tech companies such as Google, which owns YouTube, and Twitter. Facebook said it would pause ad targeting capabilities in Russia and prevent advertisers in the country from running ads on the platform.                                                                                                                                                                       , Before those restrictions, one digital ad agency tried to rally advertising professionals to participate in “the most important brief ever,” with the goal of stopping a potential world war. Through its Prevent WW3 project, ISD Group solicited marketing campaigns that would raise money for Ukrainian refugees, encourage peacekeepers to protect Ukraine, inform Russians about the war and persuade companies to leave Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Examples so far have included small efforts such as posters and digital ads, but also complex initiatives such as one from a creative director in San Francisco who is trying to persuade American bars and restaurants to expand their menus with Molotov cocktails — drinks accompanied by stories about the Ukrainian bartenders who submitted recipes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The ad agency DDB Germany was working on a broader campaign about press censorship called “Truth Wins” when its client, the nonprofit group Reporters Without Borders, asked it to quickly craft a response to Russian efforts to stanch information flow about Ukraine. The agency came up with a plan to collect censored articles about the war and mint them into the blockchain via Ethereum domain links, preventing them from being blocked by the Russian government.                                                                                                                                                              , But Madison Avenue was also skittish in some ways. Companies faced conflicting advice to pause marketing campaigns out of respect for Ukraine, but also to speak out in support of the country. Executives were pressured to pause their advertising campaigns and instead gift their marketing budgets to humanitarian aid organizations (though warnings circulated on social media about scammers pretending to collect donations for relief efforts).                                                                                                                                                                                  , Rising concerns. Russia’s attack on Ukraine has started reverberating across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes and spooking investors. The conflict could cause​​ dizzying spikes in prices for energy and food, and severely affect various countries and industries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The cost of energy. Oil prices already are the highest since 2014, and they have jumped as the conflict has escalated. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, providing roughly one of every 10 barrels the global economy consumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders have accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of reducing supplies to gain a political edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat and, together with Ukraine, accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports. In countries like Egypt and Turkey, that flow of grain makes up more than 70 percent of wheat imports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Wall-to-wall news coverage showing the smoking rubble of residential buildings and newborn infants in intensive care in a makeshift bomb shelter caused familiar fears to resurface for companies that had worried during the pandemic about how their advertising would be perceived alongside tragic news events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Within a week of Russia’s first attack, several ads had faced criticism, including an Applebee’s ad that appeared amid a CNN broadcast about air raid sirens in Kyiv.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Kylie Jenner, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star and beauty brand executive, faced accusations of being “tone deaf” when she posted an Instagram Story offering her “thoughts and prayers” to Ukrainians and followed it two hours later with a post promoting a lip shine product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Aggregator Show, an event in New Jersey geared to Amazon vendors, said it fired a worker who advertised the gathering by writing in a LinkedIn post that “while Russia is taking over Ukraine, we’re taking over the Amazon event industry.” The post ended with a taunt: “Whoever can’t handle it, take shelter.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “This is not who we are or what we are about,” the company said in a statement about the post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Afraid of stumbling into a similar scenario, some companies have begun blocking their ads from appearing next to news coverage about the crisis in Ukraine, brand safety specialists said. The precautions echo a rush in 2020 to avoid stories featuring words such as “coronavirus” and “pandemic,” although concerns about depriving publishers of critical advertising revenue has pushed many companies to evolve their blocking strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                          , “To put things into perspective, this is a real crisis situation that’s life or death for many people,” said Jason Lee, the senior vice president of digital and data strategy for Horizon Media. “What we’re doing in the advertising and media world is very important, but we also have to be mindful of this larger conflict occurring, and so it gets back to the question: Could a brand be part of the conversation, and should they?”                                                                                                                                                                                              , While advertising clients weighed their options, the agencies and industry organizations representing them offered support to their Ukrainian counterparts and shunned Russia. Accenture, which has a large marketing business, pulled out of Russia on Thursday. Organizers of Cannes Lions, the industry conference and competition scheduled for the summer in France, said on Friday that they would not accept submissions or delegations from Russia and would offer free passes to Ukrainian participants. Etsy, the online marketplace, said it was waiving advertising charges, along with other fees, for its sellers in Ukraine., But the two countries have a relatively small presence in the Western advertising world. Mark Read, the chief executive of the ad giant WPP, said during a conference call with investors on Feb. 24 that while Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine was “obviously a great concern to us,” the countries’ “economic impact on our business is not necessarily that great.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , On Friday, WPP discontinued its operations in Russia, where it has nearly 1,400 employees but draws less than 1 percent of its annual revenue. In a statement, it said that having an ongoing presence in a country responsible for the “horrific attack” on Ukraine “would be inconsistent with our values as a company.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Advertisement </td>

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the 19-year-old has spent hours each day scrolling the app for war videos, watching graphic footage of Ukrainian tanks firing on Russian troops and civilians running away from enemy gunfire.                                                                                                                                                                  , “What I see on TikTok is more real, more authentic than other social media,” said Ms. Hernandez, a student in Los Angeles. “I feel like I see what people there are seeing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But what Ms. Hernandez was actually viewing and hearing in the TikTok videos was footage of Ukrainian tanks taken from video games, as well as a soundtrack that was first uploaded to the app more than a year ago. The footage and soundtrack were traced back to their original sources in a New York Times analysis of the videos.                                                                                                                                                 , TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app known for viral dance and lip-syncing videos, has emerged as one of the most popular platforms for sharing videos and photos of the Russia-Ukraine war. Over the past week, hundreds of thousands of videos about the conflict have been uploaded to the app from across the world, according to a review by The Times. The New Yorker has called the invasion the world’s “first TikTok war.”                                                     , The surge has put TikTok in a challenging position. For the first time, it is dealing with moderating a flood of videos — many of them unverified — about a single event that has captivated a global audience. That is leading it to essentially confront a large scale of misleading and distorted information that has long bedeviled more mature social networks and video sites, such as YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.                                                         , Many popular TikTok videos of the invasion — including of Ukrainians livestreaming from their bunkers — offer real accounts of the action, according to researchers who study the platform. But other videos have been impossible to authenticate and substantiate. Some simply appear to be exploiting the interest in the invasion for views, the researchers said.                                                                                                                  , In one example, Pravda, a Ukrainian newspaper, posted an audio clip featuring 13 Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island, an outpost of the Black Sea, facing a Russian military unit that asked them to surrender. The clip was then used in many TikTok videos, some of which included a note stating that all 13 soldiers had died. Ukrainian officials later said in a Facebook post that the men were alive and had been taken prisoner, but the TikTok videos have not been corrected., “There are people who are, right now, seeing war for the first time on TikTok,” said Abbie Richards, an independent researcher who studies the app. “People trust it. The result is that a lot of people are seeing false information about Ukraine and believing it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , TikTok and other social media platforms are also under pressure from U.S. lawmakers and Ukrainian officials to curb Russian misinformation about the war, especially from state-backed media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik. In response, YouTube has said it would block Russia Today and Sputnik in the European Union, while Twitter and Meta, the parent of Facebook, have said they would label content from the outlets as state sponsored.                            , TikTok has also banned Sputnik and Russia Today in the E.U., and on Friday said it would start labeling the outlets as state-sponsored in the countries where they are still available. The app also said on Thursday that it had dedicated more resources to monitoring for misleading content about the war.                                                                                                                                                                         , “We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation,” said Hilary McQuaide, a TikTok spokeswoman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , For years, TikTok largely escaped sustained scrutiny about its content. Unlike Facebook, which has been around since 2004, and YouTube, which was founded in 2005, TikTok only became widely used in the past five years. Owned by China’s ByteDance, the app was designed to make one- to three-minute videos easy to create and share. It developed a reputation as a destination for addictive, silly and fun videos, especially for young users.                                   , The app has navigated some controversies in the past. It has faced questions over harmful fads that appeared to originate on its platform, as well as whether it allows underage users and adequately protects their privacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But the war in Ukraine has supersized the issues facing TikTok, which has over one billion users globally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The volume of war content on the app far outweighs what is found on some other social networks, according to a review by The Times. Videos with the hashtag #Ukrainewar have amassed nearly 500 million views on TikTok, with some of the most popular videos gaining close to one million likes. In contrast, the #Ukrainewar hashtag on Instagram had 125,000 posts and the most popular videos were viewed tens of thousands of times.                                              , The very features that TikTok designed to help people share and record their own content have also made it easy to spread unverified videos across its platform. That includes TikTok’s algorithm for its “For You” page, which suggests videos based on what people have previously seen, liked or shared. Viewing one video with misinformation likely leads to more videos with misinformation being shown, Ms. Richards said.                                                      , Another popular TikTok feature lets people easily reuse audio, which has enabled people to create lip-syncing scenes of popular movies or songs. But audio can be misused and taken out of context, Ms. Richards said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Over the last week, audio from a 2020 explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, was uploaded to several TikTok videos that claimed to show present-day Ukraine, according to The Times’s review. In another instance, a soundtrack of gunfire that was uploaded to TikTok on Feb. 1 — before Russia’s invasion — was later used in over 1,700 videos, many of which purported to be from the fighting in Ukraine, Ms. Richards said.                                                               , Removing such content is not easy, partly because of TikTok’s global nature. Once a video is uploaded, it is often recorded over and translated into dozens of languages. If the videos are not reported by users, they need to be independently found by content moderators proficient in those languages before they can be taken down.                                                                                                                                              , “Video is the hardest format to moderate for all platforms,” said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and a former head of security at Facebook. “When combined with the fact that TikTok’s algorithm is the primary factor for what content a user sees, as opposed to friendships or follows on the big U.S. platforms, this makes TikTok a uniquely potent platform for viral propaganda.”                                                               , Dafne Atacan, 23, a Turkish national in the San Francisco Bay Area, said she was aware that she needed to fact check TikTok videos of the war. She said she had noticed that many of the videos appeared to be edited from news reports or were commentary from people in the United States who were watching Ukraine’s events from afar.                                                                                                                                              , “I feel like lately, the videos I’m seeing are designed to get me riled up, or to emotionally manipulate me,” she said. “I get worried so now, sometimes, I find myself Googling something or checking the comments to see if it is real before I trust it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Ms. Hernandez, the student in Los Angeles, said she was surprised to learn from a Times reporter that some TikTok videos she had viewed about the war were misleading and unreliable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “I guess I don’t really know what war looks like,” she said. “But we go to TikTok to learn about everything, so it makes sense we would trust it about this too.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Ms. Hernandez added that TikTok remained her preferred platform for news. Most of what she sees on the app, she said, was real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The liberation of being pregnant on Zoom and not in the office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Credit...Margeaux Walter for The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Supported by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , By Sarah Kessler                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , For the past nine months, I have been pregnant. But I have not — for the most part — been pregnant at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In the beginning, when I felt nauseous, I threw up in my own bathroom. Saltine crackers became a constant companion but remained out of view of my Zoom camera. A couple of months later, I switched from jeans to leggings without any comment from my co-workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , And as my baby grew from the size of a lemon to a grapefruit to a cantaloupe, the box through which my colleagues see me on video calls cropped out my basketball-sized gut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Outside the virtual office, an airport security screener scolded me for trying to pick up a suitcase, cashiers became extra nice and strangers informed me of how big or small or wide or high my belly was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But when I logged on to work remotely each morning, all mentions of my ballooning body and imminent life change abruptly stopped. Instead, I focused on, talked about and was asked about work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , I didn’t intentionally hide my pregnancy from a majority of my colleagues. It just didn’t often come up. Which, I imagine, is how things often work for expectant fathers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , For parents-to-be whose bodies don’t broadcast the pregnancy, it’s possible to share news of an arriving child with close colleagues but omit it at client meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , They can inform their bosses about their intentions to take parental leave months before telling co-workers who won’t be affected by their absence; they can casually mention at the end of happy hour that their baby is due in a week or give a presentation to a large group without first disclosing that they’ve chosen to expand their family. My husband told the team he manages that he would be taking parental leave at a weekly meeting during my second trimester.                                                                                               , If you’re the one who is pregnant, at a certain point you don’t have those options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But that’s not the case with remote workers, a category that expanded to include more than 42 percent of employed Americans during the early days of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Many pregnant women cannot work remotely, and those who do tend to feel lucky. Not going into a physical office means getting to skip a lot of awkward small talk (“So, will you be breastfeeding?”) and unexpected belly rubs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , It also means a chance to avoid a certain kind of seemingly well-intentioned but unwanted help from colleagues — like preemptively lightened workloads — that can make women feel suddenly less capable. This behavior is known as “benevolent sexism” in academic literature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , There isn’t a lot of incentive to awkwardly insert a pregnancy announcement into a work conference call: Passing pregnant women over for raises and promotions, or pushing them out of their jobs entirely, is both illegal and commonplace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , And research suggests that pregnant women tend to be seen as less competent, more needing of accommodation, and less committed to work as compared with women who don’t have children, said Eden King, a professor of psychology at Rice University who studies how pregnancy affects women in the workplace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Similar stereotypes affect mothers — 63 percent of whom are working while their youngest child is under three, according to the Labor Department — but pregnancy is a more visible identity, said Ms. King. “It can be a very physical characteristic in a way that motherhood isn’t,” she said. “So some of those experiences and expectations may be exacerbated.”                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In interviews with 10 pregnant or recently pregnant remote workers for this article, several women said that being visibly pregnant in real life but not on a work Zoom screen helped them feel more confident and less apprehensive about what parenthood might mean for their career. Christine Glandorf, who works in education technology and is due with her first child this month, said that like many professionals on the brink of parenthood, she worried that people’s expectations of her in the workplace could change. Remote work solves part of that equation., “It’s nice that it’s literally not in people’s face in any way, shape or form unless I choose for it to be a part of the conversation,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Meg Rashkin, who works at a digital content agency, is due in late March with her second child. She hasn’t mentioned her pregnancy to her clients, which has allowed her to avoid awkward interactions that she experienced the first time around, like when a professional acquaintance asked if she’d been trying to get pregnant. “I can go into a client meeting and just talk about business, and I don’t have to say anything about my pregnancy to people I don’t know that well,” she said.                                                                           , In a study published in the journal Personnel Psychology in 2020, Ms. King and her colleagues asked more than 100 pregnant women in a variety of industries to track how much their supervisors, without having been asked for help, did things like assign them less work so they wouldn’t be overwhelmed or protect them from unpleasant news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Women who received more unwanted help reported feeling less capable at work, and they were more likely to want to quit nine months postpartum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “The more you experienced those seemingly positive but actually benevolently sexist behaviors, the less you believed in yourself,” Ms. King said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Laura Little, an associate professor at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia, began studying pregnancy in the workplace while she was working on her Ph.D. in organizational behavior, after noticing a change in how she was treated during her own two pregnancies. Fewer classmates and faculty included her in new projects, and some assumed she would take her career less seriously after becoming a mother, she said.                                                                                                                           , When she told one faculty member that she was pregnant with her second child, he told her she’d never get tenure. A study she conducted with colleagues, which was published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 2019, examined this apparent shift in treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Pregnant women surveyed during several time periods in the study said they received less career encouragement, such as advice about how to navigate their organization, after they disclosed their pregnancies. Expectant fathers reported receiving slightly more encouragement after they revealed that they would become parents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ms. Little said that because of persistent, if outdated, gender norms, employers might have an attitude toward expecting fathers of, “‘You’re the breadwinner, and now you’re more serious — you’re going to become more serious because you’re having a baby,’” whereas women are more likely to be viewed as less serious about their careers once they disclose that they’ll become mothers.                                                                                                                                                                               , Despite younger generations’ being more likely to say they believe women and men should be treated equally at work and at home, mothers in opposite-sex relationships still handle a majority of the housework and child care. The same pattern holds for parental leave. While almost half of men support the idea of paid paternity leave, fewer than five percent take more than two weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                , In 2004, California began a paid family leave program that provides a portion of a new parent’s salary for up to eight weeks. Though the program offers the same benefit to both new fathers and new mothers, a 2016 study found that it increased the leave women took by almost five weeks and the leave that men took by two to three days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , That was the disparity when new fathers actually had an option to take paid paternity leave. Most don’t. Paid leave is still uncommon for both men and women. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021, 23 percent of all private industry workers had access to parental leave, up from 11 percent 10 years earlier. Although the Department of Labor stopped differentiating between maternity and paternity leave in its data more than 25 years ago, other surveys suggest that paid leave is far more uncommon for fathers.                                  , These inequalities are one reason the gender pay gap, even between spouses, widens after women have children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The virtual office may be relatively new, but women have long thought about how to shape their colleagues’ perception of their pregnancies. In a 2015 study conducted by Ms. Little, researchers interviewed 35 women about their experience being pregnant at work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , About 80 percent of women brought up strategies such as hiding their bellies, working extra hard to prove they were dedicated or avoiding discussing their pregnancies. In most cases their goal was to be viewed as “the same” as before they were pregnant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , What has changed with the virtual office is that workers can downplay pregnancy more easily and for longer, and women have more control over when they inform their employers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ashlie Thomas decided not to mention that she was about 20 weeks pregnant while interviewing for a remote customer assistance job at a software company. “If they decided not to hire me, I didn’t want it to be based on my pregnancy,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After she got the job, Ms. Thomas waited until she was about seven months pregnant to tell her employer she would be taking leave and planned to tell her team a week before her delivery date. The late announcement, she said, would allow her to feel that, “I’ve demonstrated that I can do this job, and I’m capable, and now I’m comfortable sharing this with you.” But she never made it to the meeting where she planned to share her news. That morning, she gave birth to her son.                                                                                 , Not all women who have kept their pregnancies out of their video conference calls say they are afraid of discrimination. Some of the women I spoke with for this article felt that the news was too private to share widely or that they didn’t want to exacerbate their own anxiety about potentially losing the pregnancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Others thought bringing up their pregnancy would be a distraction to their work or were just happy to wear comfortable clothes and carry around a bottle of Tums without their co-workers watching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Some women had also decided to reveal their pregnancy to their co-workers early on despite working remotely. Jacqueline Kim Perez, who works for a blockchain company, announced her pregnancy at a company meeting during the first trimester because she expected her colleagues to be supportive. (They were.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Another woman who works as a recruiter — and asked not to be named because she hadn’t told most of her colleagues she is pregnant — disclosed the news to her boss earlier than she would have liked because she needed accommodations for a high-risk pregnancy. Despite reassurances, she was fearful of how he would react. Recruiting is a metrics-driven industry, she said, and her numbers are suffering because of fatigue and time away for doctors appointments, which she believes could negatively impact her career no matter what her boss says.                , Giving a growing bump less visibility can’t compensate for an unsupportive organization, especially when pregnancy conflicts with a job, like when doctor appointments cut into billable hours or fatigue, nausea and other common pregnancy symptoms interfere with work responsibilities. And delaying a companywide announcement doesn’t mean women will face less bias once they become mothers.                                                                                                                                                                          , Still, most of the women I interviewed agreed there was something nice about having the option to act more like expectant fathers when discussing their pregnancies at work. When I finally started to roll out my news to some colleagues during my third trimester, I enjoyed occasionally acknowledging my major life change during the work day, especially when it was literally kicking me in the ribs. At the same time, I was happy to have a choice when it came to how and when to bring it up.                                                                     , As companies summon people back to the office, fewer people will have that choice. But there is part of the remote work pregnancy experience that can be replicated offline, Ms. King said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “Some women do need help, and some women do want accommodations,” she said. But “you have to ask women what they want and what they need and not assume that we know.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Advertisement </td>

Here’s what you can do to ease your mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , By Ron Lieber                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , What if the lights go out? Or A.T.M. networks go down? Or digital giants like Google that I trust with vital information come under attack?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , These are normal questions to have right now, as Russian tanks move through Ukraine and upend our expectations of global stability. After all, Russia and those who might act on its behalf have already shown the ability to strike our digital infrastructure, and we don’t know what President Vladimir V. Putin might be willing to do if escalating sanctions make him feel cornered.                                                                                                                           , But first, let’s be clear about one thing: There’s no sign of immediate danger to you. That’s not true for people who live in Ukraine or have had to flee, so consider helping them first if you can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , National security officials say there have been no specific, credible cyberthreats against the United States homeland. The United States also maintains its own extensive cybercapabilities, including forays into the Russian electrical grid, that could make Mr. Putin wary of setting off a kind of mutually assured disruption.                                                                                                                                                                                 , However, the federal Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency has urged organizations and individuals to be prepared for the possibility that the situation could change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , It has name-checked industries and organizations at particular risk, including coronavirus researchers and the health, pharmaceutical, defense, energy, video-game and aviation industries. Some of those are not surprising: Federal officials suspect that Russian nationals were behind ransomware efforts like the ones that led to fuel shortages in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline shutdown last year and technology meltdowns at hospitals in 2020.                                                        , The good news — if there can be any at a global moment like this one — is that many of the precautions you should be taking now are the same ones you’d take in preparation for a natural disaster or any power outage. Others are the kinds of things you should be doing no matter what.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Digital brinkmanship involving global powers may leave you feeling that there’s only so much you can do to help. But good digital hygiene really is its own form of civil defense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The hacking of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign began with something we can all understand: a phishing email requesting a password change. If you work in any kind of sensitive job, you could be vulnerable too, even on personal email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “They want your passwords,” said Karen Walsh, who runs a marketing company that helps cybersecurity companies explain their capabilities in plain English, “because people reuse passwords between home and work.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Eric Gosh, an Air Force veteran who spent part of his time shielding sensitive technology from Russia, now runs a Chicago technology consulting firm. He constantly reminds clients to ask themselves three questions when strange emails arrive, and the answer is supposed to be yes to all of them: Is it from someone I know? Is it what I was expecting? Is it in the format I was expecting?                                                                                                                   , “If the answer is no, pick up the phone and call,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ms. Walsh recommends a tried-and-true 3-2-1 plan for backups: Three copies of any essential data in two different formats or types of storage media, with one of them in a cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , If you’re undergoing sensitive medical treatment right now, for instance, it’s wise to maintain multiple copies of your records, keeping in mind the mess that malware made of hospital systems in 2020. Your health care provider might have them, sure — but you can ask for and keep your own copy in the cloud as well as on a thumb drive or in a paper folder.                                                                                                                                                 , There’s more. Update the operating systems on your devices, or better yet, enable automatic updates.

There is what he called “massive” replication and distribution in its systems, so wiping the cloud clean of everything, everywhere, would be a tall order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , And there’s a decent chance that wouldn’t be the goal, anyway. “Attacks that come from nation states and certain criminal groups often go after targets with things that they want — defense or media or dissidents,” he said. “They come at those accounts rather than the overall infrastructure.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The power and communications infrastructure that allows technology to function isn’t something that mere individuals can defend. Here, any preparations for a lights-out aftermath are hopefully those that you’ve already made in case weather or any unforeseen disruption upends your life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , That means flashlights for every person in the house, fresh batteries every so often, candles and matches, solar-powered sources for small devices, portable power stations and backup generators if you can afford and find one. Not letting your car’s gas tank sit at half-empty or below is always a good idea, too.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Setting aside a small pile of emergency cash makes sense only if you will remember where you put it. More likely than not, you won’t need it — and if you don’t have an obvious place to stash it, like a safe, it could easily slip your mind. Share the location with someone you trust, and set a quarterly calendar reminder so you don’t forget that it’s in a little-used shoe that could end up at Goodwill when you make a donation run two years from now.                                                  , Besides, David N. Tente, an executive at the industry association for people who concern themselves with A.T.M.s, reminded me this week that there is no single A.T.M. network, since some have independent operators while banks control others. “If someone was able to disable your favorite A.T.M., you could almost certainly find another A.T.M. to use for your withdrawal,” he wrote.                                                                                                                        , Other precautions are of the basic variety that make sense in the face of a big snowstorm. A few jugs of water are never a bad idea. And Mr. Gosh, the Air Force veteran and technology consultant, said that most people already have enough nonperishable food around that they could feed a family in a pinch for at least a couple of days, a reasonable amount of time for the proper authorities to sort out digital disruptions. He keeps his freezer stocked with chicken broth for pho, the Vietnamese soup., My conversation with him this week was marked by a kind of serenity. He wasn’t about to ransack Costco or pile his shelves with items from prepper.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “Stay calm,” he said. “It’s easier to be calm if you’ve done a little bit of preparation.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UAE is placed on money laundering watchdog's 'gray list' </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , An intergovernmental organization dedicated to combating money laundering and illicit cash flows on Friday placed the United Arab Emirates on its "gray list" over concerns that the Gulf country isn't sufficiently stemming illegal financial activities.                                          , The UAE was one of several countries listed by The Financial Action Task Force as being under increased monitoring due to "strategic deficiencies" in their efforts to counter money-laundering.                                                                                                     , "Jurisdictions under increased monitoring are actively working with the FATF to address strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing," the organization said.                                                               , "When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies," it continued.                                                                                                                         , The state-run Emirates News Agency, in a statement published late Friday, said the FATF "has recognised that the United Arab Emirates has made positive progress in its anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), and counter proliferation financing (CPF) efforts.", The watchdog group's "gray list" is not as severe as its "black list," which includes North Korea and Iran.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Other countries on the gray list include Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan and Yemen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The UAE is the financial hub of the Middle East, home to numerous international companies' headquarters, one of the world's busiest airports, and a roughly 90% expat population.                                                                                                                    , "The UAE takes its role in protecting the integrity of the global financial system extremely seriously and will work closely with the FATF to quickly remedy the areas of improvement identified," said the UAE's agency in charge of combating money laundering, according to Emirates News Agency. , Got a confidential news tip?

The new approach comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to get the quick victory he wanted, and the Russian military has faced a stiff and determined Ukrainian resistance across the country.                                                          , In the face of the resistance, the attacks will increase, officials warned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The days to come are likely to be worse, with more death, more suffering, and more destruction, as the Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday.                                                                                                                                                              , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the sentiment during a news conference in Brussels Friday where he is meeting with European allies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "The Kremlin's attacks are inflicting an ever-increasing toll on civilians there," Blinken said. "Hundreds if not thousands of Ukrainians have been killed, many more wounded, as have citizens of other countries. More than a million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> China sets GDP target of 'around 5.5%' for 2022 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , BEIJING — China announced a gross domestic product growth target of "around 5.5%" for 2022, as an annual parliamentary meeting gets underway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Premier Li Keqiang revealed the figure in a speech on Saturday morning local time. It is not unusual for the official GDP target to be approximate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Other economic targets Li announced, for employment and inflation, were the same as last year's.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , However, he said the deficit-to-GDP ratio would be 2.8% this year, lower than last year's 3.2%. He expects fiscal revenue to grow in 2022, and that the government can use profits from state-owned enterprises, allowing a spending increase of more than 2 trillion yuan ($316.5 billion) in 2022 over 2021.                                                                                 , Total central government expenditures for the general public budget are expected to rise by 14.3% to 13.40 trillion yuan this year, China's Ministry of Finance said in a separate report released Saturday about the national budget for the year. That includes a plan for a 7.1% increase in defense spending.                                                                              , China will target an unemployment rate in cities of "no more than 5.5%" and a consumer price index of "around 3%," according to Li. He added the country plans to add "over 11 million new urban jobs" — also the same figure as last year.                                                                                                                                                    , "A comprehensive analysis of evolving dynamics at home and abroad indicates that this year our country will encounter many more risks and challenges, and we must keep pushing to overcome them," he said, according to an official English-language version of his remarks. "The harder things get, the more confident we must be, and the more solid steps we must take to deliver outcomes.", Li's closing remarks included a statement on how China would "set the stage" for the Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress. That meeting, expected in the fall, is set to give President Xi Jinping an unprecedented third term.                                                                                                                                                    , Economists widely expected the GDP target to be set at about 5% or slightly higher. They want details about stimulus plans for an economy that has slowed significantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , A target of "around 5.5%" GDP growth comes on the high end of those expectations. In a separate report Saturday, the national economic planning agency said "achieving this goal will require arduous efforts."                                                                                                                                                                                , Li said Saturday that to reach this year's economic targets, China needs to pursue "prudent and effective macro policies," with "flexible and appropriate" monetary policy.

Under the legislation, which could take effect as early as Saturday, journalists who simply describe the war as a “war” could be sentenced to prison., “The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country,” Bloomberg’s editor in chief, John Micklethwait, wrote in a note to staff.                                                                                                     , CNN International, the global arm of CNN, said it had stopped airing in Russia, and ABC News said that it would not broadcast from the country on Friday. “We will continue to assess the situation and determine what this means for the safety of our teams on the ground,” ABC News, which is based in New York, said in a statement.                                                             , News organizations are not necessarily asking their correspondents to leave Russia, at least not yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “We are not pulling out BBC News journalists from Moscow,” Jonathan Munro, the interim director of BBC News, wrote on Twitter. “We cannot use their reporting for the time being but they remain valued members of our teams and we hope to get them back on our output as soon as possible.”                                                                                                        , He added: “Thoughts with colleagues in Moscow whose voices cannot be silenced for long.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , A spokeswoman for The New York Times had no immediate comment on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The censorship law builds on the Kremlin’s insistence that characterizations of its attacks on Ukraine as a “war” or “invasion” rather than a “special military operation” amount to disinformation. Its passage prompted several independent Russian media outlets to shut down their operations, as well.                                                                                          , Several foreign news outlets said their journalists in Ukraine would continue to report on the Russian invasion. This week, the BBC said it would use shortwave radio frequencies to broadcast news in Kyiv and in parts of Russia.                                                                                                                                                                  , Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, accused the BBC of playing “a determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security.” Early on Friday, the BBC reported that access to its website in Russia appeared to be restricted.                                                                                                                                  , Mr. Putin has been dismantling the last vestiges of a Russian free press. On Thursday, the pillars of Russia’s independent broadcast media collapsed under pressure from the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Echo of Moscow, the freewheeling radio station that was founded by Soviet dissidents in 1990 and symbolized Russia’s new freedoms, was “liquidated” by its board. TV Rain, the youthful independent television station that calls itself “the optimistic channel,” said it would suspend operations indefinitely.                                                                                    , And Dmitri A. Muratov, the journalist who shared the Nobel Peace Prize last year, said that his newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which survived the murders of six of its journalists, could be on the verge of shutting down as well.                                                                                                                                                                       , Advertisement </td>

Gov. Jay Inslee has not said whether he intends to sign the legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mike Faulk, a spokesman for Mr. Inslee, said Friday that the governor’s office usually did not “speculate on bill action,” adding, “Once legislators send it to our office, we’ll evaluate it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The Senate legislation — the result of a compromise between the companies and at least one prominent local union, the Teamsters — was approved 40 to 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , In a statement, John Scearcy, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 117, said the union was “proud to stand in solidarity with Uber and Lyft drivers in winning their demands for pay raises” and other benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Uber and Lyft have noted in regulatory filings that being required to classify drivers as employees would force changes to their business model and could leave them exposed financially. They have sought similar compromises in states including California and New York, but those efforts collapsed amid resistance from other unions and worker advocates, who argued that gig drivers should not have to settle for second-class status. Many of those advocates criticized the Washington bill as well.           , “While the bill provides some benefits to drivers, it would permanently lock the door on drivers accessing their rights as employees,” said Brian Chen of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group. “That is a misstep with serious ramifications, which is concerning given how fast this bill is moving through the legislature.”                                                                                                                                                                        , Under the compromise, drivers would receive benefits like paid sick leave and a minimum pay rate. The bill would also create a process for drivers to appeal so-called deactivations, which prevent them from finding work through the companies’ apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , While the minimum pay rates apply only to the time that drivers spend with a passenger in the car, supporters of the bill say the rates have been set high enough to compensate drivers fairly for all of their work time after expenses. The rates will be adjusted over time to account for cost of living increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , As with other contractors, drivers must cover all payroll taxes and cannot unionize under federal law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The bill is largely silent on unemployment benefits, something that employees are entitled to, but Washington State has frequently found that gig drivers should receive those benefits already. The bill will create a task force to study what the gig companies’ contributions to an unemployment insurance trust fund should be, an issue that has been contentious in other states.                                                                                                                                 , One especially controversial feature of the bill is that it would block local jurisdictions from regulating drivers’ rights. A similar feature helped ignite opposition that killed the prospects for such a bill in New York State last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Seattle enacted a robust minimum wage law for gig drivers in 2020, which was intended to provide drivers with hourly pay of roughly $30 before expenses and was sharply criticized by gig companies. The statewide bill approved Friday preserved the current rates in Seattle, which will continue to be higher than the rest of the state,  but would pre-empt similar legislation in the future.                                                                                                                      , Looming in the background of the legislative action in Washington State was the possibility of a ballot measure that could have locked in contractor status with weaker benefits for drivers. After California passed a law in 2019 that effectively classified gig workers as employees, Uber, Lyft and other gig companies spent roughly $200 million on a ballot measure, Proposition 22, that rolled back those protections. The legislation is still being litigated after a state judge deemed it unconstitutional., Representative Liz Berry, who introduced the Washington State bill, said the differences between it and Proposition 22 “couldn’t be more stark.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “My focus has been: What do the workers want? What are the drivers asking for? And we deliver on every single thing they asked for,” Ms. Berry said in an interview, adding that in contrast to California’s law, “our bill has real benefits that employees in the state of Washington enjoy.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Jen Hensley, Lyft’s head of government relations, said in a statement that the bill was “a solution that Washington State’s drivers overwhelmingly support. Not only does it deliver meaningful new benefits, it also expands important protections for them.” An Uber statement echoed those comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But some Washington legislators had doubts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Ahead of the vote on Friday, Senator Mike Padden, who opposed the bill, worried about the speed of the approval process. “I do have some concerns about the bill itself, but I also have some concerns about not really being able to check it out properly,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Representative Debra Entenman, the only Democrat to vote against the bill in Washington’s House of Representatives, said in a statement after its Senate passage that “this bill requires too much from the state, delivers too little for drivers, and increases transportation costs for my constituents who often rely on rideshare companies because of inadequate public transportation options.”                                                                                                                   , Worker advocates worried that other states would try to replicate the legislation. “I hope Governor Inslee seeks additional analysis of its potential impact,” said Terri Gerstein, a workers rights lawyer at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program. “I would urge other states not to use this bill or cursory public process as a model.”                                                                                                                                                                   , Advertisement </td>

It may be a small fraction of Russia's growing penalties for what it has unleashed on the Ukraine, but they target a constituency that is better positioned to express discontent," she said., She described brands making supportive comments on social media while supplying luxury goods as "hypocritical".                                                                                                                                , Prof. Thomai Serdari from the Stern School of Business at NYU said that luxury brands were mainly "in the business of selling their creations", goods that many people "covet".                                                                , "In tense moments like the one we are living now, it is a very good idea to not aggravate the situation with an explicit statement that would offend anyone and that could perhaps provoke a worse reaction," she suggested.                   , She added that there was "no question", however, that Russia's isolation would hurt high-end brands who have a presence in the country or continue to sell their goods online there.                                                           , Sir Ian McKellen opens up in a probing interview with Amol Rajan                                                                                                                                                                               , Panorama reports on the conflict in Ukraine                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Can the Fraud Squad catch those responsible?                                                                                                                                                                                                   , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Severe sanctions on Russia aim to isolate the country and create a deep recession there, but the economic fallout will also be felt by people around the world.                                                                                                                             , The sharp rise in the prices of things from oil and metals to wheat is expected to push up the cost of many everyday items from food to petrol and heating.                                                                                                                                 , People in the UK and Europe are already paying high prices for energy and fuel.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to drive these even higher and has already caused the oil price to jump to its highest level in more than seven years, while future gas prices doubled in just one day earlier this week.                                                           , If gas prices stay at that level, energy analysts have warned that household fuel bills in the UK could reach as high as £3,000 a year, while average petrol prices have already hit a record high of nearly 153p, with diesel at 157p.                                                     , Russia is the second-biggest exporter of crude oil, and the world's largest natural gas exporter, which is vital to heating homes, powering planes and filling cars with fuel.                                                                                                              , The UK gets only 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but the EU sources nearly half of its gas from the country.                                                                                                                                                             , If one country reliant on Russian supplies receives less gas, they have to replace it, impacting the supplies of gas for other countries - that's why British energy prices and bills are still affected in a similar way to European ones.                                                 , There are now fears President Vladimir Putin might "weaponise" Russia's natural resources by reducing supplies of gas to Europe in response to sanctions. Politicians in Germany are calling for a "national gas reserve" to be created to protect consumers from price shocks.             , Plane fuel is also linked to the price of crude oil and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has warned tickets for this summer will be higher than 2019, partly because of the rise in the price of oil.                                                                                           , UK food producers don't import many items from Russia or Ukraine, but prices here may still rise because of an increase in associated costs, such as tinned cans and packaging and transport.                                                                                               , Meanwhile, the cost of everyday food items might rise in places like Turkey and North Africa, which rely on wheat and corn from Ukraine and Russia.                                                                                                                                         , Both countries, once dubbed "the breadbasket of Europe", export about a quarter of the world's wheat and half of its sunflower products, like seeds and oil. Ukraine also sells a lot of corn globally.                                                                                     , Analysts have warned that war could impact the production of grains and even double global wheat prices.                                                                                                                                                                                    , More than 40% of Ukraine's wheat and corn exports went to the Middle East or Africa last year - and disruptions to supply could affect availability in these areas.                                                                                                                         , The UK, by contrast, typically produces more than 90% of the wheat consumed in the country. But farmers here might find themselves paying more for fertiliser, which is one of Russia's biggest exports.                                                                                    , Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living rises over time, hit 7.5% in January in the US - the highest level seen there since February 1982 - and rose by 5.5% in the UK.                                                                                                       , But one economist has warned it could rise close to 10% in major Western economies if the cost of energy and food is pushed up by dwindling supplies cause by the Russian-Ukraine conflict.                                                                                                 , Such a figure might encourage the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend. As a result, they will buy fewer things, and prices will stop rising as fast.             , But in the UK, for example, about 2.2 million homeowners with mortgages linked to the Bank of England's base rate would see repayments go up, putting further pressure on household budgets that are already being squeezed by the cost of living.                                          , Russian stocks crashed by as much as 45% in the wake of the Ukraine invasion with trading subsequently suspended, with banks and oil companies among the worst affected.                                                                                                                    , It also led to steep falls on stock markets elsewhere around the world: in Europe the UK's FTSE 100 index has fallen over 6% since Russia crossed into Ukraine while Germany's Dax index is nearly 10% lower.                                                                               , Many people's reaction to stock market changes is that they are not directly affected, because they don't invest money in stocks and shares. But there are millions of people with a pension whose savings are invested in the stock market.                                                , If widespread falls in share prices are sustained then it's likely to be bad news for pension savers because the value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of investments.                                                                                                , Some investors or savers might look to protect their money or assets by moving them to traditional "safe havens", like gold, especially as the markets are likely to see more volatility as the crisis develops.                                                                            , But pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet and advisers say it's important not to panic about short-term movements up or down.                                                                                                                                  , As a leading commodities exporter, Russia is one of the world's largest suppliers of metals used in everything from aluminium cans, to copper wires, to car components, such as nickel, which is used in lithium-iron batteries, and palladium, which is used in catalytic converters.      , Everyday goods - which may seem far removed from the conflict - may rise as a result of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "When you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure," the boss of the London Metals Exchange has warned.                                      , If Vladimir Putin decided to cut off supplies of these metals in retaliation to sanctions, existing supply problems could worsen, with car firms having to find alternative sources.                                                                                                        , Russia is also home to manufacturing hubs for brands like Stellantis, Volkswagen and Toyota.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Average national gasoline price surges to $3.83 a gallon, the highest since 2012 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Gas prices are surging, with the national average now at the highest in nearly a decade. The rapid ascent is pinching consumers' pockets, and experts say there may be little end in sight.                                                                                                                                                     , The national average for a gallon of regular gas stood at $3.83 on Friday,  the highest since Sept. 21, 2012, according to data from AAA. Prices are rising at a fast clip, with Friday's average nearly 11 cents a gallon above Thursday's. Americans are paying about 27 cents more than last week, and 41 cents more than a month ago.       , In some places consumers are paying a lot more. In California, the state average is now $5.07 per gallon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The surge in prices has become a headache for President Joe Biden whose administration has vowed for months that it's working to combat high prices at the pump.                                                                                                                                                                                , Rising oil prices are behind the spike. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, topped $116 per barrel Thursday, the highest level since 2008. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions levied against the nation's financial sector are prompting fears of supply shortages in what was already a tight market., More than 50% of the cost of gasoline is based on the price of oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, fell over 1% to close around 113,940 on Friday, in line with its global counterparts, amid concerns over escalating tensions in Ukraine. Risk aversion increased after Russian troops last night occupied the area of Ukraine's Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. On the domestic economic front, Brazil's economy advanced 0.5% on quarter in the last three months of 2021, above market estimates of a 0.1% rise and officially exiting a mild recession. For full 2021, the Brazilian economy advanced 4.6%, the most since 2010, recovering from a 3.9% pandemic-induced slump in 2020. Meanwhile, Brazil's Bovespa added almost 1% higher. </td>

I think it's having an immense impact on Russia and on Russians -- both the sanctions, also the weakness in devaluation of the ruble -- these hit people hard."         , Cavuto asked if the global financial community will continue to take actions against Russia after the war in Ukraine ends. The World Bank president said there’s a "global outpouring in favor of Ukraine" that will have "lasting consequences, whatever the outcome of the war." , He added an important factor is how China will react to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                              , "I think as you look at the situation, China itself has to be horrified at where this is developing. That will be an important issue in how world trade develops," Malpass concluded.                                                                                              , "[China] buy[s] oil from Russia when the sanctions are in place, but…can their companies really remain part of the world system when they're so engaged with Russia?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> U.S. oil futures jump more than 7% to highest finish in more than a decade - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Oil futures climbed on Friday, with U.S. prices ending at their highest in more than 13 years, as Russian's invasion of Ukraine, and Western nations' sanctions on Moscow in retaliation, threaten to disrupt global crude supplies. Oil prices have been "a one-way market, but the potential return of Iranian crude supplies could provide much relief to this very tight market," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. News reports said Iran and world powers were close to an agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal, which is expected to lead the U.S. to lift sanctions on Tehran, allowing more oil to flow into the global market.

        +4.02%
       powered up 2.4% in afternoon trading Friday toward a 3 1/2-year high, as the oil and gas exploration and production company benefited from the spike up in oil prices to a 14-year high, and as the company's credit rating was put in position to be lifted out of "junk" territory. Continuous crude oil futures shot up 7.3% to $115.51, the highest price seen since September 2008 as Russia's war on Ukraine intensified. Separately, Moody's Investors Service raised Marathon Oil's Corporate Family Rating to Ba1, which is one notch below investment grade, from Ba2. The outlook for the rating remains "positive," which makes the next rating move most likely to be another upgrade if the company remains focused on debt reduction. "Occidental Petroleum generated increasingly higher earnings in 2021 as oil and gas prices rose, and significantly reduced its leverage by applying free cash flow and asset sale proceeds towards debt reduction," said Moody's analyst James Wilkins.

The Bank of Moscow closed trading on the Moscow exchange for the entire week.                                                                                                                           , In some cases, the receipts of Russian stocks that are traded elsewhere, such as London or the U.S. - which are owned by many of the ETFs — have also been halted.                                                                                                                                                   , Jan van Eck, the CEO of VanEck, told CNBC's Bob Pisani this week that it is not uncommon for ETFs to trade even if the underlying market is closed.                                                                                                                                                                  , "ETFs trade all the time when the underlying is not traded. Obviously all Asia ETFs trade when the Asia markets at closed. Russia, on a normal day, closes at 9 a.m. so RSX is almost always trading based on 'stale prices,'" van Eck said.                                                                         , However, the long closure and the dramatic moves have created uncertainty about what, if anything, the Russian stocks will be worth.                                                                                                                                                                                 , Another issue for these funds, and for others that track international stocks more broadly, is that market index providers have taken moves to carve out the Russian stocks.                                                                                                                                         , FTSE Russell and S&amp;P Global announced this week that they would remove Russian stocks from their indexes. MSCI similarly said it was reclassifying the market as a standalone market instead of an emerging one, effectively eliminating the Russian stocks from its major indexes.                                  , The dramatic declines and lack of liquidity could make it difficult for fund managers to follow their indexes, said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar.                                                                                                                                     , "The question becomes, okay, if I'm not required to own them, how exactly do I get rid of them when I have no viable means of liquidating those positions," Johnson said.                                                                                                                                            , Some funds may choose to simply set the stocks to the side and mark them to zero instead of trying to unload them, Johnson said.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The lack of liquidity is also an issue for larger investors who might want to redeem their shares of an ETF — often described as "outflows" from a fund — rather than simply selling their shares on the open market.                                                                                                , "The creation-redemption mechanism in these pure-play Russia ETFs for all intents and purposes right now is fundamentally impaired. It's just not going to work," Johnson said.                                                                                                                                      , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures surged almost 8% to above $115-per-barrel on Friday, not far from a 14-year high of $116.57 hit in the prior session, and posting their biggest weekly gain since May of 2020 as US lawmakers push to cut off US imports of oil and petroleum products from Russia. Despite widening sanctions on Moscow, OPEC+ will stick to an existing pact for a gradual increase in production. OPEC+ agreed to boost output by 400,000 bpd for March, leaving it with another 2.6 million bpd of cuts to unwind by the end of September. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures rose to $5 per million British thermal units on Friday, closing on the strongest level since November supported by strong overseas demand and following a rise in prices of other energy commodities. Natural gas prices in Europe and Asia hit record highs this week as concerns over Russian supplies intensified after a war in Ukraine entered a more aggressive stage boosting competition for LNG shipments from US. While Europe is the biggest importer of US LNG cargoes traders in Asia were forced to ramp up prices in order to attract more shipments. Domestically, natural gas stocks shrank slightly more than expected last week, and sit below the 5-year average. For the week, the contract is set for a 10% rise. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Index giant S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said Friday it is removing all stocks listed and/or domiciled in Russia from its benchmarks in light of the country's invasion of Ukraine, further isolating the nation from the global economy.                        , The removal, effective before the open next Wednesday, also affects Russian American depositary receipts (ADRs), S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said.                                                                                                              , The firm, which is the keeper of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500, also said it will declassify Russia as an emerging market and categorize it as a standalone group.                                                                     , The move came as Russian forces attacked Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine early Friday morning, causing a fire to break out at an adjacent training facility. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv called the attack a war crime.                      , Earlier Friday, the NYSE halted trading in three Russian ETFs — Franklin FTSE Russia ETF (FLRU), iShares MSCI Russia ETF (ERUS) and Direxion Daily Russia Bull 2X Shares (RUSL). The exchange cited "regulatory concerns" for these halts.                , Exchange-traded funds tracking Russian stocks have been in a tailspin since the geopolitical tensions escalated. The iShares MSCI Russia ETF tumbled 33.4% for its worst day Tuesday since the fund's inception in 2010, and after losing 27.9% on Monday., Meanwhile, shares of the VanEck Russia ETF ended February down 54.9%, closing out its worst month ever.                                                                                                                                                   , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The big raises that many Americans got over the past year are starting to get smaller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Workers in the private sector saw average wages grow by 5.1% in the past year, to $31.58 an hour, according to the February jobs report issued Friday by the U.S. Department of Labor. Rank-and-file workers saw a higher bump, of 6.7%, to $26.94 an hour in February.                                                                                                                                      , Employers have paid bigger paychecks to compete for workers in a competitive hiring market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , While February's annual wage growth is high by historical standards, there are signs that it's tempering. Hourly earnings for all workers rose by just 1 cent (or, by 0.03%) last month relative to January, a weak gain relative to prior months.                                                                                                                                                           , "What we're seeing is the sign that, in aggregate, wage growth is slowing down a little bit," said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , For context, workers had gotten roughly 3.5% annual raises prepandemic, which at the time was considered robust, Bunker said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "Even if wages don't continue to accelerate, but they're 4% or 5%, that's still quite strong," he said. But it wouldn't be the same "gangbusters" growth from early 2021, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Workers enjoyed greater bargaining power as the U.S. economy started emerging from its pandemic hibernation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Employers' demand for workers rose at the same time that Covid-related factors (like health fears, child care duties, early retirements and a bigger cash buffer) were limiting their supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Job openings surged to record levels. Businesses raised pay to attract scarce talent. Workers started quitting their jobs at record levels, many enticed by higher pay elsewhere, part of a trend dubbed the "Great Resignation."                                                                                                                                                                            , More from Personal Finance:When buy now, pay later comes back to bite youHow to tackle medical debt before it's a long-lasting problemHow the Ukraine-Russia conflict may push up prices for Americans                                                                                                                                                                                                       , However, workers are reentering the labor force, increasing their availability and making it easier for employers to hire. Wages, in turn, may come down, and workers may lose some of their bargaining power.                                                                                                                                                                                               , The labor force grew by 304,000 people in February, according to the Labor Department. (It remains 592,000 people shy of its February 2020 level.) The U.S. economy added 678,000 new jobs in February, the most since July and a continuation of recent strong growth.                                                                                                                                      , Better pay is attracting workers off the sidelines, Bunker said. Jobs, especially in-person ones, may also be more palatable as risks posed by the Covid omicron virus variant recede.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Despite higher pay, average wages haven't kept pace with inflation. Consumer prices rose by 7.5% in January relative to a year earlier, a 40-year high. Annual inflation outstripped February's 5.1% average pay increase.                                                                                                                                                                                   , When a household's wages rise at a slower pace than inflation, it means they have less purchasing power. Their paychecks don't go as far at the grocery store and at the gas pump, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "Will inflation similarly slow down, and will it slow at the same pace or more?" Bunker asked of consumer prices relative to average wage growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates this month to cool down the economy and reduce inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Workers' raises have been much stronger than average in certain sectors of the economy, especially lower-paying, in-person jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In some cases, they've far surpassed the rate of inflation. For example, rank-and-file workers in leisure and hospitality jobs (such as bars, restaurants and hotels) have seen pay increase over 14% in the past year, to $17.22 an hour. (That equates to about $36,000 a year before tax.)                                                                                                                , Their pay growth is slowing down, too, when looking over shorter periods of time. Low-wage workers saw earnings increase by an average 7.6% in the three months through January, relative to 11.4% in the three months through August 2021, according to an Indeed analysis of federal data. (Low-wage industries include department stores, food services and drinking places, and child day care services.), Lower-income households have also felt inflation more acutely than higher-income ones, because more of their household budgets are earmarked for energy and transportation, which are among the categories that have seen prices rise fastest.                                                                                                                                                               , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Ibex 35 Index sunk 3.6% to close at 7,721 on Friday, the lowest close since November of 2020 as investors rushed to safer assets after Russia’s assault on Ukraine intensified when facilities in Europe’s largest nuclear reactor in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, caught fire amid heavy shelling by Russian forces, raising concerns of an environmental disaster. The tourism sector was amid the biggest losers in Madrid, driven by Amadeus (-8.6%), Melia Hotels (-8%), and IAG (-5.8%). The financial sector also took a big hit, in line with its European counterparts, led by Banco Sabadell (-9%) in Madrid. The Ibex 35 closed the week down over 9%. </td>

They knocked Russian and Ukrainian government websites offline, graffitied antiwar messages onto the home pages of Russian media outlets and leaked data from rival hacking operations. And they swarmed into chat rooms, awaiting new instructions and egging each other on.                                                                                                                            , The war in Ukraine has provoked an onslaught of cyberattacks by apparent volunteers unlike any that security researchers have seen in previous conflicts, creating widespread disruption, confusion and chaos that researchers fear could provoke more serious attacks by nation-state hackers, escalate the war on the ground or harm civilians.                                                                                                , “It is crazy, it is bonkers, it is unprecedented,” said Matt Olney, the director of threat intelligence at the security firm Cisco Talos. “This is not going to be solely a conflict among nations. There are going to be participants that are not under the strict control of any government.”                                                                                                                                                 , The online battles have blurred the lines between state-backed hackers and patriotic amateurs, making it difficult for governments to understand who is attacking them and how to retaliate. But both Ukraine and Russia appear to have embraced tech-savvy volunteers, creating channels on the chat app Telegram to direct them to target specific websites.                                                                                   , Hackers have inserted themselves in international conflicts before in places like Syria. But experts said that those efforts have attracted fewer participants. The hundreds of hackers now racing to support their respective governments represent a drastic and unpredictable expansion of cyberwarfare.                                                                                                                                      , The involvement of the volunteer hackers makes it more difficult to determine who is responsible for an online attack. Some of the hackers said they were Ukrainians living inside and outside the country. Some said they were citizens of other countries who were simply interested in the conflict. It was impossible in some circumstances to verify their identities.                                                                      , Their attacks stand apart from the sophisticated incursions made by nation-state hackers in recent years. While hackers affiliated with the Russian government have quietly infiltrated American government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, these participants have loudly proclaimed their allegiances and used simpler methods to topple or deface websites.                                                                               , And while their tactics appear to have been successful in some instances, security researchers cautioned it was unrealistic to believe cyberattacks by volunteer hackers without specialized technical expertise would play a determinative role in the military campaign on the ground.                                                                                                                                                         , “The land invasion is advancing, people are suffering, buildings are being destroyed,” said Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and a former cyberwarfare adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. “Cyberattacks can’t realistically impact this.”                                                                                                                                                , Ukraine has been more deliberate about recruiting a volunteer hacking force. In Telegram channels, participants cheer their collaboration with the government in going after targets such as Sberbank, the Russian state-owned bank. From Russia, where links between the government and hacking groups have long raised alarms among Western officials, there has not been the same kind of overt calls to action.                              , “We are creating an I.T. army,” Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted on Saturday, directing cybersecurity enthusiasts to a Telegram channel that contained instructions for knocking Russian websites offline. “There will be tasks for everyone.” By Friday, the Telegram channel had more than 285,000 subscribers.                                                                                         , Inside the main English-language Telegram page for the I.T. Army of Ukraine is a 14-page introductory document providing details about how people can participate, including what software to download to mask their whereabouts and identity. Every day, new targets are listed, including websites, telecommunications firms, banks and A.T.M. processors.                                                                                     , Yegor Aushev, the co-founder of the Ukrainian cybersecurity company Cyber Unit Technologies, said he was flooded with notes after posting on social media a call for programmers to get involved. His company offered a $100,000 reward for those who identify flaws in the code of Russian cyber targets.                                                                                                                                       , Mr. Aushev said there were more than 1,000 people involved in his effort, working in close collaboration with the government. People were only allowed to join if somebody vouched for them. Organized into small groups, they were aiming to hit high-impact targets like infrastructure and logistics systems important to the Russian military.                                                                                               , “It’s become an independent machine, a distributed international digital army,” Mr. Aushev said. “The biggest hacks against Russia will be soon,” he added, without elaborating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A government spokesman confirmed the work with Mr. Aushev.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Figuring out who is behind a cyberattack is always difficult. Groups falsely take credit or boast of a bigger impact than actually occurred. But this week there was a string of attacks against Russian targets. The country’s largest stock exchange, a state-controlled bank and the Russian Foreign Ministry were taken offline for a time after being targeted by Ukraine’s volunteer hackers.                                              , On Monday, TripAdvisor and Google Maps halted reviews at some locations in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus after pro-Ukraine volunteers targeted the sites to share uncensored information with the Russian public about the war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , On Wednesday, the website of the main Russian intelligence service, the F.S.B., was declared a target by the group. A few hours later, a picture was posted to the I.T. Army Telegram channel showing it had been taken down, a claim that could not be independently verified.                                                                                                                                                                  , “They could not overcome your attacks,” the group said on Telegram, a message that was reposted by Mr. Fedorov.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The worst fears of military analysts and cybersecurity experts — that Russia would use devastating cyberattacks to take down critical Ukrainian infrastructure like energy, government services and internet access — have not yet occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Yet the involvement of nongovernment groups could escalate quickly and cause unintended consequences, experts warned. A malware attack against one target could quickly spill over and become uncontrollable, as it did during a 2017 attack on Ukrainian government and business computer systems. Or a government might mistake an amateur attack for a state-backed one and decide to retaliate.                                              , “In this quickly escalating situation they are taking steps on behalf of the government that can have very serious repercussions on civilians. This is the big risk,” said Klara Jordan, chief public policy officer at CyberPeace Institute in Geneva.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Alex Holden, who founded the cybersecurity firm Hold Security and who has studied Russian ransomware groups, said attacks by volunteers on the Russian government were likely to draw a stiff response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “Those that support the Russian government and their invasion in Ukraine are preparing their retaliation against a number of different targets,” Mr. Holden said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In a Telegram channel called Russian Cyber Front, pro-Russia hackers were instructed to target a Ukrainian government website through which citizens can access digital copies of their drivers’ licenses, passports and other documentation. “Attack those who threaten our I.T. infrastructure and dare to attack our resources,” the channel instructed. It was not clear whether their efforts succeeded.                                    , Over the past two weeks, there have been a number of cyberattacks of Ukrainian targets without clear attribution of who was behind the assaults, according to CyberPeace Institute, which has been tracking cybersecurity events in the war.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Malware linked to Russia targeted Ukrainian government computer systems in the days before the invasion, Microsoft said this week, and Ukrainian officials said Russia was likely behind another attack that took down some mobile services. There have been unattributed attacks against an English-language news outlet, the Kyiv Post, and a border control station where people were fleeing into Romania, according to CyberPeace Institute., Last week, a ransomware group known as Conti declared its support for Russia. “If anybody will decide to organize a cyberattack or any war activities against Russia, we are going to use our all possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy,” the group, which is known for capturing corporate data and charging companies to return it, said in a blog post.                                               , But days later, internal files from Conti began to leak online — the apparent result of a hacking operation. The files exposed discussions among members of the group and some of the digital wallets they used to hold cryptocurrency.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In neighboring Belarus, a hacktivist group called Belarusian Cyber Partisans said it had targeted train services in Belarus that were carrying Russian military supplies toward Ukraine, though there was not independent verification of whether the work was successful.                                                                                                                                                                       , Cyber Partisans, formed in 2020 to oppose the authoritarian government of President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, has become a model for hacktivists for leaking troves of information from government and police databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , After Russia began using Belarus as a staging area for the invasion, the group began working with Ukrainian activists, lending technical support and helping recruit new volunteers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “This is war and you fight back,” said Yuliana Shemetovets, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for the Cyber Partisans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ukraine finance minister calls for 'severe' sanctions </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Western governments must "step up sanctions against Russia", with timing of the essence in Ukraine.                                                                                                                      , That's the message from its Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko, who spoke to the BBC from an undisclosed location in the country on Friday.                                                                               , "I don't think it's enough," he said of current sanctions, adding that this week he had asked G7 leaders for more restrictive ones to be introduced.                                                                     , "For us it's not just words, time is very important."                                                                                                                                                                    , He also described Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as a "crucial and very important object within our country", after some of its buildings were hit by shelling by Russian forces.                                  , Russia attacked and has seized control of Europe's largest nuclear plant, but international monitors says no radioactive material was released during the attack and the plant is safe.                                  , During the interview, Mr Marchenko also called on investors to ditch Russian assets.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gas prices hit new record sparking fears over bill rises </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A jump in the price of gas amid the Ukraine conflict has added to worries that annual UK household energy bills could reach £3,000.                                                                                                                                                                                           , The cost of gas in Europe and the UK has hit record levels as fears persist that Russian supplies could be reduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Higher costs for aluminium and copper also means UK shoppers are likely to face further price rises, the head of the London Metal Exchange has said.                                                                                                                                                                          , Economists have warned inflation, which tracks the cost of living, may hit 10%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Wholesale markets are where UK energy suppliers buy their gas to sell on to consumers. On Friday, wholesale gas prices for delivery to UK supplier jumped to 508p per therm. If prices remain high for long periods it will push up household bills, adding to cost of living pressures.                                      , Over the past few days, gas prices have been extremely volatile, but the trend has been upwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , On Thursday, an industry body warned that UK household energy bills could reach as high as £3,000 a year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , In addition, the recent surge in the cost of metals is also likely to push up the prices of some goods. Copper prices are at five-year highs, and other commodities have jumped in price since the Ukraine conflict began.                                                                                                    , Matthew Chamberlain, who leads the London Metal Exchange, told the BBC's Today programme that prices for canned goods and copper wiring may rise.                                                                                                                                                                             , "We've seen aluminium and nickel up 30% since the beginning of the year, and that will ultimately be passed on to consumers when you buy your drinks can made of aluminium, or when you make renovations to your house and you need copper for your wiring, all of those prices do go into the overall inflationary pressure.", Panmure Gordon economist Simon French told the BBC that the UK's inflation rate could now hit 10%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Sarah Hewin, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, agreed, warning that with rising gas prices feeding into higher energy bills, and increasing petrol and food prices, it was "entirely feasible" that inflation could move beyond the 7.5% rate that the Bank of England has predicted for April.                  , "Russia and Ukraine are important grain producers so we're likely to food prices rising here in the UK as well," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "Overall, food, energy and transport account for around 25% of consumer prices. It's possible, if the crisis continues in the coming weeks, and even months, that inflation could move up to double digits in the UK".                                                                                                        , UK petrol prices have hit another record, with the average price of a litre of petrol reaching £1.53 a litre, while diesel reached £1.57 a litre.                                                                                                                                                                             , This week, the price of Brent crude - the global oil benchmark - surged to more than $119 a barrel at one point, the highest since May 2012. On Friday, it was trading at around $114 a barrel.                                                                                                                               , Stock markets across Europe tumbled on Friday following sharp falls in Asia after a fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the largest in Europe.                                                                                                                                                 , London's FTSE 100 closed 3.5% down while France's CAC-40 index dropped 5% and Germany's Dax also fell 4.4%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Reflecting the sharp rise in commodity prices, Anglo-Russian gold producer Polymetal saw its share price in London jump by more than 25%. Evraz, the Russian steel-maker which counts oligarch Roman Abramovich as a major shareholder, also saw its share price jump by 23%.                                                 , The fire at the Ukraine nuclear power plant happened after Russia troops shelled the site. Some investor concerns were eased after officials said the plant's safety was "secured".                                                                                                                                           , The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later said that it had spoken to Ukraine's leadership and had been told important equipment at the plant was still working.                                                                                                                                                     , The shelling has drawn international condemnation, with the US President Joe Biden joining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in urging Russia to cease the shelling and allow firefighters to access the site.                                                                                                           , In recent days, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent shockwaves through the global financial and energy markets, as investors try to understand the implications of sanctions and supply chain disruptions.                                                                                                                  , The price of gold, which is regarded as a safer asset in times of uncertainty, has increased by 7.3% in a month to $1,938 per ounce.                                                                                                                                                                                          , The Russian rouble has hit a record low against the US dollar as countries around the world impose tough sanctions on the country.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Meanwhile, more British executives are bowing to pressure to quit Russian companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , James Rutherford on Thursday became the latest UK national to step down from a Russian company's board, resigning from the Roman Abramovich-backed steel firm Evraz.                                                                                                                                                          , It came after the business group the Institute of Directors called on Britons to resign from the boards of Russian companies, due to the invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                 , Sir Ian McKellen opens up in a probing interview with Amol Rajan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Panorama reports on the conflict in Ukraine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Can the Fraud Squad catch those responsible?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , © 2022 BBC.

The financial sector fell 6%, led by UniCredit (-15%) after the lender suspended its efforts to buy Banco BPM (-8.7%) due to UniCredit’s heavy losses since the start of Russia’s invasion. The bank has lost over 28% of its value on the week. At the same time, Telecom Italia (-15.6%) continued to plunge, as investors digested the company’s record EUR 8.7 billion loss in 2021 and the rejection of KKR’s acquisition bid of EUR 10.8 billion, as it prepares to spin-off its its landline network assets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The JSE FTSE All Share index slipped 3.4% to close at 74,734 on Friday, its biggest daily decline since January 24th, with heavyweights tech Naspers and Prosus leading the losses, amid concerns over escalating tensions in Ukraine. There were reports that Russian troops had caused a fire at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, raising fears of an unprecedented nuclear disaster. At the same time, traders continued to worry about the impact of the conflict on inflation and global economic growth. Meanwhile, the US Embassy in South Africa has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s administration to take a tougher stance on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, moving from a neutral position. Locally, South Africa's state-owned power utility Eskom has been warning consumers the power system is under severe pressure and this could trigger rolling blackouts if consumption is not drastically reduced. For the week, the JSE ended 0.7% higher. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NYC to suspend vaccination requirement for indoor venues, and mask requirement for schools  - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Friday that the "Key to NYC" rules will be suspended starting March 7, leading to the lifting of several COVID-19 pandemic restrictions give rapidly declining cases and hospitalizations in the city. Adams said indoor venues, including restaurants, fitness facilities and entertainment spaces, will not longer require proof of vaccination, but can continue to require vaccination if those businesses choose. In addition, face masks will no longer be required in schools for kindergarten to 12-grade students, but will continue to be required for setting with children under five years old, given that they are still ineligible for vaccines. Meanwhile, Adams said all other COVID-19 mandates will remain in effect, including the requirement of employees to be vaccinated unless they have received "reasonable accommodation" from their employer. "Today, we turn the page on this chapter in our fight against COVID-19," Adams said., "As towering skyscrapers rose in Moscow atop a pile of oil cash, Putin’s government became more backward-looking and more isolated," Lukas I. Alpert writes in a commentary piece.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Copper futures skyrocketed above $4.91 for the first time on record amid lingering worries of supply disruptions due to war in Ukraine and historically low inventories. Copper stocks held by LME were at 68,825 tonnes, the lowest level since 2005. In February, those in the Shanghai Futures Exchange and Comex were below 200,000 tonnes. Suppliers are especially low in Europe and although Russia accounts only for 4% of global production Europe is the primary export market. Adding to woes, the world's biggest producer Chile, recorded its lowest January output since 2011, with production sinking 15% compared to December and 7.5% from January 2021. On the other side, copper usage is surging, especially in developed countries, with increasing demand for electric vehicles, wind farms, solar panels, and power grids. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago Fed's Charles Evans cautions on inflation's hit to small businesses </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Small businesses will be facing growing challenges from inflation and higher wages, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Even with average earnings flattening out in February, Evans told CNBC, he hears from smaller companies in his district about the challenges from cost increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "I think there are a lot of business models, especially for small businesses, that are going to be challenged for the future," the central bank official told CNBC's Steve Liesman during a "Squawk Box" interview. "They're going to be asked to pay higher wages, and you know if inflation is going up, it's the real wage that's going to equate demand and supply.", Evans spoke just after the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added 678,000 nonfarm jobs in February, which is considerably higher than expected. The count also indicated that wages rose little over the month and were up 5.1% from a year ago, though that was less than the Wall Street estimate.                             , Still, even that yearly level is well ahead of anything the economy experienced prior to the Covid pandemic, and Evans said it will exert pressure. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge shows that inflation, even excluding food and energy prices, is running at its fastest pace since the early 1980s.                                                              , "Wages are going to go up. If rents are going up, gas is going up, food costs are going up, and there are a lot of businesses where margins are very thin," he said. "Can they really survive that?"                                                                                                                                                                    , Though Evans generally favors less-restrictive Fed policy, he said inflation has rendered the current stance, in which benchmark short-term rates are being held near zero, as "wrong-footed."                                                                                                                                                                          , As such, he likely will be among the majority of members this month to vote to raise rates a quarter-percentage point and continue to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Obviously, we need to be moving toward a more neutral monetary policy certainly by the end of the year, so that we're within striking distance of taking a position that would deal more forcefully with inflation," Evans said. "I have said 'wrong-footed' [on policy], and I think that's the right term. It happened very quickly."                                , Markets currently expect six 25-basis-point rate hikes this year. Evans said he's not sure the Fed needs to be that aggressive and the central bank will have a better idea of where it needs to be by the end of the year.                                                                                                                                             , Got a confidential news tip?

        MRMD,
        +2.68%,
       which trades on the OTC. Semple rated the stock a speculative buy and set a 12-month target price of $1.50 a share for MariMed, which has grown cannabis revenue by more than seven times in the past two years. "We believe the management team are capable operators, as evidenced by the strong growth achieved in cannabis revenues, an impressive sales per store metric (annualized run rate of $18.8 million per store on average in Q321) and MariMed's track record of having generated positive free cash flow in each of the past seven quarters," Semple said in a research note. MariMed, which has a market cap of about $246.5 million, has seen its stock fall by 13.3% in 2022, compared to a drop of 22.9% by the AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Natural Gas at 4-Week High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures rose to a four-week high of $4.9 per million British thermal units on Friday, supported by strong overseas demand. Prices of natural gas in Europe hit record highs this week, while LNG spot charges in North Asia also rose to unprecedented levels, as concerns over Russian supplies intensified the competition for LNG shipments. With the title for top destination of US LNG cargoes belonging to Europe, traders in Asia were forced to ramp up prices in order to attract more shipments. Sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine added upside risks to an already tight global market, with Europe scrambling to refill its historically low inventory levels and reduce its dependency on Russian gas. Domestically, natural gas stocks shrank slightly more than expected last week, and sit below the 5-year average. For the week, the contract is set for a near 10% rise. </td>

Mr. Biden has called for investing $80 billion in the agency over a decade to help crack down on tax cheats, estimating that would raise $400 billion in tax revenue.                                                                                                                                    , But tax-averse Republicans, who have spent years cutting the agency’s budget, have seized on the I.R.S.’s problems as proof it should not be given more money or responsibility, with at least one lawmaker calling for the tax collector to be abolished.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Much of the agency’s current woes can be traced to those budget cuts, which have eroded the agency’s ability to function at a critical moment. Staffing shortages and antiquated technology have collided with a pandemic that kept much of the agency’s work force at home while the I.R.S. was turned into an economic relief spigot responsible for churning out checks and other stimulus payments to millions of Americans.                                                                                                                            , The agency’s work force of about 75,000 is the same size as it was in 1970. Its enforcement staff has fallen by over 30 percent since 2010, and audits of millionaires have declined by more than 70 percent. And its budget has declined by nearly 20 percent, when accounting for inflation, during the last decade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , At the same time, the tax code has become more byzantine, and the number of individuals filing tax returns has grown by about 7 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Washington research group. The federal government has had to wrestle with well-financed corporations using complex tax avoidance maneuvers and the rise of digital currencies, which have made transactions more opaque and harder to tax.                                                                                                 , “It’s clearly been starved,” said John Koskinen, who was I.R.S. commissioner during the Obama and Trump administrations. “Now the chickens are coming home to roost.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The I.R.S. is now beginning to try to recruit new staff. It recently secured hiring authority from the United States Office of Personnel Management for 10,000 positions, according to a person familiar with the matter, as it works to clear the backlog of returns. The funding for the new hires, who will be brought on over two years, comes from the existing I.R.S. budget. The agency got a funding boost of more than $1 billion to go toward improving taxpayer services as part of the pandemic relief legislation that Congress passed in 2021., The I.R.S. expects to process 160 million 2021 tax returns this year. About 90 percent of those are filed electronically and flow relatively smoothly through its systems. But about 24 million paper tax returns, amended filings from previous years and other mail correspondence continue to clog its creaky systems and represent what the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent watchdog within the I.R.S., describes as the agency’s “kryptonite.”                                                                                              , Much of that paper flows through Kansas City, which is the agency’s primary paper processing center. Housed in the city’s old post office building, the center is set up like a giant warehouse, with people working at long tables and in cubicles as shipments of filings are delivered. Machines slice open envelopes that then must be stamped by hand and recorded into the I.R.S.’s main database. The method for tracking down old filings is reminiscent of the Dewey Decimal System.                                                               , At a recent I.R.S. town hall attended by a senior Biden administration official, staff pleaded for new filing boxes, better staplers and more computers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Gunn describes himself and his fellow clerks as foot soldiers of tax forms, opening upward of 500 envelopes per day to sort checks, letters and filings that must be funneled to the correct team of tax examiners. The job is often thankless and frustrating as a result of the lack of resources at the I.R.S.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “A surprisingly large amount of time has been used looking for carts to put files on and staples for stapling files together,” Mr. Gunn said in an interview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The I.R.S. has tried to respond to some of its challenges. It has redeployed staff to areas of need and tried to adopt new technology. But that has also caused problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A new facial recognition system put in place last year to identify taxpayers trying to access their accounts — which the I.R.S. said was intended to address concerns about data security —  wound up backfiring, with lawmakers and activists claiming it was an invasion of privacy. After spending $86 million on the project, the I.R.S. came under pressure to abandon the program and develop an alternative in the middle of tax season.                                                                                                             , The agency’s problems are rippling across the country, as angry taxpayers experience long delays getting their refunds and calls to the I.R.S. go unanswered. According to the taxpayer advocate, just 11 percent of the 282 million calls to the I.R.S. reached a customer service agent last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Adding to the pain: A hodgepodge of data storage systems that do not communicate with each other has handicapped customer service workers at the I.R.S., who often cannot determine why a tax return has stalled in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Jordan Stenger, a student at Upper Iowa State University, filed an amended tax return last spring when he realized that he was eligible for a $2,600 tax credit to offset higher education expenses. He still has not received his refund and follows up with the I.R.S. by telephone every 30 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Sometimes Mr. Stenger meanders through a maze of automated prompts that eventually go silent. At times he has waited over an hour to finally reach a representative, only to be told about the backlog the agency is facing and to call again in another 30 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “It’s unbelievably frustrating,” said Mr. Stenger, 23, who hoped to put the refund toward a down payment on a home. “The reality is it’s my money. They’re always quick to take it, then when I want it back it’s on their schedule.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The Biden administration insists that Republicans are to blame for the woes of the I.R.S. and the frustration gripping taxpayers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Over the past decade, the IRS budget has been decimated, resulting in an agency that every American relies on being starved,” said Alexandra LaManna, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which oversees the I.R.S. “Some members of Congress have politicized the issue and blocked common-sense advancements, like hiring more people to process tax returns and modernizing technology for partisan ideological reasons.”                                                                                                                        , Legislation that would significantly boost I.R.S. funding remains stalled in the Senate, and Republicans have no intention of giving in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , At a hearing in February, Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, argued that I.R.S. funding had generally kept pace with inflation and said that the agency’s problems were mostly the result of the pandemic and its inability to update its technology, making it difficult to communicate with taxpayers. He criticized the Biden administration for seeking funding to hire an “army of new auditors.”                                                                                                                                                , Some Republicans want to further gut the I.R.S. Senator Rick Scott of Florida proposed cutting the agency’s funding and work force by 50 percent in his new plan to “rescue America.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr. Koskinen, the former I.R.S. commissioner, argues that efforts to deplete the I.R.S. provides another opening for tax cheats. He lamented that Republicans have led the charge to block funding in the name of shrinking the government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “You’re basically saying you want to provide the government with fewer funds with which to operate,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The deterioration of the I.R.S. poses deeper problem for the United States economy, says Erin Collins, the National Taxpayer Advocate, who argues that a reliable stream of funding and a technology overhaul should be priorities for an agency that is playing an increasing role as an organ of social welfare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “It is a vital organization, and it performs a really important mission, not only in tax administration,” Ms. Collins said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The I.R.S. has been trying to address some of its problems, but it has been a struggle. In February, it reversed plans to shutter its processing center in Austin, Texas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But the meager salaries and stressful working conditions can make it hard to attract talent, particularly when private-sector companies such as Amazon can offer more money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , A report released last month by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that the I.R.S. was only able to hire two-thirds of the new employees it was trying to recruit last year. The report cited pay and the lengthy onboarding process for the shortfall.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the 10-year OFZ treasury bond surged to an all-time high of 19.8% in the last week of March in a thin trading environment due to suspended activity in the Moscow Exchange, amid a vast sell-off of Russian assets as escalated Russian attacks in Ukraine led to harsh retaliatory sanctions from the West. Measures aimed at isolating Russia from the global financial system weighed on the country’s economy, leading S&amp;P to cut Russia’s rating deeper into the “junk” territory, after Fitch and Moody’s had already downgraded Russian sovereign bonds ratings by six notches this week. Also, a plunging ruble led the Central Bank of Russia to hike its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% in an emergency move, while the banking system’s liquidity shortage widened to RUB 7 trillion. The tumble in Russian bonds comes despite the country's National Wealth Fund’s pledge to buy OFZ instruments while the Ministry of Finance said it planned to ban foreign investors from selling Russian assets. </td>

The US slapped sanctions on Russia’s oil refineries but traders have bought less oil from the country on growing concerns that Western nations will target Russia’s energy exports over its invasion and ongoing aggression in Ukraine. The ban could restrict access to roughly 8% of the global oil supply. Meanwhile, OPEC+ will stick to the planned output increase of 400,00 bpd in April despite growing concerns about prices approaching demand-destruction levels. Finally, EIA data showed both domestic crude oil and heating oil inventories shrank, with storage levels at key Cushing, Oklahoma crude hub at 2018 lows.

Diplomatic efforts have failed to end chaos in the country, eight days after Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade.                                                                                                                                                                           , The situation inside Ukraine seems unlikely to improve any time soon. A 40-mile Russian convoy headed for the capital, Kyiv, has been stalled for days as Ukrainian fighters hold key areas, while Russian troops have claimed other key strategic areas and, as of this morning, are occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.                                                                                    , Despite the bleak situation on the ground, NATO is unwilling to get directly involved in the conflict -- including setting up a no-fly zone -- beyond supporting Ukraine's resistance to an invasion that is killing innocent civilians.                                                                                                                                                                                 , NATO's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Friday that a no-fly zone over Ukraine is not an option being considered by the alliance. "We've agreed that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory," he said.                                                                                                                                       , What is NATO?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a group of 30 North American and European nations. According to NATO, its purpose "is to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means."                                                                                                                                                                                              , The alliance was created in 1949 in response to the start of the Cold War. Its original purpose was to protect the West from the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Since the end of the Cold War, many former Soviet nations have joined NATO, much to the annoyance of Putin.                                                                                                                                           , What does being a member of NATO mean?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Being part of NATO means taking an active role in daily discussions on security and defense matters affecting the alliance. This could range from strategic measures to combat cyberwarfare to moving troops within NATO's borders to protect other members, as has happened during this crisis.                                                                                                                         , Members are supposed to spend 2% of national GDP on defense each year, although few members have done so in recent years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The best-known aspect of the alliance is Article 5 of the treaty, which, if invoked, means "an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Article 5 has only ever been invoked once, in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , However, the alliance can take collective defense measures without invoking Article 5, and points out that it has done this in the light of the Russian attack on Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , What is a no-fly zone?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine.                                                                                                                              , NATO has imposed no-fly zones in non-member countries before, including Bosnia and Libya. However, it is always a controversial move because it means getting semi-involved in a conflict without fully committing ground forces.                                                                                                                                                                                        , What would happen if NATO imposed a no-fly zone?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict.                                            , Why hasn't NATO imposed a no-fly zone?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Neither Ukraine nor Russia is a member of NATO. Putin clearly sees NATO as a direct threat to his authority and has recently criticized its expansion toward Russia, using it as justification for his invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                              , As a result, NATO is extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict with a rival nuclear power. While it supports Ukraine's resistance and recognizes Putin's actions as an invasion of a sovereign nation, the alliance is simply not prepared to do anything that could be interpreted as a direct act of war on Russia and risk an escalation that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. , Why does Russia feel threatened by NATO?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Putin has long believed that Russia got a bad deal after the breakup of the Soviet Union -- something he has called the "greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , He has complained that NATO has, over time, expanded its borders by admitting Eastern European countries that were once part of the Soviet Union -- meaning Russia now shares a land border with the world's largest military alliance, thus reducing his geopolitical power in what was once Moscow's sphere of influence.                                                                                              , As recently as February, he was demanding that NATO scaled back to the borders of 1997, before the Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the latter two of which border Russia, joined the alliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Investors Rush to Safety of Government Bonds </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US and Euro Zone government bond yields declined on Friday as investors rushed into safe-haven assets amid lingering tensions in eastern Europe after Russian forces took over Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The move comes despite a better than expected US labor report which brought forward the expectations of more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve. The Fed, the world's most powerful rate-setter, is seen starting its policy tightening cycle in March with a 25 basis point rate hike. The US yield on the 10-year note plunged below 1.80%. In Europe, Germany's 10-year Bund yield, the benchmark for the region, was down ten basis points at -0.08%, the lowest since January. Italy's 10-year spread, an important gauge of risk in eurozone bond markets owing to the vast scale of Italian debt, narrowed to more than 1.56 percentage points. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, fell over 1% to around 113,460 on Friday, in line with its global counterparts, amid concerns over escalating tensions in Ukraine. Risk aversion increased after Russian troops last night occupied the area of Ukraine's Zaporizhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, briefly igniting a fire that was later extinguished. Meanwhile, investors digested the stronger-than-expected US payrolls which failed to calm markets. On the domestic economic front, Brazil's economy advanced 0.5% on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2021, above market estimates of a 0.1% rise and officially exiting a mild recession. Considering the full year of 2021, the Brazilian economy advanced 4.6%, the most since 2010, recovering from a 3.9% pandemic-induced slump in 2020. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russian Ruble at Record Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Russian ruble weakened to 118 per USD on Friday, a fresh record low, as continued Russian attacks on Ukraine and consequent Western sanctions extended the plunge in Russian assets. S&amp;P cut Russia’s rating deeper into the “junk” territory, after Fitch and Moody’s had already downgraded Russian sovereign bonds ratings by six notches this week, leading Russian securities to be suspended from trading in the London Stock Exchange and cut widely tracked indexes by MSCI. Western allies largely limited Russian entities' ability to transact internationally after agreeing to remove key Russian banks from the SWIFT interbank system and freezing the assets of the central bank. The tumble came despite strong efforts of stabilization by the CBR, as the bank raised its key policy rate to 20% from 9.5%, banned foreigners from selling Russian securities, and mandated Russian brokers to charge 30% in commission to individuals for the purchase of foreign currencies. </td>

The largest nuclear plant in Europe, in southern Ukraine, became the center stage of the war against the invading Russia, causing a fire in one of the buildings, although there was no official data pointing to an increase in radiation. The US called the attack a war crime, as traders prepared for worst case scenarios. On the data front, Japan’s jobless rate inched higher to 2.8% in January, compared with market expectations of 2.7%, amid the Omicron-led virus wave. On the week, the JGB 10Y Yield is on track to end marginally lower. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The UK natural gas rally gained momentum and hit a fresh all-time high of 508 pence a therm before capping gains at 460 pence on Friday, as competition for LNG supplies with Asia increases amid growing fears over Russian supplies. As European utilities scrambled for LNG shipments to replace Russian supplies, traders in Asia were forced to ramp up prices to record highs this week, in order to attract more shipments. Other upside risks stemmed mainly from the possibility that Western nations would slap sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, which supplies roughly 4% of the UK’s natural gas. On the other hand, the supply cuts may come from Russia and Belarus in retaliation for the harsh economic sanctions in place. The contract surged mroe than 100% on the week. </td>

It also estimated that more than half (58 percent) of the debt that appears on credit reports as being in collection stems from medical bills, a proportion that Mr. Chopra deemed “extraordinary.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “Having a medical debt collection mark on a credit record can make it harder to get credit, rent or buy a home or find a job,” Mr. Chopra said. “Families are pushed into bankruptcy by medical debts that they cannot pay.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Black and Hispanic people, as well as low-income and younger adults, have higher rates of medical debt than the overall population, the report noted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , As a result, the agency will be “scrutinizing” the three major credit reporting bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — and their handling of medical debt to make sure it is accurately reported in consumer files, Mr. Chopra said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Medical debt, unlike a mortgage or car loan, is often incurred involuntarily. People get sick or are injured in accidents and may end up with a bill they can’t afford. Several prior reports, including one last year in JAMA, have suggested that medical debt is becoming even more worrisome, particularly in states that haven’t expanded Medicaid coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Now, the bureau is being more assertive in tackling medical debt under Mr. Chopra, who was confirmed in October as the agency’s director.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Doctors and hospitals typically don’t report late payments directly to credit bureaus, but they may eventually send past-due accounts to outside collection agencies. If patients can’t pay the bill, the bill collectors may report the debt to the credit bureaus. The debt can then tarnish patients’ credit files and potentially their credit score, which is calculated based on information in the report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Credit reports and scores are used by lenders to determine if you qualify for a loan, and what interest rate you pay. Employers and landlords use them to screen applicants for jobs and apartments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Of particular concern, the report said, is that collection agencies may be reporting inaccurate data to the credit bureaus. If bad data is “polluting” consumer credit reports, Mr. Chopra said, the credit bureaus should cut off the agencies furnishing the faulty information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The bureau’s determination on whether credit bureaus should include medical debt on consumer credit reports will be based, Mr. Chopra said, on “additional research on medical billing, collections and reporting.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Jack Brown III, a board member of ACA International, an industry group for collection companies, said in a prepared statement: “We stand with the CFPB in our desire to not have a consumer’s credit report include bills that should have been paid by insurance companies.” But, he added, the bureau’s report doesn’t focus on what he called “significant problems” with insurance companies’ claim payment processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Francis Creighton, president and chief executive of the Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit bureaus, said banning all medical debt from credit reports could backfire because lenders need a full picture of an applicant’s credit profile. Some medical debt may not arise from emergency treatment, but from elective procedures like dental teeth whitening or cosmetic surgery, he said. “I don’t think it makes sense to eliminate all medical debt.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Rather, Mr. Creighton said, the approach to medical billing must be streamlined. “The medical payment system is just broken,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Here are some questions and answers about medical debt:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , You typically have more time before a delinquent medical bill ends up on your credit report than with other types of debt because medical billing is complex and often involves insurance companies. Since 2017, the credit bureaus have instructed collection agencies to wait at least 180 days — roughly six months — from the time a bill becomes delinquent before reporting it, Mr. Creighton said. (The policy stems from a legal settlement with a group of state attorneys general.)                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “Don’t panic,” said Caitlin Donovan, the spokeswoman for the Patient Advocate Foundation. Begin by checking if the bill is accurate. This usually means comparing it with an “explanation of benefits” from your health insurer (if you have coverage) or contacting the provider for clarification. The so-called EOB usually states that it is “not a bill” so people sometimes ignore them. “Don’t,” Ms. Donovan said. The benefit statement is proof that your insurer has been billed and gives you information to help challenge questionable charges. In some cases, Ms. Donovan said, hospitals may mistakenly send bills directly to the patient rather than billing the insurer first.   , If the bill is accurate, call the provider’s billing office and ask about monthly payment plans. Also, many hospitals have programs to help low-income people pay medical bills — but they may not mention them unless you inquire. “You have to ask,” Ms. Donovan said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , It’s also worth asking if the provider will reduce the amount of the bill in exchange for a lump-sum payment, said Chi Chi Wu, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center. She recalled that she once called a provider to ask about a bill and, without any prompting, the billing representative offered a 25 percent discount if she paid in full immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Try to exhaust other options and negotiate the lowest bill possible before putting the balance on a credit card, consumer advocates say. Paying medical bills with a credit card and then failing to pay may be worse for your credit than not paying the bill in the first place. That’s because the latest versions of both the FICO and VantageScore credit scores ignore reports of medical debt that has already been paid and limit the effect of medical debt that remains unpaid, Ms. Wu said. Be aware, however, that not all lenders use the updated credit scoring systems, she said. Mortgage lenders, in particular, may use older versions that don’t treat medical debt differently., And, Ms. Wu said, some credit score users, like employers and landlords, may look at your full credit report, not just your score. So medical debt can still cause problems, even if it’s not reflected in your credit score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A law called the No Surprises Act, which took effect in January, put in place new consumer protections against surprise medical bills. Surprise bills may come when patients inadvertently get care from emergency rooms and doctors outside of their insurance plan’s network. (This happens in about one in five emergency room visits, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Peterson Center on Healthcare.) The federal government estimates that the law will apply to about 10 million out-of-network surprise bills a year.                                                                                                                                      , Advertisement </td>

The DXY has also benefited from some safe-haven bids from the Russia-Ukraine war.

The number of unemployed persons edged down by 243 thousand to 6.270 million. In February 2020, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, and the number of unemployed persons was 5.7 million.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The American economy added 678K jobs in February of 2022, the most in seven months and way above market forecasts of 400K. Job growth was widespread, led by leisure and hospitality (179K), namely food services and drinking places (124K) and accommodation (28K); professional and business services (95K), mainly temporary help services (36K), management of companies and enterprises (12K) and management and technical consulting services (10K); health care (64K); and construction (60K). That leaves employment 2.1 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level and many economists believe the job market could recover all the pandemic losses this year. Fed Chair recently said to Congress the labour market was "extremely tight", but the crisis in Ukraine poses new risks to the economic and inflation outlook. </td>

Okay...so let&amp;#39;s do some inflation investigation work here. 

According to the USDA:
&amp;quot;2021 retail food price inflation continued at same pace as 2020, but varied among food categories&amp;quot;

Hmm. Interesting. 🤔

But according to the very same USDA:
A big increase in benefits is on the way for Americans receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Aug. 16 released a re-evaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan, used to calculate Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. 

As a result, the average SNAP benefit – excluding additional funds provided as part of pandemic relief – will increase for Fiscal Year 2022 beginning on Oct. 1 this year, according to the agency. 
The reevaluation concluded that the cost of a nutritious, practical, cost-effective diet is 21% higher than the current Thrifty Food Plan&amp;quot;.

So why the 21% increase if food inflation is at the same pace as 2020? 🧐😲🤔

If inflation is hot, which we all know it will be, and if labor market is strong, which we all know it will be. 50bps fears come up again. Also, from technicals, key supports have been lost, lower highs formed on the recent bounce. PT is $410 on SPY and $315 on QQQ testing the lows as a support for this week. The Russia war contributes by providing places to rotate funds to, commodities and commodity based stocks/ETFs. So rather than hodling, folks are wanting to sell and get out. Looking for recent low to fall through as it approaches Fed meeting and then buying with a fury. Have a great weekend folks! </td>

If CPI is 7.8-8% then .. oops.. am sure manipulation is underway as we speak to show under 7.5%.

Somebody explain this to me, because I&amp;#39;m not getting it. 

So if I go to the grocery store and prices rise significantly 6 months ago, then rise again 3 months ago, then rise again this week...each time by 10-20%, how is that not hyperinflation?

At what point does inflation become hyperinflation? 

Because in my opinion, we&amp;#39;re there. This is making the 1980&amp;#39;s inflation look almost tame in comparison when you consider that savings accounts were paying 7% in interest. 

Now we have the same (arguably higher) inflation and interest is running 1-2% on savings and wage inflation is 3-4%.

So this is not hyperinflation how exactly?

And what are the powers that be doing about it from a policy perspective to actually help workers? Last I checked, they haven&amp;#39;t done a thing except implementing policies that are exacerbating the hyperinflation. </td>

Who do you think would enforce it? And how?

This would put NATO and Russian air defenses against each other, setting up the perfect scenario for full-scale war.

It is incredibly selfish and arrogant of the Ukrainian government to be requesting this No Fly Zone, damn well knowing the apocalyptic repercussions. </td>

Guys, bread was 5 CENTS 🪙 when my Grandma was a kid. Her house was only $10k. We all SHOULD know why that’s a silly comparison to today bc of inflation.

So why does inflation not count for gas prices 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐

Mainstream media and Twitter love to only show half the picture 🧐

Remember $4.11 in 2008 = $5.37 TODAY.

We won’t be NEAR TRUE HIGHS until The NATIONAL average is $1.50 higher.

As God&amp;#39;s plan comes to a final end, He will increase the knowledge of many who are seeking to understand what&amp;#39;s going on in those last days.  Biblically.

I can&amp;#39;t help but think He planned that so those watching can share an urgent warning with those who have yet to believe in His Son Jesus (as time gets that much shorter).

Okay...so let&amp;#39;s do some inflation investigation work here. 

According to the USDA:
&amp;quot;2021 retail food price inflation continued at same pace as 2020, but varied among food categories&amp;quot;

Hmm. Interesting. 🤔

But according to the very same USDA:
A big increase in benefits is on the way for Americans receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Aug. 16 released a re-evaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan, used to calculate Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. 

As a result, the average SNAP benefit – excluding additional funds provided as part of pandemic relief – will increase for Fiscal Year 2022 beginning on Oct. 1 this year, according to the agency. 
The reevaluation concluded that the cost of a nutritious, practical, cost-effective diet is 21% higher than the current Thrifty Food Plan&amp;quot;.

So why the 21% increase if food inflation is at the same pace as 2020? 🧐😲🤔

If inflation is hot, which we all know it will be, and if labor market is strong, which we all know it will be. 50bps fears come up again. Also, from technicals, key supports have been lost, lower highs formed on the recent bounce. PT is $410 on SPY and $315 on QQQ testing the lows as a support for this week. The Russia war contributes by providing places to rotate funds to, commodities and commodity based stocks/ETFs. So rather than hodling, folks are wanting to sell and get out. Looking for recent low to fall through as it approaches Fed meeting and then buying with a fury. Have a great weekend folks! </td>

The market initially thought that this war would not escalate and end in a few days. Now, not only it is getting worse, Europe may get involved. So, unless something drastically better happens tomorrow, we continue selling the “growth” names and move to “commodities” and “defense” stocks. Yes, the trend will reverse but not going to happen in meaningful way any time soon. 
Hopefully, we go back to peace time soon. </td>

Guys, bread was 5 CENTS 🪙 when my Grandma was a kid. Her house was only $10k. We all SHOULD know why that’s a silly comparison to today bc of inflation.

So why does inflation not count for gas prices 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐

Mainstream media and Twitter love to only show half the picture 🧐

Remember $4.11 in 2008 = $5.37 TODAY.

We won’t be NEAR TRUE HIGHS until The NATIONAL average is $1.50 higher.

As God&amp;#39;s plan comes to a final end, He will increase the knowledge of many who are seeking to understand what&amp;#39;s going on in those last days.  Biblically.

I can&amp;#39;t help but think He planned that so those watching can share an urgent warning with those who have yet to believe in His Son Jesus (as time gets that much shorter).

When the Trumpet sounds, will you hear it?

Friends, believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins, put your trust in Him from this day forward, and let today be the day of your salvation.  ♥️✝️♥️ </td>

Putin only knows how to further escalate the crisis by calling Sanctions a Declaration of War by Western Nations against Russia.

This guy wants to be put in the history books along with the Worlds most Ruthless Leaders of all time:

Attila the Hun
Genghis Khan
Timur
Queen Mary I
Vladimir Lenin
Joesph Stalin
Adolf Hitler
Mao Zedong
Idi Amin
Augusto Pinochet

I guess he doesn’t like to be on the opposite list with Nelson Mandela or Gandhi

Also, rough chart of LT channel (sans Post COVID spike for top line) and ST downtrend channel.  First, it rejected the top line of the downward trend channel.  Second, ST Lower line matches up with the LT top line around 12,000 in a couple weeks (around FOMC).  Doesn’t mean it’ll get there, but that’ll be -25% and critical to hold.
12,969 is -20% mark for Nasdaq (Nas100 roughly same %) and when I’ll place initial orders for my very LT annuity like portfolio (NUSI, QYLD).  At 12k, I’ll go with straight QQQ/QQQM and hope for a violent pop back up.  Below that and I hold the rest of my ammunition for a real bottom to form and buy BRK.A for decades long growth.

Though the Covid crash was shocking it was not too deep, just quick. We haven&amp;#39;t had a real bear market since the market recovered in 2009. What is the bull case? The fact stocks are cheaper now? Well stocks can get cheaper than you&amp;#39;d ever imagine in a self fulfilling downtrend.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $QQQ Weekly chart- currently price is below calc price and current pivot which is bearish. 
If we stay bearish, volume is close to its support pivot I calc the price for that support to be at 335  losing that will bring the next weekly price pivot into play at 325.42 and next calculated volume pivot ~ 323.67 
If we hold 335, we will be in neutral territory til we clear both the current price pivot 341.51and the calc price at 342.11 with resistance coming in at  the next upper volume pivot calculated at ~343.85 and the next upper price pivot at 351.80 
My thoughts...tech has a lot of hidden divergence built up and the vix looks primed for a move higher...next week I expect price to test 335 hold then move above the calc price at 342.11 getting bulls on board only to be rejected at the calculated volume resistance at ~343.85 and then fall hard to 335 and close below. Inflicting the max pain on bears early in the week and then bulls with the rug pull at the end of the week

I believe that Strong Joe Biden will go down as the greatest president of all time. He has gone toe to toe with Putin and come out on top.

He ended covid with his powerful vaccines.

Joe inherited a ton of inflation but his strong guidance to the federal reserve has stopped the inflation dead in its tracks.

Due to clever maneuvering by Joe, all of the inflation is now actually just because of supply chains, so as soon as whatever that is supposed to be straightens itself out we will be fine.

Joe is going to reduce the money supply, raise wages, raise taxes, raise government spending, raise input costs for American companies, and all of this will lower inflation so long as American companies do their part and lower prices.

at this point Joe has done so much, and every major problem we face will only be someone else&amp;#39;s fault if it doesn&amp;#39;t fix itself immediately. </td>

Since 1900, only one US president has won re-election with a recession occurring sometime in the last two years of their first term: William McKinley. Democrat Harry Truman won in 1948. But the recession that year only started in November, the same month that voting started. So it doesn&amp;#39;t count.

President Trump was the latest victim. 

If oil remains elevated, distruptions to supply chain, and inflation at 40 yr high, US would likely be in a recession by Q3/Q4 2023. Unemployment rates will rise as companies control inflation and rising rate driven expenses. Gross invest will also shrink.

Consumer spending comprises 70% of US GDP. No work, no spend. High price, no spend. 

US Presidential Election 2024 will be decided this year. Biden is running out of time. </td>

It&amp;#39;s one thing to be a bear but its another thing to be a dumb ass bear posting garbage. The bears eat for one month typically out of a year and then swear they are thr smartest people in thr room while betting against the market which goes up the vast majority of the time.  
 
So these clowns lose 75 to 80 percent of the time unless they bet with the bulls but claim they out smart the market and the bulls. And trust me, they aren&amp;#39;t betting with the bulls a lot as thier pride won&amp;#39;t allow them to. So they wind up positions like they are in now rooting for Russia to continue to wage war because its thier only hope of pushing the QQQs to below 310.  
 
I dont care about Ukraine one way or another because they have proven they are racist AF but it must be said, Bears are the most disgusting and dumbest investors on the planet.  
 
I would never root for bloodshed....

We have seen it 3 times before, and the positives are even stronger this time.  Price jumps to 2.60 to 3.10 and pulls back when news is not what short term investors want.  This quarter will demonstrate the best EBITDA results seen in a long time and show how debt requirements will be achieved.  If you wait to get in you will miss the 50% gain.  Put it on your calendar to buy before next announcement.  And if they have a PR before then that makes the price jump....oh well...missed it. </td>

My thoughts on the mkt next week ... 

There is a general sense of FOMO that is so clear in the mkt, because the mkt has trained almost everyone that all dips are buying opportunities, and we don&amp;#39;t want to miss out. But that isn&amp;#39;t the case. And I had pointed that out in a blog back on 1/8 that the game has changed. I can see it in the daily/short term charts. Where the EMAs were once automatic buy orders for the algos once they were hit on the downside, now they are automatic sell orders once hit on the upside. 

What is evident to me as a technician is a mkt that appears to be setting itself up for one more big swoosh down. That&amp;#39;s what it looks like. That is what it feels like for someone who has been doing this for decades. And that swoosh is what I want to buy. When the feeling of doom and gloom is so prevalent, I want to have my list ready. I just don&amp;#39;t think we are there yet. Sorry Farmer Jim. Sorry Mr. Tom Lee.

LIAR! LIAR!...PANTS ON FIRE!!! 
 
Back in September 2021 Biden extended the freeze on student loan repayment for the 5th and FINAL TIME...but here we are once again talking about extensions and even taxpayers picking up the bill for student loans just in time for mid-term elections. 
 
From the article: 
 
&amp;quot;Biden and White House officials have also said no; this will be the final such extension. Student loan experts tend to agree, and the Federal Student Aid office of the Department of Education also refers to this as the final extension.&amp;quot; 
 
&amp;quot;The most recent freeze extension largely had to do with the logistics of student loan servicer changes, rather than the economy or student loan hardship issues&amp;quot; 
 
“At this point, there wouldn’t be anything in the economy to justify a further extension, but more likely something in politics that would extend the freeze,”  
 
Like buying votes???

Biden is just like the FED...full of shit! 
 
Biden has now extended student loan repayment 6 TIMES with the last 3 being &amp;quot;final extensions&amp;quot;  
 
Supposedly the 5th extension was all about logistics....&amp;quot;Biden and White House officials have also said no; this will be the final such extension. Student loan experts tend to agree, and the Federal Student Aid office of the Department of Education also refers to this as the “final extension. The most recent freeze extension largely had to do with the logistics of student loan servicer changes, rather than the economy or student loan hardship issues&amp;quot; 
https://fortune.com/education/business/articles/2021/09/09/will-the-freeze-on-student-loan-payments-get-extended-again/ 
 
 Apparently our FULLY INEPT government couldn&amp;#39;t logistically figure out how to collect debt repayments. Imagine a bank or ANY private enterprise failing so miserably and still being in business. 
 
Now that a 6th extension is about to expire in May 2020 Biden is considering &amp;quot;forgiveness&amp;quot; just in time buy votes for mid-term elections. 
 
What a joke. </td>

2. Commodities hyper inflation, destroys tech growth. They can&amp;#39;t price gouge like the food companies, but have to pay higher wages...in a slowing economy?  
3. A once in 100 years pandemic happened, pushing historical QE into the market.  
4. Fed running their balance sheet off starting this month.  
5. Rate hikes starting this month and every seven weeks after that.  
6. Russia exposure 
7. World wide recession  
8. You get the point.

There is no waiting this out. This isn&amp;#39;t chess; there&amp;#39;s no draw, no stalemate. Either Putin destroys Ukraine and eventually hits NATO with an even greater catastrophe, or Putin falls in Russia. He cannot be stopped with weakness. 
 
Vladimir Putin told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée Palace  said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.”

We will know soon. Nobody ever fought the WEST in history and Russia and China asking for Balance Of Power. This war is part of it. if China starts anything with Taiwan.. we doomed. Nobody an fight both. World is dependent on China.. way toooo much.. look at OIL in 2 weeks.. </td>

Yes, shorting and manipulation is very much alive even during the war so it&amp;#39;s a double whammy, but ask yourself why the corrupt suits chose NIO if it has the best fundamentals and catalysts to come of all other EV brands, excluding $TSLA . It&amp;#39;s simple, retail has a stronghold of 50% and they want their shares badly. They know how weak retail becomes when margin calls start triggering, and they know where stops are set.
So all we can do is wait, and do what many Tesla Longs did, hold during the good and bad. Anyone that held 300 shares of Tesla at $50 just a few years ago is worth over 1 million. </td>

That we demand lying to us in media outlets or news is prosecutable crimes. That we demand the algorithms that define these markets are handed over to a third party to analyze. That we shouldnt have to pay taxes to own our own property. That house loans shld not be hard to get when we say credit cards can charge 25%. We need to stop believing we must live our lives in these neat modes of isolation reinforced by fake personas pasted on facebook amongst friends. That there is any reason at all anyone should starve to death when we can trash 3/4 of a burger because we only really wanted the fries. Where we stop judging each other and just focus on the change we can affect. ✌️ </td>

🚨🚨🚨

Urging all my Oklahomans back home to oppose House Bill 3994! 

This will force the closing of Tesla service centers &amp;amp; galleries, as well as prevent delivery to new customers in OK. Would prevent/stall growth of sustain energy &amp;amp; EVs, as well as jobs in OK.

Okies can change this! Thx!

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In 2013 $TSLA had 2 billion in revenue and a market cap of 18.5 billion. Fast forward 7 years and Tesla turns first profit, exploding to market cap of over 680 billion in 2020.

$TDOC in 2021 had 2 billion in revenue and now has a market cap of 10.7 billion. I doubt it will take anywhere close to 7 years for it to profit with 25-30% CAGR projected. After they digest the Livongo acquisition, sky is the limit over the next decade. </td>
