   <td style="text-align:left;"> These Asia stocks have fallen sharply since their 2021 IPOs, fading from their first day surges </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Some 2021 Asia-Pacific IPOs have seen a sharp reversal in their fortunes since their strong market debuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , At the top of the list is Chinese short video company and Tiktok-rival Kuaishou, which more than doubled from its issue price during its February debut. It was the only Asia listing among this year's top five largest IPOs globally by deal size, according to Morningstar.                                                             , As of Wednesday's market close in Hong Kong, however, the stock sat 77% below those first day gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Elsewhere, shares of Indonesian e-commerce firm Bukalapak have also tumbled hard after rising almost 25% on day one of trading. The stock is now 57% below those levels, as of Wednesday's close.                                                                                                                                          , Another Chinese stock that has plunged from its debut gains is JD Logistics, which raised more than $3 billion in its IPO. The stock was 36% below its first day closing price, based on its Wednesday close.                                                                                                                              , These are the 4 stocks to play the EV 'arms race,' according to one investment firm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Market gains may be harder to come by in 2022, but it could still be a positive year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Here are the top internet stock picks for 2022 as selected by Evercore ISI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Those losses follow a number of issues including Beijing's ongoing crackdown on China's tech sector, which led to giants like Alibaba and Meituan being slapped with massive fines.                                                                                                                                                        , U.S. Treasury yields have also risen as the Federal Reserve signals it will soon begin to normalize monetary policy. Under such conditions, investors tend to avoid stocks in sectors like tech. These stocks could be hurt by rising rates which affect a company's ability to fund growth and also makes future cash flows less valuable., The fast-spreading omicron Covid variant has also further weighed on investor sentiment in recent weeks and dampened risk appetite, with questions remaining over the new strain's potential economic impact.                                                                                                                              , To be sure, poor post-IPO performances are not unique to the region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In a December note, Pitchbook's James Thorne and Jordan Rubio highlighted blockbuster 2021 market debuts elsewhere in the world that have also fallen sharply since going public.                                                                                                                                                          , One of those examples was Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi, which announced early this month it will delist from the New York Stock Exchange less than six months after going public. It is also making plans for a Hong Kong debut instead amid reports of political pressure from Beijing.                                                 , Other U.S.-listed firms that saw mega IPOs such as Robinhood and South Korea's Coupang, have also "lost significant value," they said.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "This lackluster performance has led to a cooling off in the IPO market that has caused some new issuers to delay or downsize their IPO plans. When all is said and done, 2021 could represent a high point of the IPO market that may not be matched for years to come," said Thorne and Rubio.                                           , New York University's Aswath Damodaran told CNBC earlier this month that the post-IPO slumps could be due to some investors buying into "the big market delusion."                                                                                                                                                                         , Such investors are "not doing their homework" like examining the business models of these companies, with reality usually setting in as the first earnings report is released, the professor of finance at NYU's Stern School of Business explained.                                                                                       , "It's a slightly troubling sign, but by itself I don't think … it's a red flag. I think it's more a sign of the kinds of companies you've seen going public, many with small revenues, big losses and lots of potential," Damodaran said.                                                                                                  , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australian Shares Hover Near 4-Month High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index held above 7,500 on Thursday, hovering close to 4-month highs despite surging local Covid infections, as gains in Australian miners offset losses in technology stocks. Prime minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday that Australia needed a “gear change” to manage overburdened laboratories and get people out of isolation, with a plan to prioritize clinically urgent cases as infections surged across the country. A business group also called on state governments to continue easing Covid restrictions and ramp up use of rapid antigen tests to enable staff to return quickly to work. Australian miners supported the market with gains from BHP Group (1.6%), Pilbara Minerals (2.5%), Rio Tinto (1.2%), Mineral Resources (1.7%), AVZ Minerals (1.9%) and Syrah Resources (6.8%). As 2021 draws to a close, the benchmark index is set to add nearly 14% this year and reverse losses from the pandemic-battered 2020, boosted by record-low interest rates and monetary stimulus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures were little changed on Thursday after the Dow and S&amp;P 500 closed at new records in the previous session amid a thinly traded final week of 2021. Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 futures were mostly unchanged, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell about 0.2%. During regular trading on Wednesday the S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.14% to its 70th record close of the year. The Dow also rose 0.25%, its first record close since November, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.1%. The real estate, consumer defensive and healthcare sectors led the charge, with Biogen taking the spotlight after jumping 9.46% following reports that Samsung is in talks to acquire the company. Meanwhile, growth-oriented areas of the market stalled as Treasury yields crept higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield breaking above 1.5% on Wednesday, seen by analysts as a major headwind for equities in 2022. So far in the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 27.6%, the Nasdaq 22.3%, and the Dow Jones 19.2%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Prices paid for home and motor insurance are changing due to new rules coming into effect on 1 January to protect loyal and vulnerable consumers.                                                                                                                           , Anyone renewing their policy will pay no more than they would as a new customer, under regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).                                                                                                                            , That means prices for those who switch regularly will go up, while long-standing customers will pay less.                                                                                                                                                                   , The FCA said the move would save loyal customers £4.2bn over 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Brian Brown, consumer finance expert at market analysts Defaqto, said there was no sign of insurers leaving the market as a result, meaning customers still had plenty of choice of products.                                                                               , The policy is designed to end cases of "price walking", which is when a customer is charged more year after year, by staying with the same insurance company - even though their risk is no greater.                                                                        , When announcing its plans, the FCA pointed to an example in which a new customer for home insurance typically paid £130 for a year's cover.                                                                                                                                 , But for the same policy, having stayed with the same insurer for five years, that annual premium rose to £238.                                                                                                                                                              , For motor insurance, new customers paid £285 while people who have been with their provider for more than five years paid £370, according to the FCA's example.                                                                                                             , The new rules are being brought in by the FCA in the New Year following a super-complaint from Citizens Advice about the loyalty penalty.                                                                                                                                   , Those who switched have received the best deals as new customers. Those who stayed loyal were charged more.                                                                                                                                                                 , Around 10 million policies across home and motor insurance are held by people who have been with their provider for five years or more.                                                                                                                                     , Matthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, said: "Rip-off renewal prices have seen consumers paying over the odds for far too long. No longer can you be exploited just for staying loyal."                                                                      , He added that people tended to be at a disadvantage if they were older, on lower incomes, or unable to access the internet.                                                                                                                                                 , "We welcome the FCA's bold new rules on home and motor insurance. We now need to see urgent action to protect consumers in the other markets," he said.                                                                                                                     , People can still shop around for the best deals, and will need to consider whether the policy matches their requirements.                                                                                                                                                   , However, premiums charged to all renewing home and private motor insurance customers by their insurance provider cannot be greater than the price they would charge to an equivalent new customer for the equivalent policy.                                                , Individual premiums can still be set at different levels depending on factors such as a customer's age, type of vehicle, driving record and history of claims.                                                                                                              , James Dalton, from the Association of British Insurers, said: "While the FCA recognises that these changes could lead to price rises for some who shop around regularly, all customers should get fairer outcomes in the UK's competitive home and motor insurance markets.", In October, the FCA introduced new rules requiring insurers to look more closely at how they offer fair value for consumers.                                                                                                                                                , It should also be made easier for consumers to cancel automatic policy renewals, and home and motor insurance firms must report more data to the regulator.                                                                                                                 , The lads are on a Christmas quest to catch an elusive English salmon                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Who is the strange cloaked figure in The Mezzotint?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , © 2021 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)South Korea has "effectively" agreed with the United States on a draft declaring the end of the Korean War, according to South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong, as reported by South Korea's Yonhap News Agency on Wednesday.                   , Speaking at a news conference, Chung said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had reaffirmed the progress, saying that both sides have "effectively reached an agreement" on the draft.                                                                     , A US State Department spokesperson said the US has "no hostile intent" toward North Korea and is prepared to meet "without preconditions."                                                                                                                   , "We hope the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) will respond positively to our outreach. We continue to consult closely with the Republic of Korea, Japan, and other allies and partners about how to best engage the DPRK," the spokesperson said., The draft aims to end the Korean War, which broke out on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces stormed across the 38th parallel dividing North and South Korea.                                                                                            , The United States supplied about 90% of the troops who were sent to aid South Korea, spending around $67 billion on the war.                                                                                                                                 , An armistice signed on July 27, 1953, stopped the conflict, but the war never officially ended because there was no peace treaty.                                                                                                                            , In September, North Korean Vice Minister Ri Thae Song said South Korea's call to declare an end to the Korean War is "premature" due to "US hostile policy" toward Pyongyang.                                                                                , </td>

The S&amp;P 500 has notched a gain during the period — the last five trading days of the year followed by the first two session in January — 78.5% of the time since 1928, according to Bank of America.                                                          , "Santa has been good to investors this holiday season, and we look for another year of positive returns in 2022," said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , With just two trading days left in 2021, the major averages are also on track to end the year in the green. The S&amp;P and Dow are up 27.6% and 19.2%, respectively. The Nasdaq's gained 22.3%, while the Russell 2000 is up 13.9%.                                                                                                                                                                              , "2021 was a terrific year for the equity markets," said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist for Commonwealth Financial Network. "Between federal stimulus keeping the economy going, easy monetary policy from the Fed keeping markets liquid and interest rates low, and the ongoing medical improvement leading to surprising growth, markets have been in the best of all possible worlds," she added., Looking forward, Gaggar said 2022's performance depends on earnings and stock valuations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Treasury yields creeping higher could prove to be a headwind for 2022, especially among growth-oriented areas of the market. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury broke above 1.5% on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "We expect interest rates to move modestly higher in 2022 based on near-term inflation expectations above historical trends and improving growth expectations once the impact of COVID-19 variants recede," said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist for LPL Financial. "Our year-end 2022 forecast for the 10-year Treasury yield is 1.75–2.00%."                                                       , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Trump wants Supreme Court to read Washington Post interview with Bennie Thompson - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)As the Supreme Court considers whether to take up former President Donald Trump's January 6 White House records case, Trump's attorney submitted to the court a new filing Wednesday making the court aware of a Washington Post interview with Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House select committee seeking the records.                                   , In the interview, the Mississippi Democrat said that the committee's investigation into Trump's delay in calling for his supporters to end their rioting at the US Capitol could lead to a criminal referral to the Justice Department.                                                                                                                                  , "That dereliction of duty causes us real concern," Thompson told the Post. "And one of those concerns is that whether or not it was intentional, and whether or not that lack of attention for that longer period of time, would warrant a referral."                                                                                                                    , Thompson added: "I can assure you that if a criminal referral would be warranted, there would be no reluctance on the part of this committee to do that," according to the Post.                                                                                                                                                                                         , RELATED: The January 6 committee formed 6 months ago. Here's what it's uncovered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Trump's lawyers told the justices Wednesday that the comments back one of his case's key allegations: that the effort to obtain his White House records lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and thus should be blocked.                                                                                                                                               , "The Committee cannot make a mockery of Congress's constitutional mandate that its requests and investigation be supported by a 'valid legislative purpose,'" Trump's lawyers wrote. "It cannot embark on what is essentially a law enforcement investigation with the excuse that it might legislate based on information it turns up in the course of the exploration.", When the case was before the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump raised similar comments from the committee members about the possibility their investigation would expose wrongdoing by Trump.                                                                                                                                                                        , "The mere prospect that misconduct might be exposed does not make the Committee's request prosecutorial," the appeals court said earlier this month, rejecting the former President. "Missteps and misbehavior are common fodder for legislation."                                                                                                                       , The Supreme Court has not indicated how it intends to move forward with Trump's request to take up his case. The Democratic-run House and the Biden administration are expected to submit filings on Trump's request on Thursday.                                                                                                                                        , </td>

Still, in Canada, infections have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, with more than 2x times the daily infections seen at the peak of the April wave on Monday. Quebecois authorities said infected essential workers would continue to work in order to prevent severe staff shortages, a week after bars, gyms, and casinos were shut and restaurants were slapped with capacity constraints to curb the contagion rate of the virus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Dwayne Johnson reflects on his record-breaking year - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has plenty of reasons to toast 2021 with some Teremana.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , He produced and starred in two hit films, "Jungle Cruise" and "Red Notice," debuted his biographical sitcom "Young Rock," saw unprecedented sales growth with his Teremana tequila, and became the most followed American man on Instagram with 285 million followers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , At 49, with grit, charisma and determination to "deliver the goods," Johnson has segued from professional wrestler to movie star, major entrepreneur and someone nearly half of America would like to see as the next president of the United States, according to one poll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , CNN spoke with Johnson this week about his monumental year. He addressed hype around his possible return to the "Fast and Furious" franchise and his potential political ambitions. He also offered a glimpse at how he plans to top his blockbuster 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for flow and clarity, follows below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , You've seen some great successes, any highlights? Reflecting back, anything you wish you would have done differently?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "I worked hard, had some luck on my side and was able to accomplish a few things in 2021. A few highlights that come to mind, one would be completing two massive Seven Bucks Productions films, 'Red Notice' and 'Black Adam.' (Set for release in 2022.) Both presented a lot of challenges during Covid, but like so many businesses out there, we adjust, get clarity, create our new Covid strategy and get to work. Seven Bucks also just completed -- two weeks ago -- our second season of NBC's 'Young Rock.' I'm quite proud of everyone's efforts and talents to get the job done and deliver quality. And the other businesses in my portfolio have shown tremendous growth and moved along nicely in 2021 -- Teremana Tequila, ZOA Energy, Project Rock and XFL. As for anything I would've done differently in 2021, sure, I would've listened to my gut when it was telling me to slow down a bit. Enjoy these moments even more with your family and friends, because at the end of the day these joyful moments are the s*** that really matters in life. Sorry to cuss but that's the truth. Good lesson to always listen to that voice in your gut.", "Red Notice" received an enormous amount of praise, from both those in the industry and with audiences worldwide by becoming Netflix's most watched movie in the world for 2021, and most watched of all time. What do you think made "Red Notice" so successful?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "First thing, we made a great movie for families around the world to enjoy. That's the bottom line. Deliver the goods. I always say I can bring people to the dance and with the trust they have in me, they'll dance one song. But then it's up to the quality I'm offering that will make them dance all night.  We made a great movie and people are dancing to it. Rawson Thurber did a tremendous job of writing and directing 'Red Notice' that attracted two of the biggest stars in the world, in Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, and a dude who's only famous for his tattoos, raised eyebrow and a fanny pack. But dumb jokes aside, it's a monumental achievement for our Seven Bucks Productions to produce the most watched Netflix film of all time. 'Red Notice' was my first film on a streaming platform so it was critically important for myself and our Seven Bucks Company to deliver and move the streaming needle.

When a movie is done right, man it's pure magic in the theaters.

Our numbers were disclosed earlier this week and our Teremana growth is truly unprecedented. Our sales have exceeded over 600,000 nine-liter cases and in our spirits industry, that's an all-time record for first year sales. For context, George Clooney sold his Casamigos tequila brand to Diageo for $1 billion dollars and they were selling approximately 170,000 cases.  Teremana is currently selling over 600,000 cases. So you can extrapolate the math and valuation, astounding growth and I think it reflects our 'highest in quality and best in taste' mantra. I'm happy but not satisfied with what we've been able to accomplish with Teremana tequila thus far. The work is just beginning.

No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , I feel the best position I can be in right now is to be a trusted, nonjudgmental place for people; regardless of what side of the street you live on, what color you are, what you do for a living, how you choose to live your life, what your bank account says, whether you drive a car or take the bus. I don't care. None of that matters to me. Just work hard, take care of your family, be good to people, be kind to people, be straight up, honor your word and always [have] some fun along the way. And don't be an a**hole.

It's opened my eyes a bit more to real change that needs to my attention. Work flow, work stream, what and who in my life really need my attention, what truly should be getting me out of bed. I've reached a point in my life this past year where I realized just how vital the idea and essence of time is; who and what gets my time these days.  We don't get time back, so in 2022 and beyond, the people, the projects, the energy, the everything. Life.

With office, retail, and other property types hammered by the pandemic, the sector fell 8% last year compared with an increase of 18.4% for the S&amp;P 500, Green Street said.                                                                                                , Next year it is doubtful this year’s momentum can be maintained.

Concerns about the omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus already are dampening hopes that millions of people who have been working from home throughout the pandemic will return to offices in January.                                                                                              , REIT shares, like those of numerous other companies, also could face a bumpy ride in 2022 from inflation and rising interest rates. "Headline risk around additional variants, inflation and interest rates will create significant volatility over the next 12 months," said a December report on REITs by Evercore ISI.                               , A few property types have continued to thrive throughout the pandemic. For example, total returns of industrial REITs have been over 40% since the pandemic hit because of the rise in online retail sales, according to analysts.                                                                                                                      , Self storage warehouse with open red doors outside Marshall, Texas Americana.  (Visions of America/Universal Images Group via Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                              , Total returns of self-storage landlords have increased more than 80% during that same time frame as people working from home have decluttered, analysts said. "Folks wanted the extra space," said Michael Mueller, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. "They cleared out the back bedroom."                                                           , Meanwhile, REITS that own properties like office buildings, malls, senior housing, and hotels that depend on business travel have been tracking the ups and downs of the pandemic since early 2020. Their stocks have tumbled when new variants have appeared and soared with promising news about vaccines.                                            , "When you think of 2021, everything started with the vaccine news in November 2020," said Cedrik Lachance, Green Street’s head of research.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , PENDING HOME SALES FALL 2.2% IN NOVEMBER AS RISING PRICES MAKE BUYERS HESITANT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Good news about vaccines as 2021 began boosted the performance and share prices of some REITs faster than expected. For example, demand soared in the first half of 2021 for rental apartments in cities like New York and San Francisco that had seen an exodus of renters in 2020.                                                                    , Shoppers also surprised some analysts by returning to malls so quickly. For example, strong sales helped push the share price of Simon Property Group Inc., the largest mall owner in the U.S. to above $150 a share, which is where it was trading before the pandemic hit.                                                                            , Shoppers browse the stores at the Brookfield Place indoor mall on December 27, 2021 in New York City.  (Photo by Scott Heins/Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                               , The rise in inflation, so far, has been good for REITs because it has helped drive up mergers and acquisitions volume, as well as sales volume and values of individual properties. Many investors consider real estate an inflation hedge because owners can raise rents to stay ahead or at least keep pace with rising prices.                       , "If the cost of building real estate goes up because of inflation, you don’t have the ability to build more supply until rents get to a certain level to justify it," said Tony Paolone, analyst with JPMorgan.                                                                                                                                         , But inflation may be painful for highly leveraged property owners next year if it sparks sharply higher interest rate costs. Inflation and higher rates also could lead to an economic downturn and drops in demand for a range of property types.                                                                                                      , READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Health news in 2022 will be even more of a wild card for REITs, analysts say. Bad news will likely hurt property types like office and senior housing while helping REITs that specialize in data centers which see strong demand when people are sitting at home streaming movies and TV shows.                                                        , Good news will boost malls and hotels. Mr. Lachance, of Green Street, predicted a possible repeat of the "revenge spending and revenge traveling" that has occurred when infection rates have fallen. To get back at the virus, people "hit the mall and buy things because it makes them feel good," he said. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Melania Trump steps back into the public eye  - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)After months of relative public silence, former first lady Melania Trump before Christmas emerged from private life to announce a new project: A piece of artwork, a watercolor closeup of her eyes, in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) was now available for purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , It was an unusual move for any former first lady, to delve into the world of blockchain sales, but Trump has never been a predictable nor typical political spouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "I am proud to announce my new NFT endeavor, which embodies my passion for the arts, and will support my ongoing commitment to children through my Be Best initiative," said Trump in a statement released via her social media platforms and on her website. Trump has since posted on her Twitter account 17 times about the endeavor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Her NFT, entitled "Melania's Vision," and drawn by French artist Marc-Antoine Coulon, is available through December 31 through the cryptocurrency Solana, at a cost of approximately $175 -- depending on the market -- and has an authenticated identity via blockchain. The sales could be incredibly lucrative for Trump, one of several celebrities -- including Paris Hilton, Shawn Mendes, Tom Brady, Kate Moss and Grimes -- who have recently dipped into the NFT market and emerged hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars richer. Fans are often enticed by the opportunity to own a unique digital piece of memorabilia or original artwork., Trump's NFT also comes with an audio clip of her saying: "My vision is: Look forward with inspiration, strength and courage."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "Through this new technology-based initiative, we will provide children computer science skills, including programming and software development, to thrive after they age out of the foster care community," added Trump in Thursday's statement, noting not every dollar of profit is intended solely for her, yet neglecting to clarify how, when and to what extent the charitable component will be a part of the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Coulon, the artist, had perhaps been filled in on details the public has not, writing on his Instagram page: "The project has been clearly defined and its objectives and the charities involved are very much in line with the spirit in which the project was motivated." A spokesperson for Coulon did not return a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Trump's statement said "a portion of the proceeds" will go to children aging out of the foster care system, but no specifics on what that portion is were provided. Several attempts by CNN to reach Trump's spokesperson for clarity on these components of the NFT went unanswered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "I'm confused by it. It's very random as a project and seems tone deaf to release online artwork of yourself for $150," said a former White House official who worked with Melania Trump on several of her East Wing initiatives, and one of several acquaintances or former Trump staff who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity to maintain personal relationships. "The timing seems odd too -- Covid and natural disasters are impacting the country, and many people are struggling financially."                                                                                                                                                         , Trump, who embraces a wealthy lifestyle, has not indicated publicly, or privately to those who spoke to CNN, that she is in any financial need. "With Melania's personal wealth, I certainly hope the 'portion of proceeds' going to help kids is significant," said another person who worked with her for several years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , 'Why now?'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , When she left Washington in January, Trump re-embraced her fondness for a low-profile life, retreating to Palm Beach, where she now resides full-time at Mar-a-Lago.

        -21.07%
       plummeted at much as 58.6% intraday Wednesday, before paring losses to be down 27.4% in midday trading, after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the New York-based bank holding company and its Chief Operating Officer Andrew Murstein for engaging in "fraudulent schemes" to boost its stock price. The SEC's complaint alleges that from late 2014 through 2017, Medallion and Murstein engaged in "illegal touting" of its stock by paying media strategy company Ichabod's Cranium Inc. to place positive stories about the company on various websites, including Huffington Post, Seeking Alpha and TheStreet.com. Ichabod's Cranium and its owner Lawrence Meyers were also charged by the SEC. "With Murstein's knowledge, Meyers and others created fake identities so their opinion pieces would appear credible to potential investors," the SEC said in a statement. "The complaint further alleges that Medallion and Murstein fraudulently increased the carrying value of Medallion Bank (the Bank), a wholly owned subsidiary of Medallion, to offset losses relating to the taxicab medallion loans."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Italian Shares Edge Lower </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB erased early gains to close 0.4% lower at 27,344.25 on Wednesday, as stronger pandemic related restriction measures dented investors’ sentiment on economic growth. Italy’s daily case count hit a fresh record of 78.3 thousand yesterday, as quarantine periods from close contacts with infections were reduced to five days for vaccinated individuals, but extended to ten days for the unvaccinated. Health experts criticized the long quarantine times, stating the country could risk paralysis when the highly infectious Omicron strain should be dominant by January. At the moment, over 2.5 million people are estimated to be in isolation from close contact with positive cases. On the corporate front, energy stocks took the most losses, driven by Eni (-1%) and Saipem (-0.6%). Still, the FTSE MIB is on course to close 2021 hovering around 13-year highs at a 25% yearly increase. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago rough rice futures extended gains to a 17-month high of $14.7 per hundredweight in the last week of December, underpinned by an ongoing fertilizer crisis, due to a spike in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture crop nutrients in many northern states of India. Also, a rise in transportation cost triggered by the recent fuel price hike is putting additional pressure on prices. Rice increased nearly 21% in 2021 amid a rise in demand as the global economy recovery continues. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The CAC 40 Index erased early gains and closed 0.3% down at 7,161.52 on Wednesday, after hitting an intra-day record of 7,201.65 in the session, as surging coronavirus cases amid the spread of the Omicron variant dented traders’ sentiment. France registered over 200 thousand covid cases in the last 24 hours, a new European record. While the government signaled no lockdowns, Health Minister Olivier Veran told lawmakers that hospitals already feel overburdened. On the corporate front, travel and lodging stocks were hit the hardest, driven by Airbus (-1.3%) and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (-1.5%). Still, French equities are on course to finish 2021 on a strong note, pointing to 29% increase on the year, the steepest yearly increase for the CAC 40 since 1999. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biden to speak with Putin on Thursday at Russian leader's request - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)President Joe Biden will hold a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday afternoon "to discuss a range of topics, including upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia," National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne told CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The call was requested by Putin, according to an administration official, and Biden accepted because "he believes when it comes to Russia there is no substitute for direct leader-leader dialogue."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Horne added that "the Biden Administration continues to engage in extensive diplomacy with our European Allies and partners, consulting and coordinating on a common approach in response to Russia's military build-up on the border with Ukraine. President Biden has spoken with leaders across Europe, and Biden Administration officials have engaged multilaterally with (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), the (European Union), and the (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe). They have also held numerous consultations with counterparts, including those from eastern flank countries bilaterally and in the (Bucharest Nine) format as well as Ukraine.", The Bucharest Nine is a reference to nine European nations that form the eastern edge of NATO -- Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Biden plans to preview the upcoming bilateral talks between the US and Russia set to take place on January 10, the official said, and will also discuss the NATO-Russia and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe meetings slated for January 12 and 13. Close consultation with US allies and partners has been "a priority for the administration from the get-go," the official said, and Biden will underscore that to Putin as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , A senior administration official told reporters on Wednesday that while the US and its allies are committed to meaningful diplomacy with Russia, "we are also prepared to respond" with harsh, coordinated sanctions if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The US has also "made plans to reinforce NATO's force posture" in eastern Europe if Russia attacks Ukraine, the official said, and is prepared to provide Ukraine "with further assistance" to help the country defend itself if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The official noted that the US has not yet seen any effort by Russia to lower tensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "We continue to see a significant Russian troop presence in and around the border of Ukraine, and we have continued to make clear to the Russian side that for there to be real progress in these talks, a context of de-escalation will be required."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The US has also developed, "in some detail," a list of concerns it intends to share with Russia "at the appropriate point," the official said. "We are at a moment of crisis and have been for some weeks now, and it will take a high level of engagement to address this and try to find a path of de- escalation."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Biden and Putin are not expected to participate in the talks on January 10 in Geneva, the official said. The talks will include representatives from the Pentagon and NSC and will be led by the State Department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday about the ongoing tensions and previewed Biden's upcoming call with Putin, according to the State Department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Biden-Putin call, scheduled for 3:30 pm ET, will be the second direct contact between the two leaders this month as the US continues to pressure Russia to draw down its large military presence near Ukraine's borders. More than 100,000 Russian troops are still stationed there, and US intelligence officials have warned Ukraine and allies that Russia could be planning to launch an attack as soon as January.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Biden warned Putin during a virtual meeting earlier this month that an invasion would result in serious consequences, such as harsh economic penalties and US military reinforcements on NATO's eastern flank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Putin, in turn, has warned the US and NATO that Russia will be forced to act if its "red lines" are crossed, specifically if NATO expands its military capabilities further eastward and into Ukraine.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russia's consumer price inflation came in at 8.39 percent year-on-year in December 2021, little-changed from the previous month's rate of 8.40 percent, which was the highest since January 2016, a preliminary estimate showed. Inflation has risen sharply this year and is now running at a level that is more than twice the central bank's target of 4 percent, on the back of a rapid economic recovery from the initial phase of the coronavirus, reports of labor shortages across many industries and the ongoing supply issues. Upward pressure came from food (10.62 percent vs 10.81 percent in November), non-food products (8.58 percent vs 8.32 percent), and services (4.98 percent vs 5.15 percent). Policymakers have warned about the threat of an inflationary spiral as consumers bring forward purchases as they fear future price rises, and said food prices should increase further in 2022 due to a weaker-than-expected agricultural season in Russia. </td>

       dropped 0.8% in morning trading Wednesday, reversing earlier intraday gains of as much as 1%, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the social-media and metaverse company looked to divide lawmakers along party lines to forestall any bipartisan attempt to install tougher rules on social-media platforms. Citing people described as familiar with the conversations, the report said Facebook's Washington team called Republican lawmakers to push the narrative that former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen was trying to help Democrats, while at the same time calling Democrats to warn them that Republicans were focused on Facebook's decision to ban expressions of support for Kyle Rittenhouse, who was charged with killing two people during civil unrest in Wisconsin, and later acquitted. The report said Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees not to apologize. Meta's stock has gained 1.2% over the past three months and has rallied 25.8% this year, while the S&amp;P 500

Each of the four major regions witnessed contract transactions decline. Year-on-year, pending home sales were down 2.7%. "There was less pending home sales action this time around, which I would ascribe to low housing supply, but also to buyers being hesitant about home prices. While I expect neither a price reduction, nor another year of record-pace price gains, the market will see more inventory in 2022 and that will help some consumers with affordability", said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Aluminum futures were above $2,800 per tonne in the end of December, slightly below 2008-highs of $3,200 hit in October, but booking a nearly 40% gain for the 2021 year, amid supply chain constraints and lower production. The Chinese industry which accounts for nearly 60% of global aluminum output, was under heavy pressure this year due to severe power shortages, natural disasters and production accidents. In 2021, Chinese smelters have cut a total capacity of 3.8 million mt/year while new capacity only reached 450,000 mt/year, according to Antaike. Also, non-ferrous production in Europe is again under pressure as electricity prices roared back to record levels. Heading into 2022, high power prices, limited supply and rising demand are likely to continue to pressure the aluminum market. At the same time, Chinese authorities asked the aluminum sector to slash emissions 5% by 2025, according to a five-year plan to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and lower energy consumption. </td>

Continuing standoff in the auto sector due to chip shortages and restrictions imposed especially across Europe and top buyer China against the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant heavily weighted on the metal's appeal. Still, increasing demand from China ahead of the Lunar New Year should provide some support at the start of 2022. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Newcastle coal futures were trading slightly above $170 per metric ton in the end of December, well below a record high of $269.50 hit in October, but booking a nearly 110% gain for the 2021 year on strong demand and limited supplies. Higher than normal natural gas prices have been boosting coal appeal in Europe with stockpiles in plants hitting their lowest level since 1970's. Also, demand from India and China remains strong. Earlier this year, China introduced power curbs especially for energy-intensive businesses and restrictions on coal imports, aiming to reach its climate targets but such curbs led to a serious power crunch. The Chinese government then lifted some restrictions to balance the coal market and slow record prices. As a result, global coal power generation is on course to increase by 9% to an all-time high of 10,350 terawatt-hours in 2021, according to the latest IEA report. For 2022, the IEA forecasts both coal production and demand to rise to the highest ever levels. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The UniCredit Bank Austria Manufacturing PMI rebounded to 58.7 in December of 2021 from 58.1 in the previous month. The uptick in factory growth was attributed to a faster increase in output, with a rate of production in line with pre-pandemic standards. December also saw an increase in new orders, driven by a faster rise in new export business and a less manufacturers reporting long delivery times for inputs. On the other hand, supply chain imbalances and higher energy costs drove input price up. In turn, manufacturers marked another rise in purchasing activity to build up inventories and counter shortage possibilities. At the same time, backlogs of work continued to rise, as businesses had difficulty keeping up with demand, partly due to staffing constraints. Hence, employment furthered its steady rise in December. Looking ahead, firms expect a rise in production over the next 12 months, although optimism is at its lowest since August 2020.s </td>

In addition, a shortage of workers in Malaysia and heavier rains than usual in key growing areas hit palm oil production. Prices are expected to remain high during the first quarter of the year as supply tightness persists, amid low seasonal production, the La Nina weather pattern and strong demand for Chinese New Year, before starting to fall in subsequent quarters as output growth accelerates due to improvements in both availability of labor and fertilizer application. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Millions of families are facing a "year of the squeeze" in 2022, a think tank has warned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Resolution Foundation predicts higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises could leave households with a £1,200 a year hit to their incomes.                                                                                                                                                                 , Its report highlights the rise in the energy price cap and National Insurance contributions in April.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The government says it has put £4.2bn in place to support families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , According to the Resolution Foundation, millions of families are facing a "cost-of-living catastrophe" next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , It says a 1.25% increase in National Insurance contributions will cost the average household £600 a year while the higher energy bills cap is expected to add an additional £500 to spending. Both will come into force in April.                                                                                      , The impact of the failure of many firms in the energy sector would see another £100 added to gas and electricity bills. Customers of collapsed energy companies have been shifted to new suppliers but it means they could pay a different - and potentially more expensive - tariff than their previous energy deal.  , In recent months, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. Last week, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about £2,000 next year.                                                                                                      , Earlier this week, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met bosses from the UK's energy companies and the industry's regulator Ofgem "to discuss the ongoing effects of record high global gas prices on the sector".                                                                                                     , Labour has suggested the government immediately remove VAT from household energy bills over winter to help households.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Stephen Fitzpatrick, chief executive of Ovo Energy, who attended the virtual meeting on Monday, also suggested the government should remove "some of the environmental social policy costs that we have seen increase over the years".                                                                                 , Meanwhile, the cost of living in the UK surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November - the highest increase in 10 years - Office for National Statistics data showed.                                                                                                                                                   , Inflation is set to peak at 6% in the spring, according to the Bank of England, and the Resolution Foundation warned that real wage growth, which was flat in October, "almost certainly started falling last month and is unlikely to start growing again until the final quarter of 2022".                           , Resolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell, said: "The overall picture is likely to be one of prices surging and pay packets stagnating."                                                                                                                                                                      , He told the BBC that the UK employment market had shown signs of resilience during the pandemic following the end of the government's furlough scheme on 30 September, with the unemployment rate close to pre-Covid levels at 4.2%.                                                                                   , He also highlighted that the national living wage will rise in April, by 6.6%, which he said means "the lowest earners will be protected from some of these price rises we are seeing".                                                                                                                                , However, Mr Bell said that while some areas of the workforce have seen sharp wage rises - such as in-demand HGV drivers - "overall the story is prices going up for everybody while wages go up for some".                                                                                                             , Mr Bell said Chancellor Rishi Sunak could face increased pressure to take action to alleviate his economic plan set out in the Autumn Budget.                                                                                                                                                                          , The report by the foundation says that poorer families are going to be the worse hit by the "year of the squeeze", as they spend a higher proportion of their income on energy.                                                                                                                                        , A government spokesman said its help included reducing the Universal Credit taper, as well as measures to assist with bills, including cold weather payments and a freeze in alcohol and fuel duty.                                                                                                                    , The lads are on a Christmas quest to catch an elusive English salmon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Who is the strange cloaked figure in The Mezzotint?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , © 2021 BBC.

At a normal (and stable) rate of climb, we should be +64% off of the March 2020 low.  Instead, we&amp;#39;re at +119%.  We should be trading around 360 right now.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to sources, Biden is just kicking himself after looking at his to-do list for 2021 and realizing he forgot to shut down the virus. 

&amp;quot;Ah, dadgummit!&amp;quot; Biden exclaimed to a nearby potted plant while slapping his forehead. &amp;quot;I knew I was forgetting something! That&amp;#39;s too bad because it was otherwise a flawless year for me!&amp;quot; 

Health experts say COVID deaths surged all through 2021 and cases are currently skyrocketing because Biden misplaced his small spiral-bound notebook where he keeps track of all the items on his to-do list. &amp;quot;We all forget—It happens to the best of us,&amp;quot; said Dr. Fauci. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;ll put this item at the top of his list for next year.&amp;quot;

White House insiders say that instead Biden decided there is no federal government solution to the virus and happily crossed the item off his list in time for the new year.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Everyone quit worrying whether it will go up or down. VIX is getting near the floor again - time to load up your options! Get some deep ITM calls to the next expiry - you can get the equivalent to 100 spy shares for about $1500 right now for Friday expiry. Hedge with two 25 delta puts for a 30 day expiry - maintain that 2 to 1 delta ratio and constantly roll. If VIX drops below 15 hedge with three 17 to 18 delta puts - again 30 days out on those. This is the Vega (volatility) bomb.

Roll puts and calls constantly! If puts go up a few handles, just cash in and buy whatever higher strike you need to maintain the 95 plus delta. This is why calls are far superior to shares with VIX low like this - you can take profit and not lose delta!

Always maintain exposure! </td>

Few people realize the very essence of (the study of) economics. 
 
&amp;quot;Econo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;omia&amp;quot; is from the Greek, loosely meaning &amp;quot;household [financial] management&amp;quot;.    In other words, budgeting wants and needs, in an environment restrained by finite resources. 
 
Well, fast forward to the glorified p(l)andemic, and the nothing of finite resources is completely gone.  4,000 million / day of new money, every day, for 2 years continuously. 
 
Let&amp;#39;s just say, if the US was a household, it wouldn&amp;#39;t last another hour.  And a true pity that economics (as it as known pre-mid 2010s) is dead.  buried.  eviscerated.   
 
Better off studying theology to figure out the markets henceforth. </td>

Sure, speculative tech and biotech got crushed this year, but that happens.  You shouldn&amp;#39;t be in those sectors if you aren&amp;#39;t surprised by years like 2021.  Bio, especially, seems primed for a glorious 2022.  At least three of my top five picks for 2022 will be smid bios.   Deal with it, don&amp;#39;t whine about it.  My largest position is SPY.

Last year, nobody dreamed the Fed would raise rates until 2023. Now market makers need to factor in the possibility of at least three rate hikes, which will degrade the future earnings of growth stocks. 

Personally, I don’t think the Fed will be as aggressive as everybody fears, but this is not enough to give market makers the warm and fuzzy to continue aping into tech, growth, and other conceptual companies. 

I expect these companies to remain under pressure for quite some time. The travel sector is about as much risk as I am willing to take because I think the grand reopening narrative will return in about a month or so.

I might consider megacap tech once the valuations come down a bit. Other than that, I think value is the safest place to put money to work to actually make money. Won’t be anything like 2020 or 2021, but the environment has changed and we need to adapt accordingly. 

The same ole plays aren’t going to work under these market conditions. </td>

1. More money is being invested by all types of people (young and old) and globally more and more each year which is more demand for stocks. Do Bears see money exiting the market anytime soon and why?
2. Large Cap companies are the ones that are bringing in increased revenues driving value…do you honestly see sell offs in the Large Caps anytime soon?
3. Covid…in covid culture more and more money going into Tech, Amazon, most all SP500 top companies. Little guy getting kicked to curb. See this changing?
More money going to SP500 and QQQ or out of it this next year?
4. Pay rates and minimum wages going up due to covid so more money going into 401k and savings funds
5. Inflation…company estimates were lowered last quarter but everyone paid way higher prices for the same shit so revenues and sales figures will be thru the roof. Inflation always transitions to the buyer. </td>

$1k - $1m challenge update as usual 🚀

Initial: $1,000
Current: $12,046
Goal: $1,000,000 by March 1
- 1 trade per day 

Today was another really fun volatility day, and there were numerous opportunities for quick and easy scalps, especially on a 0dte day. The options challenge trade was a nice and easy 24% scalp today, overachieving the 15% daily goal.

(People really don’t know that 15% a day can make you over $1m in one month and they just hate because they can’t do it themselves 🤷‍♂️) 

Posted the graph of the challenge so far below as well!

Keep giving us volatility into the new year!

It takes time until policymakers pick up on these developments and write policies around these ideas but certainly as the public become more educated we will see major changes in AI policies that will be developed around these research.

WEDNESDAY, DEC 29, 2021 - 01:45 PM
After months of providing valuable Covid-19 information that runs counter to the official narrative, Twitter has finally banned Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA technology.

Malone, who will appear on the Joe Rogan show Thursday according to associate Ed Dowd (one of four contributors to the Malone doctrine), had more than 520,000 followers. He has been an outspoken critic of both mRNA vaccines, as well as the abysmal failures of policymakers worldwide in responding to the pandemic.

 
He was not warned or provided an opportunity to delete any offending tweets - instead he was &amp;quot;just suspended,&amp;quot; Dowd continued. </td>

Who knew that oxygen was still needed to live in these tough times?  Don&amp;#39;t worry, the level of denial and ridicule for others is still alive and well on FOX News. They can&amp;#39;t help themselves. 

Will their overburdened Hospital Staff move them into the Waiting Room and say...

&amp;quot;You will need to wait for a room to open up as we are full and since you are not vaccinated, take a number...Oh well. &amp;quot;

Stay safe all.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The simple fact is that it&amp;#39;s very hard to make money being bearish. You get very few opportunities to actually make money in the market. 

Meanwhile, the easy money is made on the long side.

The market has been in an uptrend for yearssss. Very few down moves, and when they come, they are very quick.  

The market spends the vast majority of its time heading higher. That&amp;#39;s just a fact. You cannot argue that. And if you do, it&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s something wrong with how you&amp;#39;re viewing the market. 

If you disagree, then maybe you&amp;#39;ve been looking at your charts upside down ;)

Weak longs stopped, knee jerk shorts enter, probably retreated and flipped long on the strong bounce. Now we have weaker longs, unhappy shorts underwater or at a loss and price flatline. No short termers happy here. And reactive. Not looking for any move to have follow thru. More likely a game of stop out one side then the other over and over until we resolved and that is likely to the downside at least temporarily. A 1-2 day squeeze to new highs before that is possible too. Building power for amove down. Seeing $176 again soon. A gap up tomorrow and run up to $186 would be epic. 😂 Wow this is so incredibly boring. </td>

Short term might see small pump in markets but gonna be a bear market until 1st rate increase and certainly after Q4 results in JANUARY. Tesla will be pumped even if Elon farts 😂 .

FEB :
SPY 430 ish Tesla if there is no Split $900 FB $270  Apple 140+

NO JPOW papa involvement is good for the country. We are about to see how real markets will behave by 2022 summer. This bubble needs correction. Gonna buy puts at the close for FEB and forget about it and as well as DT. </td>

Here is a screen shot:   Pull up the page, then select and Clink on  &amp;quot;Ownership Disclosures&amp;quot;  (see pic)  it pulls up the latest SEC filings.

Elon seems to be about done selling and the stock&amp;#39;s had a pretty decent rebound the past week with the MACD crossing. Hit some resistance on the trendline drawn though. Risky to go long up here imo until that trendline breaks. Over 1120 its upside targets are 1175, 1200, then ath around 1250+. On the weekly chart it looks like it&amp;#39;s in a bull flag that should send it up to 1500 area once it breaks out over the ath, but as it needs to break that resistance line first or it could consolidate for a long time like it did for the first 8 months of 2021 </td>

If Democrats want to save Build Back Better, it must be paid for in full

Much of the attention since Manchin&amp;#39;s announcement has focused on what&amp;#39;s in and what&amp;#39;s out. Those decisions will be difficult, but regardless of the specific policy compromises that will be necessary to get the bill over the finish line, Manchin laid down one overall marker that should serve as the guiding principle for rebuilding the BBBA: ensure that its provisions are fully and transparently funded over the long-term. 

That is not the case with the version that passed in the House. In an effort to enact as many new or expanded programs as possible while keeping the official 10-year cost to about $2 trillion without increasing 10-year budget deficits, House Democrats chose to simply end (sunset) several key provisions after a few years while offsetting them with permanent revenue increases.

I covered my short $ccl at a loss Tuesday, no matter on that trade, made a lot of money on recent short CCL trades, unbelievable CCL has not sold of hard, what a scam it came sonclose to 19s only to rally higher.

I just want to get this out of my chest as we exit 2021 knowing that Tesla is a mega cap S&amp;amp;P 500 included security with all privileges being held by top Funds &amp;amp; Passive ones “at maintain” specified percentage determined by the “Index” and supervised by the “Committee” during a process called balancing every Q ! 

As we wrap up Q4 tomorrow- last trading day, I can say for certain based on my own calculations, these funds are massively underweight Tesla and NOT in compliance !! 

I challenge the committee to enforce the rules set by the index as I challenge SEC to enforce the rules set by the DOJ I also challenge all our representatives who were elected by the very  Democratic process that gives them the power for balance and justice to enforce or the entire system is deemed dead and time for “Direct Democracy” with no special interests bought representatives !!

But this week though markets are continuing in the up trend and hitting again record highs. Volume has been low across the major indices with a lot of fluff rolling volume, IE just not real action, resulting in what we are seeing in these flat trends and stalled options action. Todays economical reports did not come in all that well, but had been disregarded for the most part, as though they missed the said to be experts expectation. They pretty much came as most of the smart money had predicted they would. IE they where as expected aside from the housing report which was worse then expected all around. </td>

How can it be? Nobody knows, but this is how option mafia does it&amp;#39;s business. They sold overpriced OTM weeklies. They burn it to zero. And only after that they let the stonk run.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA Today didn’t go as planned but there were some small wins if you played it right. Let’s see how the rest of the week plays out. 

The recovery we had from $1064 low back to 61.8% Fib was impressive because we could have easily went down to $1020 there. 

The daily to me still shows a short term gap up to $1130 and an inverted H&amp;amp;S if you take in account why the sell off started. The right side of the daily is flagging just needs to break that $1120 resistance. 

I’m still swinging my $1150 calls full into Thursday. </td>

$1k - $1m challenge update as usual 🚀

Initial: $1,000
Current: $12,046
Goal: $1,000,000 by March 1
- 1 trade per day 

Today was another really fun volatility day, and there were numerous opportunities for quick and easy scalps, especially on a 0dte day. The options challenge trade was a nice and easy 24% scalp today, overachieving the 15% daily goal.

(People really don’t know that 15% a day can make you over $1m in one month and they just hate because they can’t do it themselves 🤷‍♂️) 

Posted the graph of the challenge so far below as well!

Keep giving us volatility into the new year!
