   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Futures Flat After Nasdaq-Led Rebound </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures held steady on Wednesday after a broad market rebound in the previous session, as investors bought the dip following days of sharp losses. Dow futures were little changed, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were also flat. During regular trading on Tuesday, the Nasdaq led the market higher after climbing 1.41%, followed by the S&amp;P’s 0.92% gain, snapping a 5-day slide, and the Dow’s 0.51% rise. The energy, basic materials, consumer cyclical, technology and communication services sectors were the top performers. The moves came as markets at least temporarily found relief in assurances from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that the central bank would step in as necessary to rein in inflation. Analysts also suggested that the anxiety relating to the Fed’s hawkish tilt and the outlook for higher rates seemed to have calmed a bit for now. Meanwhile, investors await Wednesday’s key inflation data to guide the economic and policy outlook. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> How the soaring cost of living is hitting Sri Lankans hard </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> "Cooking gas cylinder prices have almost doubled and we cannot afford it anymore," says Niluka Dilrukshi. The 31 year-old mother-of-four has always cooked with gas to prepare food for her family, but now says firewood is her only option.                                                                                                , "I used to provide fish and vegetables daily to my children. Now we are giving them one vegetable with rice," she says. "Earlier we used to have three meals a day, now sometimes we can afford only two."                                                                                                                                   , Mrs Dilrukshi and her family live in a suburb of Colombo, in Sri Lanka. Her husband is a day-wage labourer but the soaring cost of essential items, particularly food, means they are suddenly struggling to make ends meet.                                                                                                                 , Over the past four months, the price of a standard cooking gas cylinder has shot up from $7.50 to $13.25 - an increase of around 85%.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Sri Lanka, an island nation of 22 million people, is facing an unprecedented economic crisis. Its foreign exchange reserves dropped to around $1.6bn by the end of November, only enough to pay for just a few weeks of imports.                                                                                                             , As a result, the government has been forced to restrict the import of several essential commodities - including food items - in a desperate bid to hang on to its vital dollar reserves. This move, combined with increasing fuel and freight costs, has pushed the price of essentials such as milk powder and rice much higher.            , This sharp rise in living costs is not just a problem for Sri Lanka. Several other nations in Asia, such as neighbouring India and Pakistan are also battling soaring inflation -  people across the continent are having to tighten their belts to cover the cost of every day food and energy costs.                                       , The situation is particularly acute in Sri Lanka, because it is a smaller island nation that's very reliant on overseas imports to feed its population. For example, the country's tiny dairy industry cannot meet local demand so it imports powdered milk.                                                                                 , But in the bustling main vegetable market in Colombo dozens of shop owners are selling plentiful supplies of carrot, beetroot, curry leaves and many other greens. Many shoppers openly complain about the surging prices and are bargaining hard to reduce the price, or buying very limited quantities.                                    , "With our current monthly salary, we can survive only for two weeks because the prices have shot up. We don't have any hope for the future. Rice prices have also increased. There's a long queue outside government-run shops," one of the shoppers, Ms Swarna explains.                                                                    , With several essential food items in high demand, Sri Lanka's food prices increased by a record 21.1% last month on a year-on-year basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Following a sharp hike in milk powder prices - up 12.5% - the café owners' association has decided to suspend selling popular staple, milk tea, entirely. They say milk tea will only be offered on demand, at a higher price.                                                                                                               , "Sri Lankans are quite sensitive to food price inflation. There has been already a lot of negative sentiment regarding the constraints that we are seeing," says Deshal de Mel, an economist with think tank Verité Research. "I think it is probably close to a point of a lack of tolerance if this level of price escalation [continues].", Just before the New Year, the government managed to increase the reserves to $3.1bn reportedly through currency swap arrangements.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But Sri Lanka's total external debts are estimated to be more than $45bn and it needs to find more than $6bn this year for debt servicing. It's not the only nation in this position, Pakistan and the Maldives are also thought to be suffering.                                                                                            , The pandemic and the rising global fuel costs have added to Sri Lanka's woes. The country's biggest revenue earner, tourism, has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic with international flights grounded.                                                                                                                                   , Sri Lanka earned nearly $4bn from tourism in 2019 - and that has dropped by around 90% due to the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The government says its options are limited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "We had to go into a restriction of imports because the pressure on our current account, as well on our trade deficit, was increasing due to the pandemic situation. But as a responsible government we need to manage it," Shehan Semasinghe, a Sri Lankan minister tells the BBC.                                                          , The opposition has party meanwhile has held protests over rising living costs. "This has been building up for a long time. We have been living beyond our means. We have been absorbing more than we have been producing," says Harsha De Silva, an opposition MP and a former minister of economic reforms.                                 , To calm growing public anger over rising costs, the government recently announced a $1bn relief package - including a pay and pension hike for government employees. It also lifted tax on some food and medicine and simultaneously announced income support for its poorest citizens.                                                      , This is set against a backdrop of high global oil prices, the average cost of shipping a standard container from Europe to Asia has increased from around $2,000 in 2020, to over $10,000 last year.                                                                                                                                         , The UN agency, Unctad, recently warned that the recovery of the global economy is threatened by high freight rates. It forecasts that small island nations like Sri Lanka - which are dependent on deliveries by sea - are likely to be hard hit by a spike in import prices.                                                                , The rising fuel and energy prices have a had a cascading effect on wholesale prices with transporters increasing charges. In neighbouring India, the annual wholesale price-based inflation reached an all-time high of 14.2% last November.                                                                                                 , And in Pakistan, consumer price inflation rose to 12.3% in December, the highest in nearly two years - the hike in food prices and other essentials being blamed on rising fuel costs.                                                                                                                                                       , Recent Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) data show global food price index in 2021 averaged 28% higher than the previous year.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "The high cost of inputs, ongoing global pandemic and ever more uncertain climatic conditions leave little room for optimism about a return to more stable market conditions, even in 2022," says FAO senior economist Abdolreza Abbassian.                                                                                                  , Meanwhile, back in Colombo, people like Mrs Dilrukshi, now living on the breadline, are worried that if local prices rise just a little bit further, it will be difficult to keep the firewood burning in their kitchens at all.                                                                                                             , Death in Paradise returns with a brand new series!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The Tourist: A tense new thriller starring Jamie Dornan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Soaring energy prices which threaten the living standards of millions could last up to two years, the boss of the UK's biggest energy supplier has said.                                                                                                         , Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, said there was "no reason" to expect gas prices would come down "anytime soon".                                                                                                                     , He said hopes that bills rising by more than 50% to about £2,000 a year would be short lived may be misplaced.                                                                                                                                                   , Rising energy bills have fuelled concerns over the cost of living.                                                                                                                                                                                               , "The market suggests the high gas prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years," Mr O'Shea told the BBC.                                                                                                                                              , Many countries see gas as an intermediate solution while they wean themselves off more carbon-intensive energy sources, such as oil and coal, creating an international dash for gas as the world economy wakes up after its Covid-related slumber.              , "As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel," Mr O'Shea said.                                                                                                                                                                                     , "And so as you turn off coal fired power stations in other countries, there isn't an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly."                                                                                                                        , The idea of re-badging gas as a "transitional fuel", rather than as a traditional hydrocarbon, has growing political support and has encouraged those calling for increased investment in boosting the supply of gas from domestic sources such as the North Sea., However, Mr O'Shea was doubtful that higher levels of UK-sourced gas would have made much difference to surging prices.                                                                                                                                          , "I'm not sure an increase in UK supply would have brought the price down from £3 a therm, as it was in December, from 50p as it was a year ago," he said.                                                                                                        , "We bring gas in from the United States, from Norway, from Europe, from Qatar, from other places. So we're not in a position to simply have the UK as an isolated energy market. We are part of a global market."                                                , Mr O'Shea suggested three moves the government could make to help households cope with what has been described as a "cost of living crisis".                                                                                                                     , "Those three things together, could be enacted very quickly, without regret," he said. "And that would take care of half of the price rise. And then you could get a further relief targeted to those households that needed most."                              , Government officials have discussed targeting relief through changes to the warm homes discount plan, which currently offers a one off payment of £140 to those in receipt of certain benefits.                                                                  , Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has proposed increasing that payment to £300 and widening the number of people eligible.                                                                                                                          , Mr O'Shea said the current design of the scheme would see relief for some result in rises in everyone else's bills.                                                                                                                                              , "The way the warm homes discount works is that the cost of that scheme is met by customers. So if you increase it, you increase energy bills and we think that whatever relief comes is got to not be at the expense of hard-pressed energy consumers," he added., Another option proposed by some in the energy industry is to find a way to provide support to energy companies via loans or a fund, which firms could borrow from when wholesale prices are high and pay back once they've fallen.                               , But according to Mr O'Shea, that plan would rely on the assumption that prices would fall which he said might be wishful thinking.                                                                                                                               , "Ultimately, everybody in the UK is a taxpayer and an energy consumer. So the cost of this is going to have to be paid by UK citizens," he added. "The question as to whether that's paid for the energy bill, or for general taxation is one for government."   , The government has indicated it will decide on what support it will offer before the new energy price cap, which is the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, is set on 7 February.                                                            , Death in Paradise returns with a brand new series!                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The Tourist: A tense new thriller starring Jamie Dornan                                                                                                                                                                                                          , © 2022 BBC.

But it will no longer have branches there to serve individual account holders or small- or middle-market businesses. And it will no longer be bound up with an operation that has generated heavy regulatory scrutiny.               , “We’ll be able to direct our resources to opportunities aligned with our core strengths and competitive advantages,” Citi’s chief executive, Jane Fraser, said in a statement emailed to journalists. “We will further simplify our bank.”                                                                                                                                                                    , In 2014, Banamex revealed that one of its most important clients, a Mexican oil services firm, had defrauded the bank of $400 million and that, in a separate matter, bodyguards working for bank employees were taking kickbacks from some of the bank’s vendors.                                                                                                                                            , In 2015, federal banking regulators and California fined a related, U.S.-based Citi subsidiary, Banamex USA, $140 million for failing to have adequate anti-money-laundering controls in place, conditions that regulators learned of while trying to follow the flow of drug money. Citi later shut down the U.S. business and paid $97.4 million to settle a federal criminal investigation into the matter., Citi has also said it will exit its consumer businesses in Asia and Europe, part of a plan to “focus on wealth centers globally,” according to its announcement on Tuesday. Citi earned $1.2 billion from its Mexican consumer business during the first three quarters of 2021. The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Friday.                                                            , Advertisement </td>

        +2.40%
       said late Tuesday it has agreed to buy mortgage lender Bay Equity Home Loans for $135 million in cash and stock. The San Francisco Bay Area lender is licensed in 42 states and employs about 1,200 people, Redfin said. "The acquisition accelerates Redfin's strategy to become a one-stop shop for brokerage, lending and other services," the company said. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, pending customary approvals, and to be "accretive" to Redfin's per-share earnings this year, Redfin said. Bay Equity would continue to operate under its name and originate mortgages for customers working with Redfin agents and others, Redfin said. As part of the deal, Redfin plans to eliminate 121 Redfin Mortgage jobs, which the company said represented less than 2% of its total number of employees. Workers affected have been notified and could choose other roles within the company, Redfin said. Shares of Redfin were flat in the extended session after ending the regular trading day up 2.4%. , The number of Americans in hospitals with COVID-19 exceeded the peak seen last winter over the weekend, highlighting the speed with which the highly transmissible omicron variant is spreading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biogen Inc. 
        BIIB,
        +2.64%
       shares fell more than 6% in the extended session Tuesday after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Medicare program, said it plans to cover the biotech's controversial Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm and future others like it only in certain instances. CMS's proposal is that Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibodies such as Aduhelm and others in its class would be covered for people with Medicare only if they are enrolled in "qualifying clinical trials," the agency said. The proposed determination is open to public comment for 30 days. If the proposal is finalized, CMS will review each clinical trial submitted to decide whether it meets its criteria. Medicare patients participating in these trials would be eligible to receive coverage of the drug, related services, and other routine costs, CMS said. Aduhelm, the first new treatment for Alzheimer's in 20 years, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of the neurodegenerative disease in June but its sales have disappointed investors and have been a small portion of what Biogen expected.  , Inflationary pressures are expected to last well into the middle of this year, but the Fed is prepared to act if they last longer than expected, Chair Jerome Powell said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

The union, which represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines and is seeking to unionize Delta’s flight attendants, responded on Tuesday that its statements had been “truthful and accurate.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Delta has always followed the science to form our policies regarding Covid-19,” the airline said in a statement on Tuesday. “We sent a cease and desist letter because we believe institutions and leaders must speak carefully, truthfully and factually.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The union’s president, Sara Nelson, said Delta was responsible for confusing workers. “We’re glad that A.F.A.’s calling attention to the issues appears to have led Delta to update its policy several times and communicate this to workers,” Ms. Nelson said in her letter, which was addressed to Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The dispute concerns Delta’s adherence to a recent change by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has shortened the recommended isolation time to five days for people who are vaccinated and who get the virus, so long as their symptoms are resolving and they have no fever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The C.D.C.’s updated guidance was released after Delta executives sent the agency a letter arguing that the previous 10-day isolation period “may significantly impact our work force and operations.” Some public health experts had also called for updated guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Airlines canceled tens of thousands of flights over the holidays in response to bad weather and because thousands of employees called in sick. In a single day, nearly a third of United Airlines employees at Newark Liberty International Airport reported being unable to work. About 3,000 United employees have recently tested positive for the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , After the C.D.C. changed its guidance, Delta quickly adjusted its own policies, slashing the Covid-specific paid sick leave to five days for workers who are fully vaccinated, with two additional paid days if they choose to be tested on Day 5 and the results are positive. In accordance with C.D.C. guidelines, it does not require a negative Covid test to return to work. The C.D.C.’s decision not to recommend a test after five days of isolation has been criticized by some scientists. Delta, which said that over 95 percent of its work force is vaccinated, said employees may return to work only if they had no symptoms and must wear a mask in all settings through the 10th day after testing positive., Ms. Nelson has claimed that the union is “still getting questions from Delta flight attendants about returning to work with a low-grade fever.” She also said the union was hearing concerns about the availability of tests and confusion over guaranteed pay and the quality of masks required for those returning to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Ms. Nelson criticized the changes, warning airlines that they could put passengers and airline employees at risk. Delta’s pilots union has expressed similar concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Unfortunately, changing C.D.C. and company guidance, compounded by limited testing availability, has led to confusion among employees who may be returning to work sooner than they should or are comfortable doing so,” the pilots union, the Delta Master Executive Council, said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Most flight attendants at large airlines are represented by unions, and Ms. Nelson’s organization has been trying to organize Delta for several years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In his letter to the union, Delta’s chief legal officer, Peter Carter, defended the airline’s policies, saying Delta has been “laser focused on keeping its employees safe and providing them the necessary time off when they are too ill to work” during the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> API data reportedly show a nearly 11 million-barrel weekly rise in U.S. gasoline supplies - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a decline in weekly U.S. crude supplies, but inventories of gasoline climbed sharply, according to sources. The API reportedly said domestic crude supplies fell by 1.1 million barrels for the week ended Jan. 7, while gasoline stockpiles saw a weekly increase of 10.9 million barrels and distillate supplies rose by about 3 million barrels. Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday. On average, the EIA is expected to show crude inventories down by 1.6 million barrels, according to a survey of analysts conducted by S&amp;P Global Platts. The survey also calls for weekly supply increases of 3 million barrels for gasoline and 2 million barrels for distillates. Oil prices held onto the day's gains in the electronic trading session, after the API data. February West Texas Intermediate crude

Ossoff's blind trust contributed to a net worth somewhere between $2 million and $7.3 million as of late 2020.  </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed Chair Powell says rate hikes, tighter policy will be needed to control inflation </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, with a seemingly clear path to a second term heading the central bank, declared Tuesday that the U.S. economy is both healthy enough and in need of tighter monetary policy.                                                                                                                                                                                               , As part of his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Powell said he expects a series of interest rate hikes this year, along with other reductions in the extraordinary help the Fed has been providing during the pandemic era.                                                                                                                            , "As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we'll be normalizing policy, meaning we're going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we'll be raising rates over the course of the year," he told committee members. "At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that's just the road to normalizing policy."                          , He made the remarks during a 2½-hour session that included both praise for the Fed's handling of the economy and criticism over perceived ethical lapses from central bank officials. Some Republican senators also expressed worries over whether the Fed was veering too far from its stated objectives of price stability, full employment and banking oversight.                                               , Ultimately, though, Powell appeared headed toward a successful confirmation from the full Senate. Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick Toomey, the ranking Republican, both said they plan on supporting President Joe Biden's nomination. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has said she will oppose the nomination, after calling Powell "dangerous" during a hearing last year., Many of the questions from both sides of the aisle centered on inflation, which is running at a close to 40-year high. After declaring the surge "transitory" for much of 2021, the Fed has pivoted on inflation and is expected to raise rates three or four times this year in quarter percentage-point increments.                                                                                              , Higher interest rates control inflation by slowing down the flow of money, which has been running rapidly through the economy as the Fed and Congress have combined to provide more than $10 trillion worth of stimulus.                                                                                                                                                                                           , "If we see inflation persisting at high levels longer than expected, then if we have to raise interest more over time, we will," Powell said. "We will use our tools to get inflation back."                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In addition to rate hikes, the Fed also is tapering its monthly bond purchases, which have added more than $4.5 trillion to its balance sheet since the early days of the pandemic. Officials also have indicated they will start decreasing the balance sheet later this year, mostly likely by allowing a set level of proceeds to run off each month, though the Fed also could sell assets outright.           , Powell said the moves are in response to an economy that has both a strong jobs picture, with an unemployment rate at 3.9% in December, but with inflation expected to top 7% year over year for the same period.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "What that's really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we've had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath," Powell said. "We're really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it's a long road to normal from where we are."                                                  , He faced some questioning about why the Fed got its inflation call wrong, and he again cited issues mostly related to the pandemic, which has seen clogged supply chains, sparsely stocked store shelves and rising prices that Powell said could threaten the recovery.                                                                                                                                           , "If inflation does become persistent, if these high levels of inflation get entrenched in our economy and people's thinking, then inevitably that will lead to much higher monetary policy from this," he said. "That could lead to a recession and that will be bad for workers."                                                                                                                                 , Powell also faced questions about a controversy in recent months over the financial activities of several officials around the time the Fed was about to implement a series of rescue measures just before the pandemic declaration.                                                                                                                                                                               , Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida announced Monday that he is resigning a few weeks ahead of the end of his term following additional disclosures about his buying and selling of equity funds. Regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas resigned in 2021 following similar disclosures.                                                                                       , Powell said the Fed soon would be publishing rules that would prohibit similar activities without 45 days' notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The old system was in place for decades and then suddenly it was revealed insufficient," he said of the prior rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures settled higher for a third straight session on Tuesday. Comments from the Federal Reserve's Jerome Powell at his confirmation hearing for a second four-year term as chairman did little to sway expectations for higher inflation and volatility in financial markets. Powell said the central bank's plans to raise interest rates should not throw a wrench in the economy or damage the job market, essentially painting a picture of a "soft landing" rather than a recession. "As spooked as all the markets have been by the Fed's shift to more-hawkish rhetoric, I think Powell's testimony served as reassurance that the central bank won't move too drastically and will keep the health of the economy as its foremost priority," Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter, told MarketWatch.

Gooslbee told Neil Cavuto it could be a "blockbuster year" for the economy if those factors align.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , CONGRESS EXPLORING MORE COVID RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS OMICRON SURGES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: If we cannot get control of the virus, that will affect the economic growth, and it will slow down. If we can get control of virus, if omicron ends up being mild, and by mid-February we're past this thing, then I think Jamie Diamond's right, we're going to be off to the races. The job market is very strong. The growth rate... was looking very strong, and we'll have to see if Chair Powell is correct that the supply chain pressures are going to ease. Hopefully, that happens. In which case, it could be a blockbuster year... They would need to raise rates and get back to normal. But if we cannot do that, and if the growth rate does not end up being four five six percent, but falls back to two or even slows down, sort of like at the tail end of the Trump administration when the first... resurgence of the virus happened, the job numbers actually went negative. The GDP growth rate slowed, and we could be back into that. So we're just going to have to monitor., GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , WATCH THE FULL VIDEO BELOW:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Economics professor Austan Goolsbee joined 'Cavuto: Coast to Coast' to discuss what factors will need to align in order for the nation to experience solid economic growth in 2022. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> EIA expects U.S. oil production to reach a record in 2023 - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Energy Information Administration on Tuesday said it expects annual U.S. oil production to reach a record next year. The government agency pegged average production at 11.2 million barrels per day in 2021, and sees a rise to 11.8 million barrels per day this year, with output then rising to 12.4 million barrels per day in 2023 - the highest annual average on record, according to the monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook report. "We expect global demand for petroleum products to return to and surpass pre-pandemic levels this year, but crude-oil production grows at a faster rate in our forecasts," said EIA Acting Administrator Steve Nalley, in a statement. "We expect that as crude oil production increases, inventories will begin to replenish and help push prices lower for gasoline, jet fuel, and other products in the short term." The EIA also lifted its 2022 forecast for West Texas Intermediate crude prices to $71.32 a barrel, up 7.4% from the December forecast. In Tuesday dealings, February WTI crude oil

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cocoa futures rose above $2500 a tonne in the second week of January, recovering from an over two-week low of $2423 touched on January 6th amid firm demand and tight supplies. Data showed the cocoa grind in top producer Ivory Coast rose almost 2% year-on-year in December to 52,000 tonnes whereas on the supply side, cocoa arrivals at ports in Ivory Coast fell 6.4% year-on-year during October to January 9th period.Traders also expect improved demand conditions in fourth-quarter grinding data of Europe, Asia and the U.S., due next week. Meanwhile, light rains and mild seasonal winds in most of Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions raised outlooks for both October-to-March and April-to-September crops. Elsewhere, the International Cocoa Organization in its recent report projected that global demand for cocoa would go up by 4.9 million tonnes in the 2021/2022 cropping season whereas production would rise by 5.2 million tonnes due to better weather conditions in major producing countries. </td>

Fed’s chairman said that there will be a long road to normal and that the balance sheet should runoff later this year, while the impacts of the covid-19 on the labor market may be short-lived. Still, inflation worries remain and Fed will keep adopting the necessary measures to tame the sharp increase in prices. Oil prices – a major Mexican export – rebounded sharply to above $81 per barrel. Still, domestically, the rapid spread of Covid-19 cases dent the sentiment after the country keeps recording record-high daily cases, while President Lopez Obrador has announced that he had contracted Covid for a 2nd time. </td>

Powell has since acknowledged that inflation has been higher and longer-lasting than the Fed anticipated, and has charted out a more hawkish path for the central bank to pull back its support for the economy. , Sen. Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, argued the Fed should have started winding down its massive bond-buying program sooner, suggesting the central bank's purchase of $120 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds helped fuel inflation.                                                                                      , "We’re more than a year into record economic expansion, with unemployment at near all-time lows, and yet the Fed is still buying government and agency securities," Toomey said.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Sen.

The Labor Department last month said that inflation soared 6.8% in November from the same month a year earlier, the fastest pace since June 1982.                                                                                                             , "None of the Fed’s pandemic actions came without a cost," Toomey said. "This negative-real interest rate environment continues to distort markets, risk asset bubbles and punish savers. And the Fed has dramatically expanded its balance sheet with trillions in government bonds, effectively monetizing a lot of debt, facilitating profligate government spending."                 , The Fed began tapering its bond purchases in November by $15 billion a month, and announced during its December meeting that it would double that to $30 billion beginning in January. Under that timeframe, the central bank is poised to conclude the program by March, allowing Fed officials to begin hiking interest rates and reducing the $8.8 trillion balance sheet.            , AMERICANS' INFLATION FEARS STAYED AT RECORD HIGH IN DECEMBER: NY FED SURVEY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Powell said he expects inflation to subside by the middle of the year, but that the Fed needs to take whatever actions are needed to prevent higher prices from becoming "entrenched." Minutes released from the central bank's December meeting show that officials are prepared to raise rates "sooner and faster" than initially expected in order to combat the inflation surge.     , "We are going to have to be humble but a bit nimble," he told lawmakers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Billboard on the cruelties of inflation in Coon Rapids, Minnesota.

Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumers and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing them to cut back on spending.                             , Sen. Sherrod Brown, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, urged the Fed to not prematurely end its support for the economy and suggested that corporations and supply chain shocks are the real driving force behind inflation. He pressed Powell to put workers first.                                                                                                          , "Some are suggesting though that the Fed pull back on its support of the broader economy, and make it harder for people to get jobs," Brown, D-Ohio, said. "When people talk about ‘cooling off’ the economy, what they really mean is making it harder for people to find jobs and stopping paychecks from growing."                                                                    , Brown also asked Powell whether he intends to make climate risk stress tests for banks a priority during his second term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "It’s very likely stress scenarios, as we like to call them, will be a key tool going forward," Powell said. "Climate stress scenarios at this stage are really about ensuring that the large financial institutions understand all the risks that they're taking, including the risks that may be inherent in their business model regarding climate change."                           , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But Toomey, who has been an outspoken critic over what he considers to be a politicization of the top bank, warned there would be consequences if the Fed ventured beyond its Congress-given mandate of stabilizing prices and ensuring maximum employment.                                                                                                                              , "Let me be clear," he said, "if this politicization continues unchecked, it will not end well for the Fed or for independently driven monetary policy."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Despite the misgivings they expressed, both Brown and Toomey have said they will support Powell for a second term. Powell is expected to glide through the confirmation process with enough bipartisan support, even though some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. – have said they will not back him. </td>

I think that is similarly true with respect to the supply chain disruptions," the chamber's chief policy officer Neil Bradley told reporters at a press conference. "We didn't have a sudden surge in concentration in our supply chains that somehow produced the bottlenecks.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The dollar index weakened to below  95.7 on Tuesday after Powell remarks before the Senate dashed markets' expectations for a more hawkish approach. Fed’s chairman said that there will be a long road to normal and the impacts of the covid-19 on the labor market may be short-lived. Also, Fed officials have dropped hints they may start shrinking their asset portfolio soon after they raise rates, with the Powell saying such a process could begin “perhaps later this year.” At the same time, Fed reassured that the rates can be raised more if needed. Meanwhile, the US core CPI is expected to have risen by 5.4% in December, its highest in decades, and up from 4.9% in the previous month. </td>

Get them out. Stop paying people not to work. Get the government out of the process and that thing will clear up very quickly. That's exactly what needs to be done. It's the government that is causing the supply chain problem. It's not the solution, it's the cause. And the same thing with rapid testing and all the other things. The one thing that Trump knew how to do was get production to work correctly. And when he put through that operation to get it – Warp Speed, to get it, it worked because he worked with the markets — not against them., GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Former Reagan economist Art Laffer argues President Biden needs to 'stop paying people not to work' to clear up supply chain delays and help inflation. </td>

fully funded their 401(k)s, took advantage of the match and the Roth (IRA), went into individual Roths and good mutual funds, kind of boring, and they paid off their house, and they look up and they’re 46 years old or they are 36 years old or sometimes 56 years old and they’ve got a million dollars in their retirement, a half-million-dollar paid for house and that’s their first million dollars of net worth." , "There’s about 15 million of those in America," he went on to note.

401(k)s and dumping it into crypto as if it is a proven process to build wealth and it’s just not a proven process," Ramsey stressed, acknowledging that the "commodity" is "going to be around."

concerns about rising bond yields and worries about the Federal Reserve potentially accelerating the timing on its interest rate hikes in 2022. Additionally, a bitcoin mining outage caused by a

In Brazil, consumer prices data showed that inflation rose 10.06% in 2021, hotter than market expectations of a 9.97% increase, and well above the central bank’s target range of 3.75% ± 1.5%. Meanwhile, the US consumer prices data, due on January 12th, is awaited so traders can assess further clues on US policy rate hike timing. Prospects of higher rates have weighed on traders' investments recently driving them away from risky assets as the odds are rising that the Fed will raise the fed funds four times this year instead of three as previously signaled from the Central bank. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The global economy is expected to grow by 4.1 percent in 2022 and 3.2 percent in 2023, decelerating markedly from a 5.5 percent expansion in 2021, as pent-up demand dissipates and as fiscal and monetary support is unwound across the world, the World Bank’s latest Global Economic Prospects report showed. The forecasts for 2021 and 2022 were 0.2 percentage point lower than in June's projections. Also, the international institution has warned that new COVID-19 variants and a rise in inflation, debt, and income inequality threatened the recovery in developing economies. US GDP is seen rising by 3.7 percent in 2022 (vs 4.2 percent previously estimated) while the Eurozone should advance by 4.2 percent (vs 4.4 percent). China will probably grow by 5.1 percent (vs 5.4 percent), Japan by 2.9 percent (vs 2.6 percent) and India by 8.7 percent (vs 7.5 percent). </td>

Storms disrupted flights by delivering whipping winds, rains and heavy snowfall at airports nationwide, and the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant compounded the havoc by sickening thousands of airline workers, leaving many travelers stranded and angry.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Overall, about 3,000 United employees — more than 4 percent of the airline’s work force — have recently tested positive for the coronavirus, the company’s chief executive, Scott Kirby, said in his memo. The vast majority are not working, and United is cutting its flight schedule to manage the shortage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “Our frontline teams continue to put in a tremendous effort during what I know is an incredibly challenging and stressful time — the Omicron surge has put a strain on our operation, resulting in customer disruptions during a busy holiday season,” Mr. Kirby said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , United’s experience is not particularly extraordinary, and two other companies have canceled many more flights. All told, the industry has canceled more than 29,000 flights, or about 8 percent of all scheduled trips, since Dec. 25, according to FlightAware, a data tracking service. Many airlines say the virus is at least partly to blame.                                                                                                                                                                                           , The problems began to mount in the days before Christmas. That week, several top Delta Air Lines executives sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asking it to shorten the isolation period for fully vaccinated people infected by the virus, warning that the agency’s recommendation of 10 days would leave the airline without enough workers during a crucial period.                                                                                                                                          , “Similar to health care, police, fire and public transportation workforces, the Omicron surge may exacerbate shortages and create significant disruptions,” the executives, including Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, wrote in the Dec. 21 letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Cancellations topped 1,000 each day from Dec. 26, when heavy snows and bitter cold wreaked havoc on the Pacific Northwest, through Dec. 31. During that period, JetBlue executives told employees in a memo, the airline received “record-breaking sick calls.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , On Dec. 27, partly as a result of requests like the ones made by Delta Air Lines as well as some public health experts, the C.D.C. shortened its recommended isolation time for people who have been fully vaccinated to five days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But the change in health guidance would not give airlines much relief, at least not right away. The weather — and the flight cancellations — continued to get worse, peaking on Jan. 3, when airlines canceled more than 3,100 flights, or about 13 percent of all scheduled trips. It wasn’t until Monday that the number of daily flight cancellations fell below 1,000. In recent days, airlines have canceled many flights proactively to get a better handle on their operations and avoid surprising customers with last-minute changes., Bad weather and staffing problems hit different airlines at different times. Since Christmas, SkyWest Airlines, which operates shorter flights for major carriers, including United, has canceled more than 5,100 trips, more than any other airline. Southwest Airlines was close behind with more than 4,800 canceled flights, followed by United, with over 2,800 cancellations, and Delta, with more than 2,000.                                                                                                                          , Airlines have generally provided brief public explanations, and representatives for several companies, including American Airlines, Delta and Southwest, declined to elaborate on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In statements, SkyWest has blamed “a surge in Covid cases,” while Southwest said over the weekend that it was “experiencing an uptick” in sick calls and quarantines. The airline said on Tuesday that its operations were improving as it overcame the effects of a winter storm that slammed the East Coast, including its hub at Baltimore/Washington International Airport, at the start of the month.                                                                                                                                    , Like United, several airlines have started to prune flights this month to ensure they have the resources available to address the holiday disruptions and prevent further disarray. JetBlue said it would pre-emptively cut about 1,300 flights in the first half of January. Alaska said in a statement recently that it would slash about one in 10 flights planned for the month to gain “the flexibility and capacity needed to reset.”                                                                                                   , Flight cancellations have continued this week, though the number has fallen steadily in recent days. More than 700 flights on Tuesday were canceled, about 150 of them operated by United.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Several airlines have also adjusted their policies for infected employees to align with the new C.D.C. guidance, but the shortened isolation time is fueling debate within the industry. The Association of Flight Attendants-C.W.A., which represents nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, has urged health officials and airline managements to maintain the 10-day isolation period.                                                                                                                                            , The latest Covid data in the U.S. As the Omicron surge causes case counts to reach record highs and hospitalizations to surpass last winter’s peak, here’s how to think about the data and what it’s beginning to show about Omicron’s potential toll and the growing gap in those vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Biden administration’s response. At a Senate hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the heads of the C.D.C. and F.D.A. defended the administration’s efforts to protect Americans against Omicron as they faced withering accusations about scarce Covid tests and confusing guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Schools. As millions of students head back to their desks — Los Angeles started classes Tuesday and Chicago will reopen schools Wednesday — the testing that was supposed to help keep classrooms open safely is itself being tested as many districts struggle with execution and resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Around the world. The W.H.O. warned that more than half of people in Europe could be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks. In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is again accused of violating his own lockdown rules after hosting a party at 10 Downing Street.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Staying safe. Worried about spreading Covid? Keep yourself and others safe by following some basic guidance on when to test and how to use at-home virus tests (if you can find them). Here is what to do if you test positive for the coronavirus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “We believe this is the wrong move for aviation as it accepts that infectious people will be put back on the job or flying as passengers on our planes,” Sara Nelson, the union’s president, wrote in a recent letter to airlines. In interviews, several flight attendants also expressed concerns that contagious colleagues might return to work without being tested.                                                                                                                                                                     , Delta’s chief legal officer sent a cease and desist letter to Ms. Nelson’s union last week, accusing it of spreading “false and defamatory information” about the airline’s virus policies. On Tuesday, Ms. Nelson responded in a letter to Mr. Bastian, saying the union has been truthful and accurate and accusing Delta of sowing confusion among staff after changing its policies multiple times.                                                                                                                                       , Ms. Nelson’s union has been seeking to organize Delta flight attendants, the only such workers at a major airline not to be represented by a union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The vast majority of employees at major airlines are vaccinated, but while the vaccines generally protect against severe illness, they haven’t completely prevented breakthrough infections. And even those who exhibit few or no symptoms but test positive often have to isolate at least for some time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Kirby of United told his staff that despite breakthrough infections, United’s decision to require all employees to be vaccinated or secure an exemption was working. The company was one of the first large U.S. employers to implement a vaccine mandate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , No vaccinated employees are hospitalized, and the hospitalization rate among United employees since the mandate went into effect in the fall has been far lower than that of the general population, he said. Before the requirement, more than one United employee died each week from the virus, on average. The airline has gone eight weeks without a single virus-related death among vaccinated employees, Mr. Kirby noted.                                                                                                             , “In dealing with Covid, zero is the word that matters — zero deaths and zero hospitalizations for vaccinated employees,” he said. “And while I know that some people still disagree with our policy, United is proving that requiring the vaccine is the right thing to do because it saves lives.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Americans Are More Pessimistic: IBD/TIPP </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index in the US fell sharply to 44.7 in January of 2022 from 48.4 in December, a sign Americans turned more pessimistic as omicron case-levels exploded and inflation continued to hit generational highs. The six-month US economic outlook index slid 4.9 points to 37.9, the lowest level since July 2020. The major shift came among investors, who are suddenly feeling more bearish about the US economic outlook than they've been in more than five years. Also, the gauge of support for federal economic policies subindex sank 3.6 points to 43.9. The personal finances subindex fell 2.6 points to 52.3, well off its peak but still reflecting modest optimism. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, predicts the national average for gasoline could hit $4 a gallon in the spring before peaking in the summer.                                                                    , The average price of a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. has been on the rise for the first two weeks of 2022.                                                                                                                              , Currently, prices at the pump are standing at $3.29 per gallon, an increase of 2.3 cents from a week ago, according to GasBuddy, which compiles data from price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.           , Although the national average is down 5.5 cents per gallon compared to a month ago, it's still 97.5 cents per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data. Prices are projected to climb even higher as spring approaches. , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said gas prices have continued to increase even as gas demand struggles due to the fact that oil prices have "remained stubbornly strong."                                 , The fuel nozzle in a car at a gasoline pump at the Citgo gas station on Lancaster Ave in Reading, PA Monday afternoon September 20, 2021.  (Ben Hasty/MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images / Getty Images)                     , Crude oil prices notched nearly $80 per barrel last week, according to GasBuddy.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index traded around the flatline at the 21,070 level on Tuesday, as declines in the tech and healthcare sectors offset gains in energy while investors await for the release of US consumer price data tomorrow. American inflation is expected to have increased by 7% on the year during December, a four-decade high, strengthening the case for accelerated monetary policy tightening. Healthcare stocks loss 1.2%, led by Tilray (-4.9%,) as the cannabis producer partly trimmed yesterday’s 10% gain after announcing higher profits due to cost cuts. Bausch Health (-1%) also traded on the red. Tech shares fell 0.8%, led by Shopfiy (-2.3%). The e-commerce giant extended losses to fall 7.3% this year, in line with other tech stocks, due to expectations of rate hikes by the Fed in March. On the other hand, the energy sector tracked higher oil prices to trade 1.3% higher. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed Remains Prepared to Prevent Entrenched Inflation </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed Chair Powell sees inflationary pressures to last well into the middle of 2022 and expects the Fed to raise interest rates and end asset purchases this year while a balance-sheet contraction could perhaps start later in 2022. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Powell also noted the Fed could raise rates more if needed, to get inflation back to the target level and prevent it from becoming entrenched. The Fed announced at its December 2021 meeting it would end its pandemic-era bond purchases in March, paving the way for three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022. But FOMC minutes released later showed a more hawkish Fed, and the central bank signalled it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than previously anticipated. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Washington (CNN Business)An unusual ground stop was issued to some pilots for a short period of time following a North American Aerospace Defense Command alert of a launch of a North Korean missile, a US official said Tuesday.                                                                                                              , The official says it was not a national ground stop and may have been issued by a regional air traffic control facility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "No warning was issued by NORAD HQ," regarding a potential threat to the US, according to Captain Pamela Kunze, the chief NORAD spokesperson.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for the nation's air traffic control system, said the ground stop was to err on the side of safety.                                                                                                                                                                                            , "As a matter of precaution, the FAA temporarily paused departures at some airports along the West Coast on Monday evening," the FAA said in a statement. "Full operations resumed in less than 15 minutes. The FAA regularly takes precautionary measures. We are reviewing the process around this ground stop as we do after all such events.", The NORAD spokeswoman said the normal sequence following the launch was followed: The missile launch was detected, and it was assessed not to be a threat to the continental United States. The standard practice is for FAA to have a constant liaison in the NORAD ops center, therefore would have been aware of the quick assessment.       , LiveATC air traffic control recordings of the Burbank Airport in California detail a controller telling a Southwest flight "there's ground stops all departures, all airports right now.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> World Bank warns global economy faces grim outlook </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The global economy faces a "grim outlook", World Bank president David Malpass has warned, as the aftershocks of the pandemic continue to weigh on growth - especially in poor countries.                                                                                                                                                                     , His organisation's latest forecast predicts global growth will slow to 4.1% this year from 5.5% in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , It attributed the slowdown to virus threats, government aid unwinding and an initial rebound in demand fading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But Mr Malpass said his greatest worry was widening global inequality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "The big drag is the inequality that's built into the system," he told the BBC, noting that poorer countries were especially vulnerable to economic damage from efforts to fight inflation.                                                                                                                                                                  , "The outlook for the weaker countries is still to fall further and further behind. That causes insecurity."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , By 2023, economic activity in all advanced economies, such as the US, Euro area and Japan, is likely to have recovered from the hit it took during the pandemic, the bank said.                                                                                                                                                                              , But output in developing and emerging countries is expected to remain 4% lower than it was before Covid struck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr Malpass blamed stimulus programmes in the richest countries for worsening the divide by driving global inflation. While officials in many countries, including the US, are now expected to raise interest rates to try to rein in price increases, Mr Malpass warned higher borrowing costs could hurt economic activity - especially in weaker economies., "The problem with rate hikes is it hurts people that need floating rate money... and that's usually new businesses, women-owned businesses, developing country businesses," Mr Malpass said.                                                                                                                                                                 , Separately, the World Economic Forum (WEF) warned that divergent economic recoveries were making it harder to collaborate on global challenges such as climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                       , "Widening disparities within and between countries will not only make it more difficult to control Covid-19 and its variants, but will also risk stalling, if not reversing, joint action against shared threats that the world cannot afford to overlook," the WEF said in its annual global risks report on Tuesday.                                       , The World Bank's Global Economic Prospects report said that in 2021 the world's economy bounced back from the pandemic with the strongest post-recession expansion in 80 years.                                                                                                                                                                              , But the gains are expected to slow this year, as virus variants and rapidly rising prices for items such as food and energy weigh on households. Globally, inflation is at its highest rate since 2008, the report says.                                                                                                                                     , The bank, which lends to countries around the world, also warned that supply chain bottlenecks and the unwinding of stimulus programmes posed risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The slowdown in the second half of 2021 was already larger than the bank had expected in its June forecast due to the spread of the Omicron and Delta Covid variants. It expects a "pronounced slowdown" this year, and predicts global growth will decelerate further in 2023, to 3.2%.                                                                     , "The reality is that Covid and the shutdowns are still taking a huge toll and that's especially true on people in poorer countries," Mr Malpass said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, rose over 1% to around 103,050 on Tuesday, following a 0.9% loss in the prior session, lifted by heavyweight miner Vale and steel companies on rising iron ore prices and despite heavy rains that are disrupting activities throughout the country. Meanwhile, investors weighed prospects of faster monetary policy tightening by both the US Federal Reserve and the Brazilian central bank, after latest data showed inflation in Brazilan came in higher-than-expected at a six-year high of 10.06%, well above the upper limit of the central bank's year-end target range. Meanwhile, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga said that the Omicron has become the dominant coronavirus variant in Brazil, but he did not expect to see higher hospitalization and death levels, citing the strong vaccination program. </td>

"We continue to see hikes in March, June, and September, and have now added a hike in December for a total of four in 2022."                                                                                                                                                                   , Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell arrives to speak at a news conference, Tuesday, March 3, 2020, to discuss an announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee, in Washington.  ((AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) / AP Newsroom)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Goldman previously penciled in three interest rate increases this year, in line with the economic projections from Fed officials in December.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In forecasting the faster withdrawal of pandemic-era support for the economy, Hatzius noted the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in December and wages rose 0.6% from the previous month. Although employers added just 199,000 jobs, well below the consensus forecast for a gain of 400,000, the Goldman economist said he does not believe the Fed will be deterred by lackluster job growth as it moves to quell the hottest inflation in four decades. , The analyst note precedes the release of new Labor Department data this week, which is expected to show that inflation rose more than 7% in December from the year-ago period, the fastest pace since 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Hatzius, in addition to predicting four rate hikes next year, said he thinks the central bank will start running down its $8.8 trillion balance sheet no later than July – much sooner than the initial December forecast. He pointed to comments made last week by San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who suggested that policymakers could begin reducing their balance sheet after just one or two rate hikes.                                     , A man wearing a mask walks past the U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington D.C., the United States, on April 29, 2020.

"With inflation probably still far above target at that point, we no longer think that the start to runoff will substitute for a quarterly rate hike."                                                                                                                                                           , The Fed slashed rates to near zero in March 2020 and launched a massive $120 billion-a-month bond-buying program in order to insulate the economy from the pandemic, which froze business activity worldwide.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> At least 600,000 passengers scrapped plans to fly from Heathrow Airport last month as the Omicron coronavirus strain sparked tougher travel restrictions.                                                                                                                                          , Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said it underlined the crisis in the industry and the uncertainty facing travellers.                                                                                                                                                                               , A return to normal "could be years away", the chief executive of the UK's busiest airport warned.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Just 19.4 million passengers passed through Heathrow in 2021 - 12.3% below 2020, the year the pandemic began.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Last year's number, the lowest for Heathrow for 50 years, was less than a quarter of the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Mr Holland-Kaye said it was time for all coronavirus testing measures to be dropped for fully-vaccinated people.                                                        , Fears over the Omicron Covid variant meant that, from late November, all travellers arriving in the UK were required to take a pre-departure lateral flow test and self-isolate until they received a negative result from a post-arrival PCR test.                                                , This led to many people scrapping their travel plans over the festive period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The new rules were relaxed for fully-vaccinated arrivals last week after travel firms said they were ineffective due to Omicron spreading widely within the UK. That move sparked a rush of bookings, airlines reported.                                                                           , Mr Holland-Kaye said: "There are currently travel restrictions, such as testing, on all Heathrow routes - the aviation industry will only fully recover when these are all lifted and there is no risk that they will be re-imposed at short notice, a situation which is likely to be years away.", He warned this creates "enormous uncertainty" for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the aviation regulator, as it prepares to set a five-year cap on Heathrow's passenger charges.                                                                                                               , "The regulator must focus on an outcome that improves service, incentivises growth and maintains affordable private financing."                                                                                                                                                                    , The CAA increased the cap on Heathrow's price per passenger from £19.60 to £30.19 from 1 January, sparking complaints from airlines that the rise was far too high.                                                                                                                                , The CAA is expected to announce a long-term cap running from the summer to 2027 in the coming weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Heathrow said travel to and from the Asia-Pacific region in 2021 was particularly badly hit, down 40.3% from a year earlier.                                                                                                                                                                       , The other markets with double-digit reductions were non-EU Europe (down 13.8%) and North America (down 13.6%).                                                                                                                                                                                     , Domestic travel bucked the trend, with a 21.1% boost in passengers compared with 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Death in Paradise returns with a brand new series!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The Tourist: A tense new thriller starring Jamie Dornan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Baltic Exchange Dry Index Falls to 9-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Baltic Exchange Dry Index slumped by 5.5% to 2,151 on Tuesday, its lowest since April 13th, extending losses for a third straight session, amid weaker seasonal demand across all vessel segments. "We expect dry bulk spot rates to soften seasonally in 1Q22 before returning to cyclical strength in 2022 as demand growth is expected across all dry bulk commodities," analysts at financial services company Jefferies said. The capesize index, which tracks iron ore and coal cargos of 150,000-tonnes, slipped about 9% to 2,325; and the panamax index which tracks cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of coal and grains, fell 4.7% to 2,715. Among smaller vessels, the supramax index shed 43 points to its lowest level since April at 1,958. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Moxie Marlinspike leaves encrypted-messaging app Signal </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Moxie Marlinspike, the co-founder and chief executive of encrypted-messaging app Signal, has resigned.                                                                                                                                , He blogged it was a "good time to replace myself as CEO" after working on Signal for over a decade.                                                                                                                                   , Signal recently enabled crypto-currency payments within the app, which has concerned some users.                                                                                                                                      , Mr Marlinspike remains a board member of the Signal Foundation, while the board's executive chair, Brian Acton, becomes interim chief executive.                                                                                      , Mr Marlinspike - whose real name is Matthew Rosenfeld - blogged he had always hoped to reach a point where Signal could "grow and sustain" beyond his involvement.                                                                    , "I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone," he wrote.                                 , "I couldn't ever leave cell service, had to take my laptop with me everywhere in case of emergencies, and occasionally found myself sitting alone on the sidewalk in the rain late at night trying to diagnose a service degradation.", More than 40 million people now use Signal.                                                                                                                                                                                           , The app's popularity increased after planned changes to WhatsApp's privacy policy caused some users to switch.                                                                                                                        , It is free, and like WhatsApp, messages are automatically encrypted by default.                                                                                                                                                       , Both Signal and WhatsApp have benefited from Mr Marlinspike's skills as a programmer and cryptographer.                                                                                                                               , The Signal Protocol, which he developed, was also integrated into WhatsApp, as it has been into several other prominent instant-messaging apps.                                                                                       , While Mr Marlinspike's tenure as chief executive has seen Signal grow in popularity, a recent experiment with crypto-currency has troubled some users.                                                                                , In November, the app rolled out to all users a trial of an integrated payment system using a crypto-currency called MobileCoin - which claims to be both highly secure and environmentally friendly.                                  , Mr Marlinspike has reportedly provided technical advice to the crypto-currency start-up.                                                                                                                                              , Integrating a crypto-currency is, some say, a risky strategy, creating avenues for criminal misuse of the app and putting it within scope of financial legislation - such as anti-money-laundering laws - and regulation.             , Alex Stamos, formerly Facebook's chief security officer, told The Verge: "The addition of pseudo-anonymous money-transfer functions greatly increases their legal attack surface, while creating the possibility of real-life harms." , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Mr Marlinspike's replacement, Mr Acton, is also a veteran of the secure-messaging sector.                                                                                                                                             , Mr Acton left WhatsApp, which he co-founded, in 2017 - the messaging app had been sold to Facebook, in 2014, in a deal worth $19bn (£11.4bn) in cash and shares.                                                                      , He cites " differences surrounding the use of customer data and targeted advertising" as reasons for his departure from WhatsApp.                                                                                                     , And, in 2018, with Mr Marlinspike, he launched the Signal Foundation, providing funding of $50m.                                                                                                                                      , Death in Paradise returns with a brand new series!                                                                                                                                                                                    , The Tourist: A tense new thriller starring Jamie Dornan                                                                                                                                                                               , © 2022 BBC.

Commodity funds squared positions ahead of the release of the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report by the USDA on January 12th, as analysts expect the government to report the tightest US wheat stocks since the 2007/2008 marketing year. Further, data from the USDA indicates that ending stocks in the European Union are projected to be at 9.23 million tonnes during the 2021/2022 marketing year, the lowest level since data collection began in 2000, an indication that demand exceeds supply. </td>

Yes, MoM is important for data but important to CPI TOMORROW is what?
Yes, markets and Tutes will read data as what?

Yes, YoY, year over year since tomorrow&amp;#39;s data is accumulation OF WHOLE YEAR.

K, this will not be unnoticed by the bigs, retail even smart enough to see this factoid is observed to.

So, yrs, bulls, you will have a double whammy,  not only is CPI a good news bad, bad news bad very likely scenario, you also will want CPI a 5: # fir the year.

But, again, so, let&amp;#39;s say CPI drops .9% right so hits 5.9% for year.

NOW, you have an entirely new issue, SLOWING GROWTH. Markets won&amp;#39;t like that either.
In fact, inflation and rates will drop market 10% IF consumers will spend less as FED tightens rates--I already have u my thoughts earlier on this today &amp;amp; I think they won&amp;#39;t stop spending, spending themselves into oblivion--BUT, and, it is a big &amp;quot;but,&amp;quot; the opposite of hot economy is COLD, slowing down ine and now markets can drop 40-50%.

K, see where I went?

Well,  so CPI. 
&amp;#39;Course, worse, is a beat of 6.8%, by any amount really, I see tech down 100 by 0.1% beat or 1000 if surprises amd hits my 7.7% , with a 1.1% beat. 

K, but, let&amp;#39;s look at the tape, from the other side, guys, you k bbn ow, from the devil&amp;#39;s side, or, the bulls 😅😂

What happens IF inflation misses? 

Well, that&amp;#39;s bound to be interesting too, JPow just said, &amp;quot;2, or, 3, or 4&amp;quot; months to START QE in his chat to us today. Now, would that be bullish or bearish if that statement #s true. Well, bearish cuz Wall Street will think, Jan.,no, but TWO is March, for 1st raise but, I digress, and, get back to point.......

IF CPI comes in lower tomorrow, that&amp;#39;s following PMI lower, right, we speak of Jan. 4, right.

And did marke PMI&amp;#39;s miss? 

Noooooo, big DROp. 
Big drop.....Hmm.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ I hate to say this to bears but it could be a damned data day, you know, damned if it does, damned if it don&amp;#39;t, or, in simple: a PMI repeat event.

Well,  so CPI. 
&amp;#39;Course, worse, is a beat of 6.8%, by any amount really, I see tech down 100 by 0.1% beat or 1000 if surprises amd hits my 7.7% , with a 1.1% beat. 

K, but, let&amp;#39;s look at the tape, from the other side, guys, you k bbn ow, from the devil&amp;#39;s side, or, the bulls 😅😂

What happens IF inflation misses? 

Well, that&amp;#39;s bound to be interesting too, JPow just said, &amp;quot;2, or, 3, or 4&amp;quot; months to START QE in his chat to us today. Now, would that be bullish or bearish if that statement #s true. Well, bearish cuz Wall Street will think, Jan.,no, but TWO is March, for 1st raise but, I digress, and, get back to point.......

IF CPI comes in lower tomorrow, that&amp;#39;s following PMI lower, right, we speak of Jan. 4, right.

And did marke PMI&amp;#39;s miss? 

Noooooo, big DROp. 
Big drop.....Hmm.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ I think today was the result of short term oversold. At no point in history have we gone into a rate rising environment, the major indexes sell off for a week and then call it a day and march to new highs. Big doubt. I think as the year progresses, and rate hikes actually confirm and print, the 10 year will move to 2%. At that point speculation will begin about rate hikes for rest of the year as well as hikes in 2023. This will keep a lid on the market overall and potentially result in more downside. I think these S&amp;amp;P 5300 eoy targets are lofty at best. IF that does print, I&amp;#39;ll call it a blow off top and the last ditch effort of MMs to print gains on the backs of retail and I will definitely be selling into that strength. However I don&amp;#39;t think that is going to happen. These next few years should see averages cool and opportunities for accumulation present itself. Hopefully... 🙏   Good luck everyone! </td>

This whole situation (both the medical and fiscal response) really makes you look at history with more skepticism.  
  
Because you know in 2122 or 2222, they&amp;#39;ll be teaching of a &amp;quot;deadly pandemic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;suffering&amp;quot;. 
  
And conveniently leave out the fact that US home prices are up 20-40%.  More inflows into US equities in 2021 than in the past 20 YEARS COMBINED.  RollsRoyce, Bentley, Lambo, Ferrari, all saw HISTORIC deliveries in 2021, even beating out 2019 deliveries.  (Chip &amp;quot;shortage&amp;quot; was a just an excuse to hike prices).   Yachts, Dassault and Embraer jets, patek watches, dozens of other haute lux brands.  All saw demand in 2021 alone that exceeded 2010-2016 COMBINED. 
  
Due to a &amp;quot;pandemic&amp;quot; that kills about 1 in 1,000,000 people under the age of 25.     
  
Or, about as likely to be struck (and killed) by lightning.

You get the picture.

Can you stay irrational, standing on JPow&amp;#39;s words said today that inflation will improve, as you inflation wildly move into Spring? 7%, 9%, 12%.

I&amp;#39;m guessing actual CPI increases, could be higher, in 1970s, inflation went from 5% to 12% for the year and markets gained 5% for the year. 
Interestingly, or, maybe, not so, interesting, after years of S&amp;amp;P 91% and 23% on 2020, 2021, it is projected in 2022 to gain 4.5%. 

Stocks probably not going to be the place you&amp;#39;d money best well spent.

Sometimes truth hurts. You can’t have room for feelings and emotions in this game if you want to be successful. NOT BLOCKING PEOPLE on here has been one of the BEST decisions I have EVER made in my entire life, because THOSE SAME PEOPLE I was arguing with three months ago are the SAME PEOPLE I’m making money with today. 
It may SEEM like insults… but sometimes people just need the truth told to them and sometimes the truth hurts….So if you can’t handle the heat THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE KITCHEN!!! </td>

CPI tomorroWWWWWWWHOA! 

That&amp;#39;s enough, just like inflated like crazy, completely started suffocating me as I got just to room door in time.

Btw, the little sticker on inside my hotel room door, says prices can be anywhere from $145 to $290 per night......I paid 270......

K, let ucce c. what. tomorrow&amp;#39;s. #. beholds.

Chop? Or, the real deal, an interest rate that screams shockingly to Mr. Powell, &amp;quot;FEBRUARY. We must both runoff MBS &amp;amp; balance sheet completely and do a DOUBLE RATE initial hike. Wow, I never thought it&amp;#39;s come to this.&amp;quot;

Note, all this said ONE DAY AFTER TELLING MARKETS INFLATION IS GOING TO BE OK.

OH, the inflation #, what do I guess.

It will be purrrrrr-fect, 7.7%.

Ivermectin &amp;#39;Works Throughout All Phases&amp;#39; Of COVID According To Leaked Military Documents 
 
TUESDAY, JAN 11, 2022 - 03:03 PM 
Update (1505ET): As more and more information pours out of the Project Veritas leaked military documents, there appears to be a damning section in support of Ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment. 
 
&amp;quot;Ivermectin (identified as curative in April 2020) works throughout all phases of illness because it both inhibits viral replication and modulates the immune response.&amp;quot;

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ quite the concerted effort by the sell side analysts to tell everyone to buy the dip, upgrading all the mega caps. Still nowhere else to put your money as bond yields are still negative with the current rate of inflation. The $FED policy shift is real but likely only ushers in higher levels of volatilty $VIX  as QE ends. $TNX the rate of change in yields and their ability to continue to move up is what can put pressure on equities. The trillion dollar question is will rates continue to rise and will the Fed fight inflation or save the stock market? IMO They can&amp;#39;t do both. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $QQQ i think people (beartards mostly) are majorly confused by interest rates/tapering.  the discount rate for out year earnings is NEVER the 10 year govt bond.  it is always much much much higher once you factor in the equity risk premium for a given business and the 10 year bond ends up being a rounding error in that calculation down at these levels.  if you are bearish because you think the 10 year might go from 1.75% to 2.5% as the Fed tapers and inflation persists, guess what, that is what the BULLS fully expect MIGHT happen too and they DON&amp;#39;T CARE.  In fact it is easy to argue it will make many market participants prefer the key constituents of the QQQ over many other stocks who rely on debt funding and can&amp;#39;t raise prices as easily and certainly over fixed income assets themselves.  also when the Fed raises short term rates the big cap tech stocks will make more money on their large cash balances.  In other words more fund flows will be in this direction, not away from it. </td>

The display technology used in the &amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; model is expected to include 120Hz ProMotion and a mini LED backlight. These features paired with the M1 Pro and M1 Max would make the new iMac comparable to the renewed MacBook Pro lineup. </td>
