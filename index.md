   <td style="text-align:left;"> Trump's presidential diarist tells Jan. 6 committee White House officials provided less detail about his activities days before riot - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Washington (CNN)Just days before the US Capitol riot, White House officials started providing fewer details about then-President Donald Trump's calls and visits, the person in charge of compiling those activities for the official record told the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, according to two sources with knowledge of the probe.                                                                                                                                  , The committee interviewed Trump's presidential diarist roughly two weeks ago. That interview has not been previously reported, nor has the testimony describing a noticeable drop-off in information provided by Oval Office staff leading up to January 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Other witnesses also have told the panel there was significantly less information being shared with those involved in White House record-keeping during the same time period, according to three sources familiar with the investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , One source described how White House record-keepers appeared to be "iced out" in the days leading up to January 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The last day that normal information was sent was the 4th," said another source familiar with the investigation. "So, starting the 5th, the diarist didn't receive the annotated calls and notes. This was a dramatic departure. That is all out of the ordinary."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The White House diarist normally receives many streams of information, including the phone logs from the switchboard, the president's movements from the US Secret Service and, critically, the notes from Oval Office operations, which detail calls, guests and activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , But sources close to the panel's investigation do not seem to know yet who, if anyone, directed a change in record-keeping or what the motivation behind that change was, raising questions about whether the lack of information was intentional or for staffing issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "It's tough to know what that change was. Was it intentional?" one source said. "You can only keep track of something when you know what's going on. When people don't share things with you, whether that was intentional and who decided that, I think it's a little murky at this point."                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The House committee declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , CNN reached out to a spokesman for Trump and did not hear back. CNN has also reached out to the National Archives for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , These revelations come as the House select committee is trying to understand what Trump was doing (and not doing) during a seven-hour gap that exists in the White House call log and the presidential diary from January 6, 2021. The recently revealed switchboard call log and the presidential diary for the day contain no information about the then-President's actions during the riot, including phone calls that are known to have occurred and should have been documented in the diary., CNN previously reported that a likely explanation for the gap in the phone log is that Trump used cell phones, direct landlines or aides' phones that bypassed the White House switchboard. An official review of the call logs found no missing pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , While the select committee does not have detailed notes about the comings and goings into the Oval Office on January 6, they have received testimony that has helped fill in some of the gaps, according to a source familiar with the investigation. That includes calls Trump made and received, as well as who was with him in the private dining room off the Oval Office as he reportedly watched the riot unfold on television.                                                              , The presidential diary that was generated for January 6 contains scant details. It lists information from the switchboard call logs and Trump's public schedule but little else besides a phone call the former President had with an "unidentified individual" at 11:17 a.m. And there are no entries in the diary for roughly three hours, from 1:21 p.m. to 4:03 p.m.                                                                                                                           , The Presidential Records Act outlines that the office of the presidency has an obligation to adequately document activities of the president. But there is little to no enforcement mechanism to ensure the law is followed. While there are criminal consequences for the destruction of government records, there are none that penalize the failure to create them in the first place.                                                                                                          , No explanation has been given so far as to why calls known to have been made in the hours Trump was in the Oval Office are not documented in the presidential diary. But around that time, a number of factors could have reduced the flow of information into the official record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , For one, sources told CNN that early January was a chaotic time inside the White House and that Trump was spending more time in the residence and conducting less official business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , According to one former Trump official, "all sense of normal order started to break down" and around early January, "the cracks were showing."  While some people had been looking to find other jobs, others had been confused and it became "every man for himself," the former official added.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , CNN's Pamela Brown, Gloria Borger, Ashley Semler, Katelyn Polantz and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Amazon workers win battle to form first US union </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A team of Amazon workers has forced the technology giant to recognise a trade union in the US for the first time.                                                                                                                                           , Workers at a New York warehouse voted 55% in favour of joining the Amazon Labor Union.                                                                                                                                                                      , The group is led by former Amazon worker Chris Smalls, who made his name protesting against safety conditions at the retail giant during the pandemic.                                                                                                      , Mr Smalls' victory marks a major defeat for Amazon, which had fiercely fought against unionisation.                                                                                                                                                         , However, in Alabama, where Amazon was facing a separate union drive, the company appeared to have fended off activists in a tight contest in which challenged ballots could yet overturn that result.                                                       , Together, the two elections mark a milestone for activists, who have long decried labour practices at Amazon, the country's second largest employer.                                                                                                        , Mr Smalls emerged from the vote count looking tired but jubilant, and popped open a bottle of champagne he was handed by supporters.                                                                                                                        , "We did whatever it took to connect with these workers," he told the crowd, recounting an against-the-odds campaign that started with "two tables, two chairs and a tent" and relied on an online fundraiser for money.                                     , "I hope that everybody's paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us."                                                                                                                                                                          , In a statement, Amazon said it was disappointed by the loss in New York and that it was evaluating how to proceed. It also accused regulators of improperly influencing the vote.                                                                           , "We believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees," the company said. "We're evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the [National Labor Relations Board]". , Rebecca Givan, professor of labour studies at Rutgers University, said Amazon's defeat by Mr Smalls and his team of worker-organisers was a "really big deal", calling it a "David and Goliath story" that upset the odds.                                  , But she warned he will be facing another tough fight when it comes to contract negotiations.                                                                                                                                                                , "Amazon will do everything it can do undo this success, to break up these workers and to try to stop the momentum that will inevitably come from this victory," she said.                                                                                   , After the vote, Chris Smalls was instantly surrounded by supporters and assembled camera crews.                                                                                                                                                             , He and his team of worker organisers had struck out on their own, creating a brand new, independent labour union to launch their fight against Amazon.                                                                                                      , Their victory was a moment of vindication for the former Amazon worker, whom the company once called "not smart, or articulate" in a leaked strategy memo.                                                                                                  , But, as he told the crowd, it is far bigger than that.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Amazon employs more than one million people in the US and it has extraordinary influence on work practices - even outside its doors.                                                                                                                        , The company has put up a wall of resistance to unions since its inception.                                                                                                                                                                                  , With this win, activists are hoping that wall is about to crumble.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Amazon has already poured resources into fighting the unionising efforts, which it sees as an obstacle to business flexibility and warehouse efficiency.                                                                                                    , Officials have said the company offers competitive pay and benefits and believes it is better to work directly with workers. In meetings about the vote, representatives questioned union leaders' ability to win more in contract negotiations.            , Amazon said it may challenge the results, citing the timing of a decision by the National Labor Relations Board to sue the company last month alleging unfair labour practices in New York.                                                                 , As part of its statement, it shared comments by two of the country's most powerful business lobbies also raising objections, including a letter from the National Retail Federation to congressional leaders that called for an investigation of the matter., Mr Smalls said he was undaunted by the challenges ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The 33-year-old had worked for Amazon for more than four years before the company fired him in 2020, after his coronavirus protest, citing quarantine violations.                                                                                           , He established the Amazon Labor Union last year, calling for higher pay, stronger medical benefits, anti-discrimination policies and better leave among other changes.                                                                                      , The 2,654 to 2,131 victory gives his group the right to negotiate a contract with Amazon for the roughly 8,000 workers at the Staten Island warehouse.                                                                                                      , His team is also behind a second union campaign at a smaller warehouse in the same industrial park, which is scheduled for a vote later this month.                                                                                                         , "There's no doubt in my mind we're going to be successful in that one as well," he said.                                                                                                                                                                    , Organisers said Amazon made critical mistakes ahead of the vote, such as pushing to reverse policies relaxed under Covid, including allowing workers to keep their mobiles with them while working.                                                         , Still they said their win in some ways surprised even them, despite the intense efforts they had made to reach out to workers and make their case ahead of the vote.                                                                                        , "Watching all of this come true is pretty crazy," said Karen Ponce, Amazon worker and secretary of the Amazon Labor Union.                                                                                                                                  , The union drives at Amazon come amid an upswell of labour activism in the US.                                                                                                                                                                               , In recent months, organisers have led successful campaigns at coffee chain Starbucks, media outlets, smaller retailers and others.                                                                                                                          , Analysts say the pandemic galvanised workers worried about their safety. The rapid rebound of the economy since the coronavirus shock has also produced an unusually tight labour market, giving workers more leverage.                                     , But across the US, just 6.1% of private sector workers belong to unions.                                                                                                                                                                                    , "It continues to be very difficult for workers to organize collectively," Prof Givan said.                                                                                                                                                                  , In Alabama, workers at the Bessemer warehouse voted 993 to 875 against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, regulators said on Thursday.                                                                                               , More than 400 challenged ballots have yet to be counted and could change that result.                                                                                                                                                                       , The unofficial tally showed a much closer election than the lopsided victory that Amazon claimed after last year's election, which regulators later declared invalid, ordering a do-over citing labour rule violations by Amazon.                           , Turnout was also lower, with less than 40% of the more than 6,000 people working at the Bessemer warehouse casting votes in the election.                                                                                                                   , Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, which led the unionising drive in Alabama, said he was excited by the possibility of a union victory in New York.                                                           , Crediting Mr Smalls and his team, he also said their win in part reflected differences between New York - where one in five workers is unionised - and Alabama, which is a notoriously anti-labour state.                                                   , He said his union's initial union effort at the Amazon warehouse in Alabama last year had "ignited a movement".                                                                                                                                             , "Regardless of the final outcome, workers here have shown what is possible," he said at a press conference on Thursday following the Alabama count.

My actions at the 94th Academy Awards presentation were shocking, painful, and inexcusable. The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home. I betrayed the trust of the Academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film. So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate. Change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.", Friday's statement was by far Smith's most contrite take on the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , He initially apologized to the Academy during his televised acceptance speech for best actor, about forty minutes after the slap.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fracking 'worth exploring' says British Gas owner Centrica </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fracking could boost UK energy supplies and reduce bills, according to Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica.                                                                                       , The UK government placed a moratorium on fracking in 2019, amid fierce local opposition and fears of earthquakes.                                                                                                         , Mr O'Shea said there needed to be an "informed debate" about it.                                                                                                                                                          , However, environmental group Greenpeace said there had been "a decade of hype and bluster" around shale gas.                                                                                                              , Fracking is the process of drilling into the earth, then directing a high pressure mixture of chemicals into layers of rock to release shale gas.                                                                         , "We do have to be careful, if it does cause earthquakes, it's not something we should do," Mr O'Shea said.                                                                                                                , The UK met 48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies in 2020, and bought the rest on international markets, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.                                  , Mr O'Shea told BBC Radio 5Live's Big Green Money show: "The key question is, do we want to source our gas from overseas? Or do we want to have more gas domestically? And shale is certainly worth exploring."            , The UK has only ever had one fracking site in operation, which halted in 2019 following a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA).                                                                                      , The indefinite suspension came after the OGS found was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice.                                                                                 , However, this year regulators gave owners Cuadrilla an extra year to re-evaluate the site before it could be sealed up in 2023.                                                                                           , Mr O'Shea urged informed debate on fracking.                                                                                                                                                                              , What is fracking and why is it controversial?

But some employees are walking away from name-brand institutions in search of more risk, and potentially, more reward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. JPMorgan has one of the largest crypto teams, with more than 200 employees working in its Onyx division. The JPM Coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world.                                                                  , Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx by JPMorgan, said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank's brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start-up. But when products are launched, they reach "a scale that a fintech can only dream of."                                                                                                                                                        , "There aren't many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months," Farooq told CNBC. "That sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like JPMorgan Chase. The upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls.", When it comes to hiring, Farooq said it's a mix of current JPMorgan employees and competing for talent with start-ups and bigger tech companies. From first-year analysts to senior management and managing directors, there's a greater interest in making the move to crypto, he said.                                                                                                                                      , Financial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015, according to recent data from LinkedIn. In the first half of 2021, that pace jumped by 40%. Banks on a crypto hiring spree included Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One, Barclays, Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America and BNY Mellon.                                                                                  , The crypto boom on Wall Street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start-up world. Crypto and blockchain companies raised a record $25 billion last year, an eightfold increase from a year earlier, according to CB Insights data.                                                                                                                                                                                 , Farooq said that even with the start-up boom, JPMorgan has seen "limited attrition." Those leaving have been people "wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar."                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , However, JPMorgan did lose one of its highest-profile crypto deputies last year. Christine Moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at Onyx. She has yet to announce her next move.                                                                                                                                                                       , "After over a half-decade laying the foundations for blockchain-based infrastructure across financial markets and cross-border payments, creating new businesses that have already scaled into the $USD billions at J.P. Morgan, I am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the Web3/crypto ecosystem from a new angle," Moy told CNBC in an email.           , Other top crypto executives who left Wall Street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mary Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, left her job as a managing director at BlackRock last year. Her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "It certainly wasn't my primary job," Lader said. "It was kind of a hobby, as it is for so many people on Wall Street, and it definitely wasn't something that at the time I was thinking about, because it was early stages of adoption."                                                                                                                                                                                    , At Uniswap, Lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. She said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "This technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn't feel like a risk at all," Lader said. "I was sad to leave the people I had loved working with for many years. I have tremendous respect for the firm, but it didn't feel like a risk. That's a great thing about where we are in Web3."                                                                                                               , Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs, made a similar career change last year. He joined institutional crypto trading platform Talos and described the risk in a similar way, calling the decision "multidimensional."                                                                                                                                                                        , "Inherently, you're taking a brand risk — Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street," Schmidt said. "You are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional, and I very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there's a generational opportunity here."                                                                                                                             , Cryptocurrency start-ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent. Many are looking beyond top candidates with MBAs, and instead considering those with less conventional resumes. Lader and Schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self-taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on Twitter.                                                                           , "I constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old, who are as smart about markets as people I worked with on Wall Street for years," Lader said. "People who frankly had no interest in financial services, who would never really explore or consider working on Wall Street, are excited to work at UniSwap Labs and companies like us."                                                                                 , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada 10Y Bond Yield Rises </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s 10-year government bond rose to 2.432%, as the gap between U.S. and Canadian bond yields moved in favor of the U.S. bonds. U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply, approaching an almost three-year high levels, as a strong jobs report for March strengthened the case for an aggressive rate hike by the Fed to stem the soaring inflation. Meanwhile, on the domestic front, the Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnight rate by 25bps to 0.5%, the first hike since October 2018, reiterating it will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to the 2% target. It is expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points during the April 13th meeting and 200-220 basis points further this year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian dollar weakened towards 1.2512 against its US counterpart and was on a track to decline 0.3% in a week amid retreating prices of oil, one of Canada’s major exports; a stronger US dollar; and a shift in yield advantage between the US and Canadian bonds. U.S. Treasury yields rose sharply as the strong jobs report in the United States strengthened the case for an aggressive rate hike by the  Fed, with the US 2-year yield climbing to 10 basis points above its Canadian counterpart from a level of 1 basis point below, and thereby increasing the attractiveness of owning the US dollar. Meanwhile, Canada’s central bank is expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points during the April 13th meeting and between 200-250 basis points further this year after rising the borrowing cost last month for the first time since March 2020. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ukraine war to halve global trade growth, warns WTO </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Ukraine war has led the World Trade Organization (WTO) to cut its global trade growth forecast for this year.                                                                                                                                           , The previous 4.7% growth forecast has been cut to 2.5% due to "the impact of the war and related policies", said WTO boss Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.                                                                                                           , The cut is also linked to continuing global supply chain problems that started as a result of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                 , She said disruptions would make food more costly, saying "my worry is that we have a food crisis that is brewing".                                                                                                                                          , Dr Okonjo-Iweala told the BBC that although Russia and Ukraine only make up about 2.5% of global merchandise exports, they "are very, very significant in certain sectors".                                                                                 , "The first worry, of course, is for the people of Ukraine, who are being displaced [and] not having enough food to eat," she said.                                                                                                                          , She added the global economy was "going to suffer some severe consequences", and said poorer countries would particularly feel the impact of the shortages, and "the supply constraints on food".                                                           , Supplies of many food products including wheat and corn have been affected following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                          , Industry groups have warned the EU faces a shortage of sunflower oil. In total, 46.9% of global exports come from Ukraine and 29.9% from Russia according to S&amp;P Global, but with Ukraine's ports closed it is struggling to export it.                     , "I'm truly worried about looming hunger, particularly in poor countries that can least afford it," Dr Okonjo-Iweala warned.                                                                                                                                 , Using Africa as an example, the former Nigerian finance minister said 35 of 55 countries there imported wheat and other grains from Russia and Ukraine and 22 imported fertiliser.                                                                          , "Work being done by the African Development Bank now shows that in many countries, food prices are rising by 20% to 50% already," she said.                                                                                                                 , However, Dr Okonjo-Iweala said she was hopeful there were solutions to the supply problems.                                                                                                                                                                 , She said in the short term countries could be "changing our dietary tastes" to eat more homegrown products.                                                                                                                                                 , She added in the longer term Africa was investing in "heat tolerant varieties of wheat and other crops" as it adapts to climate change.                                                                                                                     , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , As well as food prices surging, the cost of other commodities have hit record highs amid concerns the war and economic sanctions on Russia will lead to supply disruptions.                                                                                 , Russia's mining industry is hugely important for many substances such as palladium, where it is responsible for 40% of global production of the metal that is essential for carmakers.                                                                      , Even before the war in Ukraine, the pandemic had caused a mismatch between supply and demand in many industries which pushed prices up, and the International Monetary Fund has warned that soaring inflation will reduce global economic growth this year. , "In the short to medium term, I think that we are going to see these inflationary pressures continue," Dr Okonjo-Iweala said.                                                                                                                               , Trade has become a key tool many countries have used to pressure President Vladimir Putin over his decision to invade Ukraine.                                                                                                                              , Ukraine has cut economic ties with Russia and led calls for it to be suspended from the WTO because of the war. However no country has ever been expelled from the WTO, something the Director-General said is "not an easy thing to do".                   , She says there is no mechanism to kick Russia out despite some leading international trade lawyers disagreeing.                                                                                                                                             , You can watch Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's full interview on "Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst" this weekend.                                                                                                                                             , Viewers in the UK can watch the show on Sunday at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel.                                                                                                                                                                            , In other countries, it will be on BBC World News at Saturday at 23:30 GMT,  Sunday at 05:30 &amp; 16:30 GMT and Monday at 07:30 &amp; 16:30 GMT                                                                                                                     , Romesh Ranganathan investigates the musician's death                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Robert Plant on how he felt about fronting Led Zeppelin                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Watch all four series of The Bridge on iPlayer                                                                                                                                                                                                              , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazilian Stocks Close at 8-Month High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo Index, Ibovespa, rebounded from last session’s decline and ended 1.31% higher to close the week at 121,570. It posted the highest value since August 1st of 2021, tracking the strong US jobs report, which strengthened the case of a 0.5% rate hike and reduced fears of a possible recession in the world's largest economy. Moreover, sentiment was boosted by investor’s reduced risk aversion as the new rounds of peace talks started between Russia and Ukraine and amid a strong foreign inflow of investments on the back of Brazil’s high interest rate. Gains were mainly led by stocks linked to commodities and personal consumption. On the week, the Ibovespa advanced 2.1% and posted weekly gain for the third time in a row. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Oil extended losses on Friday as members of the International Energy Agency agreed to join the US in the largest release of oil reserves on record. Brent crude closed 0.3% lower at $104 and WTI crude settled down 1% at $99 per barrel, bringing the weekly loss to more than 13%, the biggest weekly fall in two years. Oil prices fell sharply yesterday as US President Biden announced a release of 1 million barrels per day for six months starting in May, the largest release ever from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Losses also came on the back of demand concerns from top consumer China, after it reintroduced lockdown measures to curb a resurgence of Covid-19. </td>

Moreover, domestic sentiment strengthned as Canada's manufacturing PMI rose to a 11-1/2-year high of 58.9 in March. Gains were driven primarily by energy and mining stocks on back of surging commodity prices with Peyto Exploration (+6.8%), Ero Copper (+6.4%), Sandstorm (+5.3%), and Oceana Gold (+5.1%) leading the gains. On the other hand, industrials, health care and consumer staples weighed on the markets. On the week, the TSX declined 0.24%. </td>

Drabinsky decided which of the two understudies should take her place. A few minutes later, he spoke with the director Moisés Kaufman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “You’re happy with the choice?” Drabinsky asked. He listened. “Yeah, right, but make sure that she can really deliver ‘Someone to Love,’” one of the musical’s big ballads. “And the comedy.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The days before an opening are always stressful for a Broadway producer. But few have been under a harsher spotlight than Drabinsky, a storied Canadian impresario whose return to Broadway has generated the sort of drama that even he couldn’t have scripted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , First came the pandemic, which delayed the show’s Broadway opening by two years. Then an out-of-town run in Chicago last fall drew mixed reviews and (hampered by the Covid-19 surge) disappointing sales. The show’s preview performances on Broadway have earned only around $350,000 per week at the box office, with most of the seats filled by heavily discounted or even free tickets. That’s not the best omen for a producer who is staking everything on his big comeback after an ignominious fall.                                                                                                                                                       , He was a brash outsider even during his heyday in the 1990s, when he took a string of Tony-winning musicals to Broadway, among them “Ragtime,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman” and a revival of “Show Boat.” Then, in 1998, his company, Livent, imploded, and Drabinsky was accused of understating expenses and inflating profits in order to disguise the company’s precarious financial state. He was eventually convicted of fraud and forgery in his native Canada, and served 17 months of a five-year sentence, before being paroled in February 2013.                                                                                                            , Now, he’s back. And he hasn’t lost his salesman’s bravado, his lawyerly verbosity or his passion for theater, even though his show has faced many challenges, including questions about its financial health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , As New York rehearsals started in February, stories began circulating about slow payments, contract problems and a budget ($13.5 million, according to Drabinsky) that seemed on the slim side for a big Broadway musical with a performing company of nearly 40 and a producer known for lavish spending. Actors Equity, the performers’ union, even instructed the cast not to show up for rehearsals one day, so that it could deal with a “failure to provide our members with contracts reflecting their agreed-upon terms of employment” and “a myriad of other significant contract violations,” according to an Equity statement.                            , “When Garth Drabinsky is involved, people are rightly concerned that all the I’s are dotted and the T’s are crossed,” said David Levy, an Equity spokesman. The problems were apparently resolved, but it was hardly the sort of incident anyone wants at the outset of a Broadway run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Drabinsky blamed a delay in delivering final contracts for the dispute, and misunderstandings about what the actors were owed when the show transferred to New York from Chicago. “The Chicago contract froze the deal for New York,” he said. “There was no variation allowed. They were asking for something we were not committed to give.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , What’s more, Drabinsky stressed, he is not in charge of the show’s finances — an arrangement made explicit by the limited partnership formed to bring it to Broadway. “I walked away from every element of fiscal control of this show,” he added. “I don’t sign checks. I don’t get involved. I never want to live through the horror of what I went through in 1998 again.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Instead, he’s been working to get “Paradise Square” in shape for Broadway. The show began life nine years ago with a small-scale musical called “Hard Times,” written by the Irish American musician Larry Kirwan, lead singer of the rock band Black 47. It is set during the Civil War, in the gritty Five Points neighborhood of Manhattan, where Irish immigrants and freed Black Americans lived together — and where Stephen Foster (whose music formed the bulk of the score) resided during his final years. The show climaxes with the draft riots of 1863, when white working-class New Yorkers formed violent racist mobs following a draft lottery.      , Drabinsky loved the concept, but shied away from anchoring the show in Foster’s music, with its romanticization of the slavery-era South. So he set about reworking the piece, hiring the composer Jason Howland to write a new score (only two Foster songs remain), a succession of writers to shift the story’s focus to the owner of a neighborhood saloon (played by the Tony nominee Joaquina Kalukango), and a top-notch creative team, including Kaufman, as the director, along with the choreographer Bill T. Jones.                                                                                                                                       , The themes of racial justice and the immigrant experience have long attracted Drabinsky, and their currency has only grown in the years of development, which included a 2019 workshop production in Berkeley, Calif. “When the show began to parallel what was happening today in America and the world, it was sort of freaky,” he said. “And it hasn’t stopped changing. Even to the point that days before our first preview, Russia invades Ukraine. Three million immigrants are now looking for a new home.”                                                                                                                                                  , Drabinsky also made an effort to diversify the creative team, hiring Christina Anderson, a Black playwright, to revise Craig Lucas and Kirwan’s script, and the composer-lyricist Masi Asare, who collaborated with Nathan Tysen on the lyrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Still, suspicion of Drabinsky runs high in the Broadway community, where many were burned financially by his company’s bankruptcy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Yet some people clearly are willing to give him another shot. The list of more than 30 producers for “Paradise Square” includes few established Broadway names, but many who have confidence in Drabinsky’s record as a dedicated, hands-on producer. Among them are the former Queens congressman Joe Crowley (who was brought into the project by Kirwan); Matthew Blank, the former head of Showtime who is now interim chief executive of AMC Networks; and Richard Stursberg, a former top executive at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.                                                                                                                  , “I liked the dynamic of this motivated producer, needy of success, putting it all on the line,” said Jeffrey Sine, another producer, whose Broadway credits include “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.” “I think people deserve a second chance.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Or third or fourth. Drabinsky, 72, grew up in Toronto. At age 4 he contracted polio and spent much of his childhood in hospitals, distracting himself with music on his transistor radio — everything from ’50s rock ’n’ roll to Charles Aznavour. He earned a law degree, but soon turned to the entertainment business, building the Cineplex Odeon chain of movie theaters, before resigning in 1989 amid concerns about the company’s financial health.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , He re-emerged as a theater mogul, parlaying a long-running Toronto production of “The Phantom of the Opera” at his Pantages Theater into a far-flung company, Livent, that owned theaters (in New York, Chicago and elsewhere) and produced the shows that went into them. He pioneered a new business model for Broadway: Rather than cobbling together investors for each new show, Livent was a vertically integrated company that used the profits from its theaters and touring shows to finance the new work.                                                                                                                                                  , But it all came crashing down in 1998, after the struggling company was bought by the Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz and the investment banker Roy Furman, who discovered bookkeeping irregularities. Drabinsky was fired; bankruptcy followed; and fraud charges were brought against Drabinsky and his longtime associate Myron Gottlieb, both in the Southern District of New York and (after Drabinsky fled to Toronto) in Canada as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Drabinsky doesn’t like to talk much about that time. His finances were decimated, and his reputation a shambles. A rare bright spot was the Orthodox rabbi who began visiting him in prison. “It came at the time when I was at my absolute lowest emotionally,” he said. “It gave me a bit of a second wind.” He said he and the rabbi have met regularly for lunch ever since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Two years after his release from prison, he received a diagnosis of Stage 4 melanoma, cancer of the skin that had metastasized to his lungs. (After a year of immunotherapy, he said he is cancer free.) He returned to producing with the musical “Sousatzka” (backed by a Canadian company in which he has no financial interest), but that closed in Toronto after poor reviews. And still, Drabinsky was unable to travel to the United States because of the pending indictment against him in New York. That changed in July 2018, when the New York prosecutors dismissed the charges, noting that he had already served time for essentially the same crimes., “Paradise Square” is the sort of serious, original musical that Broadway claims to want more of. Yet without a major star, or a presold brand to market (and little advertising thus far), it faces a tough road. Much is riding on the critics’ reactions, which will come after Sunday’s opening. But Drabinsky remains upbeat, citing the “wonderful” audience response and positive tweets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “I made the decision, in terms of marketing, that our best course was to ensure that we filled the previews to capacity at whatever average ticket price we could get, and let word of mouth take over,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , His showman’s optimism is bolstered by a sober, even sentimental, belief in redemption. “There is a spirit in the soul of this country,” he said, “that allows somebody the opportunity to come back and work hard and be able to deliver a cultural work hopefully that will be meaningful. It’s one of the things that fills my heart every day.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Whether “Paradise Square” fills the seats at the Ethel Barrymore Theater will decide if Drabinsky has a future on Broadway — or whether it’s back to square one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Stocks Close Slightly Higher </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> All three main US stock indexes turned slightly positive in the late trading on Friday as investors digested a slew of data releases while looking ahead to tighter monetary policy. The Dow Jones closed more than 100 points higher while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3%. The latest employment report showed US employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, but the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6% and wages growth accelerated again. Meanwhile, March manufacturing data from ISM came below expectations. A tighter job market and soaring inflation are paving the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points in May. Industrial and technology shares underperformed in afternoon trading, while energy stocks were trading higher. Market moves came after all three major averages posted their worst quarter since March 2020. </td>

"These products are incredibility complicated."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, considers leveraged and inverse ETFs, equity indexed annuities and reverse convertibles as complex products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , It may not be enough to even have a Ph.D. in economics to understand the sophisticated instruments, according to Gorman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "This is classic Warren Buffett. If you don't understand it, you can't invest in it. And, that's what's happening here," he said. "The first line of defense here is the broker-dealer. The broker-dealer is supposed to have policies and procedures in place that say this is how you teach people about this stuff. This is what this stuff is. And in the cases the SEC brought, those weren't being followed.", Main Management CEO Kim Arthur highlights the wide availability of alternative investments on trading platforms as problematic. His firm caters to institutional clients and high net worth individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "We do use complex products, mostly options. And, they're mostly covered call options. So, the big difference with that is you're using that to dampen volatility. Create another stream of income or hedge against larger swings," said Arthur in the same segment.                                                                                                                                               , He believes it's key to have regulators enforce the disclosures in the products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "In the meantime, you just continue to do increased education alongside the regulation," noted Arthur. "You don't need a complex product to go broke day trading on Robinhood."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , If there's a broad federal crackdown, Dave Nadig, CIO and director of research at ETF Trends, warns it could have serious consequences for the industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "[It] could have a pretty chilling effect on the sales of those products and investor portfolios," Nadig said in the same segment.

"The unemployment rate dropped to 3.6% – edging closer to a pre-pandemic level of 3.5%.

The move comes as inflation recently hit its third consecutive 40-year high in February.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Now, as the employment market continues to recover, one economist says it will mean the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "Although mortgage rates have spiked more than half a percentage point over the past two weeks, reducing affordability for many potential first-time homebuyers, the increase in wages will certainly somewhat help offset that hurdle," Mortgage Bankers Association Senior Vice President and Chief Economist Mike Fratantoni said. "And the confidence that many potential homebuyers have in their financial situation also benefits from this historically strong job market. We continue to expect that the Federal Reserve will move rates up expeditiously to counter surging inflation and that this report only adds more urgency to their plans to do so.", If you are looking to take advantage of interest rates before they rise again, you could consider refinancing your mortgage to lower your monthly payment.

This change is also improving the job growth, Fratantoni says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Only 10% of workers reported teleworking due to the pandemic in March, down from 13% in February and less than half the level from its peak," he said. "As the federal government and others return to work in April, this number should drop sharply, which may well lead to further job changes in retail, professional services, and other sectors that are dependent on in-person work."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The strong jobs gains in March may likely be unstable, as some are based on temporary factors like a mass return-to-work. Fratantoni added that March’s job growth was "well-above what can be sustained for the longer term."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , If you are interested in taking advantage of interest rates today ahead of future rate hikes, consider taking out a personal loan to pay down high-interest debt.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Labor Secretary Marty Walsh ackowledges there is 'work to do' on the jobs front, but argues overall the March employment report was 'strong.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The March jobs report revealed another month of robust hiring, likely solidifying the case for the Federal Reserve to pivot toward a mega-sized interest rate hike as it seeks to cool red-hot inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday that payrolls in March rose by 431,000, slightly missing the 480,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists.

"With wage growth running so high, inflation fears are only heating up. A 50-basis point hike at the next meeting is surely secured. The only question that really remains is how many more half-point moves there will be this year."                             , The Fed voted in March to raise its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range between 0.25% and 0.5%.

"And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well.", A man wearing a mask walks past the U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington D.C., the United States, on April 29, 2020.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Inflation is hot just like the job market, but the March jobs report showed there aren’t a lot of jobs where wage growth is standing up to heated prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , That is, with some exceptions — which may hint a lot about where consumer demand is going as pandemic concerns fade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In a healthy-looking jobs report that showed the economy adding 431,000 jobs, the average hourly earnings increased to $31.73. That’s a 5.6% increase in average hourly earnings from the same point last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday                                                                                                                               , Make no mistake, a 5.6% increase is robust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In fact, workers need to look back to the early 1980s, apart from quick moments early in the pandemic, to find year-over-year increases that large. The hourly earnings growth was 0.4% from February to March.                                                                                                                                                                             , However, prices are increasing even faster, according to widely-watched inflation gauges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The Consumer Price Index reached 7.9% in February, and some economists worry it will go even higher in March numbers that will capture the ripple effects from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                , Another price gauge favored by the Federal Reserve, the personal consumption price index, reached 6.4% in February, according to data this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In that context, there are just a handful of sectors where, at least for the March jobs report, year-over-year wage growth is keeping pace with inflation:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , • In transportation and warehousing jobs, the year-over-year growth rate in hourly earnings was 7.9%. Paying an average hourly rate of $27.79, these workers have been much-needed with e-commerce sales booming and supply chains trying to unsnarl. March jobs for this sector were “essentially unchanged,” after big gains in February and January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said., • In leisure and hospitality jobs, the year-over-year growth was even higher, at 11.8%. Hotels, restaurants and bars kept staffing up, accounting for roughly one-quarter of all the March jobs gains and paying an average $19.68 an hour in March. The sector is still down 1.5 million workers from before the pandemic, labor department numbers noted.                                 , Apply the Fed-preferred measure on inflation, with its 6.4% read in February, and a couple other spots stand out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , • Jobs in retail trade saw 6.5% average hourly earnings growth, paying an average $22.89 per hour. This sector includes work in everything from grocery stores to gas stations, clothing, hardware and more. In March, retail trade employers hired on 49,000 more people.                                                                                                                  , • Jobs in “professional and business services” had a 6.6% increase, paying an average $38.18 an hour. In March, this sector — covering all sorts of white-collar work from accountants and lawyers to call centers and administrative staff — added 102,000 jobs.                                                                                                                           , “Jobs aside, the key number in this report is the modest 0.4% rebound in average hourly earnings, which rose by a mere 0.1% in February. One soft print, out of the blue, is easy to dismiss as noise, but two is harder to ignore; three would be definitive, so the April number is now hugely important,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note.   , In times of high inflation, the worry is that a nasty feedback loop  will develop, where high costs push wages higher, leading to even higher prices and higher wages in what’s called a “wage price spiral.”                                                                                                                                                                               , “Without sustained rapid wage growth, an inflation spike can’t become a spiral,” Shepherdson wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The latest report showed strong job growth, but there are downsides, and they will not be shouldered equally, according to Dawit Kebede, senior economist at the Credit Union National Association.                                                                                                                                                                                         , “Continued increase in wage growth will lead to more price increases as businesses transfer these costs to consumers. This impacts low-wage earners who are already struggling to make ends meet with price increases in broad consumer items.”                                                                                                                                             , “People are making more money, they’re finding better jobs and — after decades of being mistreated and paid too little — more and more American workers have real power now to get better wages and to do what’s best for themselves andtheir families,” President Joe Biden said Friday.                                                                                                   , His Republican critics note it’s not that simple, hammering on wages getting gnawed by inflation — and government policies that, they say, are part of the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Rep.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures post losses for the session and week - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures fell on Friday, contributing to a weekly loss of more than 1%, with prices pressured in part by strength in the U.S. dollar and a rise in 10-year Treasury yields in the wake of a sizable rise in March U.S. nonfarm payrolls. Still, Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth management, said it appears that falling commodity prices had a bigger impact on gold Friday, particularly with U.S. benchmark oil prices falling below $100 a barrel. "Gold has traditionally acted as a hedge against inflation and just as rising energy prices earlier this year gave gold a tailwind, falling energy prices may be presenting a near-term headwind."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> People have been warned to brace for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , This could add another £629 a year to a typical bill, on top of Friday's unprecedented £700-a-year rise, says energy consultancy Cornwall Insight.                                                                                                                                                                                 , The expected rise in bills just as colder weather kicks in has prompted calls for fresh government support to those struggling to pay.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Energy prices have been affected by the Ukraine war and pressure on suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The most up-to-date prediction from Cornwall Insight would, if accurate, push annual energy bills for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to up to £2,600 from October.                                                                                                                                      , A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating.                                                                                                                                                                                  , "We are going to see an extra £500 or £600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households," he told the BBC.                                                                                                                                                , "He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."                                                                                                                                                  , The warning comes on top of a huge rise in what energy suppliers can charge customers from Friday. The £693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year.                                                 , At the same time, a host of bill hikes take effect with council tax, water bills and car tax  going up for some on 1 April.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals.                                                                                                                                                                            , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , New official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                , The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s.                                                                                                                                                                                        , It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The cap, set every six months for England.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> U.S. House passes cannabis legalization measure for the second time - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act) by a vote of 220 to 204 mostly along partly lines. It's the second time the legislative body has approved the measure to legalize cannabis on the federal level after a vote in 2020. The measure is expected to meet the same fate as it did two years ago, namely it will not be taken up by the Senate. In both cases, the measure was sponsored by Jerrold Nadler, D., N.Y., who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In the latest ballot, three Republicans voted in favor of it and 217 Democrats, with 202 Republicans opposed to it, along with two Democrats. In terms of major moves from the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D, N.Y., later this month is expected to formally introduce the Cannabis Administration And Opportunity Act to remove cannabis from the federal list of controlled substances.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Ibex 35 closed 0.7% higher at 8,503 on the first trading session of April, bouncing off a 0.4% decline for the month of March, lifted by the financial and the pharmaceutical sectors as investors weighed on price data from the euro area. The inflation rate in the currency bloc rose to 7.5% for March, a new record high, surpassing expectations. Consequently, bets of accelerated monetary tightening by the ECB, lifted banks’ shares driven by Banco Santander (2.6%) and Caixabank (3.2%). Meanwhile, utilities Endesa (-0.8%) and Naturgy (-1.1%) pared their gains from the prior session. On the domestic front, Spain's factory activity growth slowed more than expected in March, as demand conditions weakened due to the uncertainty around the conflict in Ukraine.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The seasonally adjusted manufacturing confidence index in Mexico eased to 52.2 in March of 2022 from a downwardly revised 52.4 in the prior month, the lowest in five months. Respondents were broadly less keen to invest (40.8 vs 44.1 in February), and, to a much lesser extent, sentiment deteriorated regarding the country's future economic situation (54.7 vs 54.9) and the company’s future financial situation (59.5 vs 59.3). On the other hand, opinions about the company’s current financial situation were more optimistic (55.4 vs 54.4), as well as regarding the economic situation of the country in the present (50.3 vs 50.1). </td>

A handful of employees at Amazon’s massive warehouse on Staten Island, operating without support from national labor organizations, took on one of the most powerful companies in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , And, somehow, they won.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Workers at the facility voted by a wide margin to form a union, according to results released on Friday, in one of the biggest victories for organized labor in a generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Employees cast 2,654 votes to be represented by Amazon Labor Union and 2,131 against, giving the union a win by more than 10 percentage points, according to the National Labor Relations Board. More than 8,300 workers at the warehouse, which is the only Amazon fulfillment center in New York City, were eligible to vote.                                                                                                                                                                                   , The win on Staten Island comes at a perilous moment for labor unions in the United States, which saw the portion of workers in unions drop last year to 10.3 percent, the lowest rate in decades, despite high demand for workers, pockets of successful labor activity and rising public approval.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Critics — including some labor officials — say that traditional unions haven’t spent enough money or shown enough imagination in organizing campaigns and that they have often bet on the wrong fights. Some point to tawdry corruption scandals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The union victory at Amazon, the first at the company in the United States after years of worker activism there, offers an enormous opportunity to change that trajectory and build on recent wins. Many union leaders regard Amazon as an existential threat to labor standards because it touches so many industries and frequently dominates them.                                                                                                                                                             , But the win by a little-known, independent union with few ties to existing groups appears to raise as many questions for the labor movement as it answers: not least, whether there is something fundamentally broken with the traditional bureaucratic union model that can be solved only by replacing it with grass-roots organizations like the one on Staten Island.                                                                                                                                         , Amazon is likely to aggressively contest the union’s win. An unsigned statement on its corporate blog said, “We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The Staten Island outcome followed what appears likely to be a narrow loss by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union at a large Amazon warehouse in Alabama. The vote is close enough that the results will not be known for several weeks as contested ballots are litigated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The surprising strength shown by unions in both locations most likely means that Amazon will face years of pressure at other company facilities from labor groups and progressive activists working with them. As a recent string of union victories at Starbucks have shown, wins at one location can provide encouragement at others.                                                                                                                                                                           , Amazon hired voraciously over the past two years and now has 1.6 million employees globally. But it has been plagued by high turnover, and the pandemic gave employees a growing sense of power while fueling worries about workplace safety. The Staten Island warehouse, known as JFK8, was the subject of a New York Times investigation last year, which found that it was emblematic of the stresses — including inadvertent firings and sky-high attrition — on workers caused by Amazon’s employment model., “The pandemic has fundamentally changed the labor landscape” by giving workers more leverage with their employers, said John Logan, a professor of labor studies at San Francisco State University. “It’s just a question of whether unions can take advantage of the opportunity that transformation has opened up.”                                                                                                                                                                                             , Standing outside the N.L.R.B. office in Brooklyn, where the ballots were tallied, Christian Smalls, a former Amazon employee who started the union, popped a bottle of champagne before a crowd of supporters and press. “To the first Amazon union in American history,” he cheered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Amazon said it was evaluating its options, including potentially filing an objection to “inappropriate and undue influence” by the N.L.R.B. for suing Amazon in federal court last month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In that case, the N.L.R.B. asked a judge to force Amazon to swiftly rectify “flagrant unfair labor practices” it said took place when Amazon fired a worker who became involved with the union. Amazon argued in court that the labor board abandoned “the neutrality of their office” by filing the injunction just before the election.                                                                                                                                                                         , Amazon would need to prove that any claims of undue influence undermined the so-called laboratory conditions necessary for a fair election, said Wilma B. Liebman, the chair of the N.L.R.B. under President Barack Obama.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , President Biden was “glad to see workers ensure their voices are heard” at the Amazon facility, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters. “He believes firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The near-term question facing the labor movement and other progressive groups is the extent to which they will help the upstart Amazon Labor Union withstand potential challenges to the result and negotiate a first contract, such as by providing resources and legal talent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “The company will appeal, drag it out — it’s going to be an ongoing fight,” said Gene Bruskin, a longtime organizer who helped notch one of labor’s last victories on this scale, at a Smithfield meat-processing plant in 2008, and has informally advised the Staten Island workers. “The labor movement has to figure out how to support them.”                                                                                                                                                                , Sean O’Brien, the new president of the 1.3 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said in an interview on Thursday that the union was prepared to spend hundreds of millions of dollars unionizing Amazon and to collaborate with a variety of other unions and progressive groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “We’ve got a lot of partners in labor,” Mr. O’Brien said. “We’ve got community groups. It’s going to be a large coalition.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , A culture of fear created by intense productivity monitoring that was documented by The Times at JFK8 has been a key motivator for the unionization drive, which started in earnest almost a year ago. The Amazon facility offered a lifeline to laid-off workers during the pandemic but burned through staff and had such poor communication and technology that workers inadvertently were fired or lost benefits.                                                                                             , For some employees, the stress of working at the warehouse during Covid outbreaks was a radicalizing experience that led them to take action. Mr. Smalls, the president of the Amazon Labor Union, said he became alarmed in March 2020 after encountering a co-worker who was clearly ill. He pleaded with management to close the facility for two weeks. The company fired him after he helped lead a walkout over safety conditions in late March that year.                                                  , Amazon said at the time that it had taken “extreme measures” to keep workers safe, including deep cleaning and social distancing. It said it had fired Mr. Smalls for violating social distancing guidelines and attending the walkout even though he had been placed in a quarantine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After workers at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., overwhelmingly rejected the retail workers union in its first election last spring, Mr. Smalls and Derrick Palmer, an Amazon employee who is his friend, decided to form a new union, called Amazon Labor Union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , While the organizing in Alabama included high-profile tactics, with progressive supporters like Senator Bernie Sanders visiting the area, the organizers at JFK8 benefited from being insiders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , For months, they set up shop at the bus stop outside the warehouse, grilling meat at barbecues and at one point even passing out pot.  (The retail workers said they were hamstrung by Covid during their initial election in Alabama.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , They also filed numerous unfair-labor-practice charges with the N.L.R.B. when they believed Amazon had infringed on their rights. The labor agency found merit in several of the cases, some of which Amazon settled in a nationwide agreement to allow workers more access to organize on-site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , At times the Amazon Labor Union stumbled. The labor board determined this fall that the fledgling union, which spent months collecting signatures from workers requesting a vote, had not demonstrated sufficient support to warrant an election. But the organizers kept trying, and by late January they had finally gathered enough signatures.                                                                                                                                                                , Amazon played up its minimum wage of $15 an hour in advertising and other public relations efforts. The company also waged a full-throated campaign against the union, texting employees and mandating attendance at anti-union meetings. It spent $4.3 million on anti-union consultants nationwide last year, according to annual disclosures filed on Thursday with the Labor Department.                                                                                                                      , In February, Mr. Smalls was arrested at the facility after managers said he was trespassing while delivering food to co-workers and called the police. Two current employees were also arrested during the incident, which appeared to galvanize interest in the union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The difference in outcomes in Bessemer and Staten Island may reflect a difference in receptiveness toward unions in the two states — roughly 6 percent of workers in Alabama are union members, versus 22 percent in New York — as well as the difference between a mail-in election and one conducted in person.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But it may also suggest the advantages of organizing through an independent, worker-led union. In Alabama, union officials and professional organizers were still barred from the facility under the settlement with the labor board. But at the Staten Island site, a larger portion of the union leadership and organizers were current employees.                                                                                                                                                              , “What we were trying to say all along is that having workers on the inside is the most powerful tool,” said Mr. Palmer, who makes $21.50 an hour. “People didn’t believe it, but you can’t beat workers organizing other workers.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The independence of the Amazon Labor Union also appeared to undermine Amazon’s anti-union talking points, which cast the union as an interloping “third party.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , On March 25, workers at JFK8 started lining up outside a tent in the parking lot to vote.

The unemployment rate, which is calculated based on a separate survey, fell to 3.6%, the lowest level since February 2020.                                                                         , Job gains were broad-based, with the biggest increases in leisure and hospitality (112,000), professional and business services (102,000) and retail (49,000).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , THESE STATES ROLLED BACK THEIR GASOLINE TAXES.

Biden announced this week that the U.S. will release up to 180 million barrels of oil from a strategic reserve to lessen the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on energy prices. , "Nations are coming together to deny Putin the ability to weaponize his energy resources against American families, not only American families but families in Europe and around the world," Biden added. </td>

At present it is about six times higher than it was a year ago.                                    , One reason is the surge in demand for energy, as businesses and economies get going again after the lifting of Covid restrictions. There is also the ongoing issue of a shortage of gas storage across Europe., A further rise in the price cap - predicted to push up the typical household energy bill by another £600 a year - is expected in October.                                                                     , This is mainly because of the potential restriction of Russian gas supplies - linked to the war in Ukraine.                                                                                                   , While we get very little gas from Russia in the UK, we are affected by the global price of gas.                                                                                                               , Can people forced to work from home ask employers to contribute to energy bills? - Andrew Green                                                                                                               , There is nothing to stop you asking. What response you get from your employer is down to them.                                                                                                                , Some employers have offered temporary grants and payments, to help their staff pay their energy bills.                                                                                                        , Unions and employees themselves are likely to point to the rising cost of living - including higher energy bills - to ask for higher salaries.                                                                , Will giving up Netflix, Amazon Prime, alcohol and mobile phones offset the rising cost? - Leslie Cox                                                                                                          , The average UK household spends about £916 on alcohol each year.                                                                                                                                              , The cheapest Netflix plan costs £84 a year, while Amazon Prime costs £96.                                                                                                                                     , Some mobile phone deals exceed £80 a month but, depending on your contract, you may be able to switch to a SIM-only deal for as little as £36 a year.                                                         , Giving up all of these costs could save between £1,132 and £2,056 a year.                                                                                                                                     , A 54% rise in the energy price cap means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will now pay £1,971 per year.                                                                              , So, going without could make a difference.                                                                                                                                                                    , But even then, a further rise pushing the annual bill up to £2,600 should be expected in October, analysts have told the BBC.                                                                                 , How is the assistance provided going to help pensioners who have been robbed of a triple-lock increase? Dave                                                                                                  , The triple-lock, a policy used to set the rise in state pensions, was suspended last year because it followed the average rise in wages and would have meant an increase of 8%.                               , At the time that seemed like a big increase, but inflation is now 6.2%.                                                                                                                                       , Instead of the state pension going up by 8%, it's going up by 3.1% - based on the rate of inflation in September last year, which is a much smaller pay rise for state pensioners.                            , Changes announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Spring Statement were mostly aimed at working people who pay National Insurance. There has not been any specific new support for pensioners.               , Why have tariffs on 100% renewable electricity gone up? - Karl Oldham                                                                                                                                         , Eco providers are still affected by wholesale prices, which are driving bill rises.                                                                                                                           , These providers try to buy in advance from renewable sources, and invest in schemes for renewable generation.                                                                                                 , But ultimately, at present, they have to source electricity from the National Grid - some of which is generated from gas.                                                                                     , As a result, they are not immune to the situation in the wider market, and prices charged by renewable generators have been going up too.                                                                     , Romesh Ranganathan investigates the musician's death                                                                                                                                                          , Robert Plant on how he felt about fronting Led Zeppelin                                                                                                                                                       , Watch all four series of The Bridge on iPlayer                                                                                                                                                                , © 2022 BBC.

The latest employment report showed US employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, but the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6% and wages growth accelerated again. Meanwhile, March manufacturing data from ISM came below expectations. A tighter job market and soaring inflation are paving the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points in May. Industrial and technology shares underperformed in afternoon trading, while energy stocks were trading higher.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The ranks of the long-term unemployed fell again in March, edging closer to prepandemic levels as the job market offers ample opportunity for workers.                                                                                                                                                                               , Long-term unemployment is a period of joblessness that lasts 27 weeks or more (or, at least six months). It's generally a financially precarious period for households in which it's harder to find a job and unemployment benefits are unavailable.                                                                                 , The number of long-term unemployed declined by 274,000 in March, to 1.4 million, according to the Labor Department's monthly jobs report issued Friday.                                                                                                                                                                              , In March 2021, the long-term jobless accounted for 43.2% of all unemployed individuals, a pandemic-era high and just shy of the all-time record 45.5%, which was set in April 2010 in the wake of the Great Recession.                                                                                                               , By March 2022, the share had nearly halved to 23.9% and was approaching its prepandemic level of roughly 19% to 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The improvement comes amid a labor market that has been particularly strong for workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Job openings (an indicator of employer demand for workers) are near record highs and layoffs near record lows as businesses aim to hold onto the workers they have.                                                                                                                                                                  , Annual wage growth is higher than at any point in over 20 years, according to economists at job site Indeed.

That's almost exactly the same pace as average monthly job creation in 2021, according to Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and former chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration.                      , If the pace continues, the economy will recover all its lost pandemic-era jobs (22 million total) in June, Zhao said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "It's remarkable how quickly the economy has recovered given how deep the crisis was," Zhao said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , It's unclear how long the worker-friendly labor market will persist.

The annual inflation rate in the Euro Area surged to an all-time high of 7.5% in March of 2022 well above market forecasts of 6.6%.

The latest reading pointed to the 25th consecutive month of contraction in factory activity amid further declines in production, sales, and employment. On the price front, inputs costs rose at the second-sharpest rate since the series began in 2012 amid persistent supply bottlenecks on the heels of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Firms continued to pass additional cost burdens to clients, with output charges increasing to their highest since August 2018.

Also, Eurozone and Germany’s final PMI readings came lower than preliminary estimates at 14 and 18-month low, respectively.

It was above the neutral 50.0 threshold for the ninth straight month, indicating an overall improvement in operating conditions. Output expanded at a stronger rate amid higher sales, strengthening demand conditions and improved client confidence. Similarly, factory orders expanded at the quickest rate in the year-to-date, owing to new bid awards, new client wins, the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improved demand. However, staff shortages, raw material scarcity and inflationary pressures restricted the expansions in production and sales. Employment rose, reflecting sustained increases in sales. On the price front,Input costs rose sharply again, with companies transferring part of this to consumers via hikes to output charges. Finally, business optimism weakened due to election, inflation and supply-chain concerns. </td>

There's also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in the Donbas area."                                                                                                                                                   , And later that same day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned citizens of tough times ahead in the east, saying that in "Donbas, Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful blows. We will defend ourselves."                                                                                                                     , "The situation in the southern direction and in the Donbas remains extremely difficult," Zelensky added. It was the second time in 24 hours he had warned of an expanding Russian offensive in Donbas.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also expects Donbas to become pivotal. "Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region," he said Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , An analysis of what's happening on the ground in eastern Ukraine supports this view, with Russian armor and artillery intensifying their attacks, and yet more Ukrainian civilians fleeing westwards. The Russian offensive is being conducted in several directions simultaneously.                                                                                                                    , Back to basics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , When Putin announced the invasion on February 24, he claimed the goal of Russia's so-called "special military operation" was the liberation of Donbas from neo-Nazis and the protection of its people from alleged "genocide" by the Ukrainian authorities.                                                                                                                                             , The Russian campaign since has been a smorgasbord of operations that have included a stuttering ground offensive and hugely destructive missile and artillery fire, and its ultimate goals are still difficult to divine. But the focus of Russia's military effort -- and rhetoric -- has recently shifted to the south and east of Ukraine.                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Russian Defense Ministry's daily summaries have sought to focus on successes in these regions and, over the past week, various Russian officials have described the Donbas as the main goal of the operation, with other actions merely designed to pin down Ukrainian troops.                                                                                                                      , On Wednesday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces were regrouping in order to "intensify operations in priority areas and, above all, to finish the operation for the complete liberation of Donbas."                                                                                                                                                  , At the same time, Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said the goal of the campaign was to secure all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Prior to the offensive, the separatist "People's Republics" controlled about one-third of the two regions.                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Gaining an accurate picture of the battlefield in the east is at best difficult -- but Russia and its allies in Luhansk and Donetsk are pounding Ukrainian-held towns and cities and edging forward. And yet they are still encountering stiff resistance from some of Ukraine's best units, more than a month after the invasion began.                                                                , The devastation of the southeastern city of Mariupol, where an estimated 90% of buildings have been damaged in a month of fighting, is well known. It has been described as the new Aleppo, a reference to the Syrian city devastated by a Russian-backed siege in 2016.                                                                                                                                , Much of Mariupol is now under Russian control, but its defenders are still tying down significant Russian and Chechen forces and inflicting heavy casualties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Russians claim progress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mariupol's horrors are not unique. Further north, cities like Izium, Rubizhne and Severodonetsk have also suffered widespread damage in weeks of fighting. Most are without power and water.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Ukrainian troops are clinging on in Rubizhne and Severodonetsk, even if they are depopulated ruins, surrounded and bombarded daily. But on Friday the Ukrainian General Staff confirmed that Izium had fallen to the Russians after weeks of fighting.                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Ukrainian forces are now trying to prevent the Russians from pushing further south towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, which were briefly held by pro-Russian separatists in 2014 and would be significant gains.                                                                                                                                                                           , Ukrainian officials in the Donetsk region have this week reported Russian shelling and airstrikes along the entire "line of contact" which divided separatist-held areas from the rest of Ukraine before the Russian invasion. But that line is now history as Russian forces push beyond.                                                                                                              , According to Moscow's version of events, Russian forces are winning territory as they push westwards towards the regional borders. On Thursday, the Ministry of Defense said Russian troops had advanced 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) in a day and now hold the town of Zolotaya Niva. If true, that would put the Russians just 15 miles (25 km) from Donetsk's regional border.                           , It's also become clear that the Russians are trying to cut the Ukrainians' fuel supplies: they hit another fuel dump near Dnipro on Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Ukrainian military insists that it is repelling Russian assaults throughout the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Serhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk regional military administration, said Friday that Ukrainian forces had fought off attempts by Russian forces to bypass their positions west of the city of Luhansk.                                                                                , But the daily evacuation of civilians from towns such as Rubizhne, Bakhmut and Popasna suggests that Ukrainian forces are on the backfoot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "We organize trains and buses to save as many lives of Ukrainians, residents of Luhansk region, as we can," Haidai said Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But so far, he confirmed Friday, just 18,000 people have been evacuated from Luhansk, leaving hundreds of thousands enduring daily bombardment with scarce access to water and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Rapid gains 'unlikely'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The danger for Ukrainian troops in this area is that they could get caught between Russian forces advancing from the east and other units that have pushed up -- with varying degrees of success -- from Crimea to the south.                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , If the Russians reach the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk, they might even push onwards to the more defensible River Dnieper, on which the major cities of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro sit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But the performance of Russian ground forces in this conflict so far suggests they have a lot to do to secure both eastern provinces. The Institute for the Study of War, in its latest assessment, said that "Russian force generation efforts and the redeployment of damaged units from the Kyiv axis are increasingly unlikely to enable Russian forces to make rapid gains in the Donbas region."  , And Brian Mikalovsky, writing in Foreign Affairs, said the Russians' "northern and southern invasion forces still have several lines of Ukrainian defenses and a few hundred kilometers of territory to cross before they can unite, and the [Ukrainian] army is fighting hard to prevent Russia from succeeding."                                                                                      , Mikalovsky, who lived in Severodonetsk until January, added: "Dogged Ukrainian soldiers have torched multiple tank columns at the entrances to Severodonetsk. Russian forces moved into Rubizhne, but they have taken heavy casualties and have been able to seize just half of the city."                                                                                                              , Even if the Russians succeed in grinding down the resistance in these eastern cities and towns, and give the Kremlin a way to declare victory, they will bequeath themselves a wasteland of destruction that will likely take decades and tens of billions of dollars to repair.                                                                                                                        , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago wheat futures fell below $10 per bushel at the beginning of April, the lowest in one month, on expectations of higher production in Asia and North America. Higher wheat prices amid the war in Ukraine may allow Indian wheat to tap into new markets. Healthy harvests and improved transportation infrastructure in India, the world’s second-largest producer, could lead to record wheat exports in the coming year. Indian exports are expected to reach 7 million tonnes in the 2022 financial year and forecasts for 2023 range up to 21 million tonnes, according to the agricultural division of ITC. Meanwhile, rainfall in dry regions of the US plains and Europe may lead to higher crops in the northern hemisphere. Still, the wheat prices remain 20% above their February levels as the war in Ukraine has disrupted shipping from the Black Sea region, and production in Ukraine is set to decline. Ukraine was the world's sixth-largest exporter of wheat in 2021 with a 10% share of the market. </td>

In Q3 2021, Gazprom, which is Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas, relied on the euro for roughly 59% of foreign sales. Support also came from forecasts of below-average temperatures in northwest Europe, which should add pressure on utilities' inventory replenishing efforts, and reports that unplanned outages at Norwegian gas fields continued to affect output.

Progress was made to solve the labor shortage problems at all tiers of the supply chain, which will result in improved factory throughput and supplier deliveries. Panel sentiment remained strongly optimistic regarding demand", Timothy Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee said. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P Global US Manufacturing PMI was revised slightly higher to 58.8 in March of 2022 from a preliminary of 58.5, pointing to the strongest growth in factory activity in six months, amid faster increases in output and new orders, as domestic and foreign client demand ticked higher. Although backlogs of work rose at a sharper pace firms noted that fewer supply bottlenecks allowed production to expand at a faster rate. Moreover, supplier delivery times deteriorated to the smallest extent since January 2021. Nonetheless, costs continued to soar, as the rate of input price inflation quickened to a marked pace. Encouraged by stronger demand conditions, firms stepped up their hiring activity, with some also noting a greater ability to find suitable candidates. Meanwhile, expectations regarding the outlook for output reached the highest since November 2020. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P Global Brazil Manufacturing PMI rose to 52.3 in March of 2022, from 49.6 in the previous month. The latest reading pointed to the first expansion in factory activity since October last year, with manufacturers reporting a rebound in production and new orders while employment expanded. Furthermore, hiring activity and restocking efforts were resumed. On the price front, input costs rose at the sharpest rate in 2022, while output charges rose to a seven-month high. Finally, businesses were less upbeat about growth prospects as optimism was clouded by supply chains bottlenecks, Russia's war against Ukraine and inflationary pressures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing PMI rose to a fresh all-time high of 58.9 in March of 2022, from 56.6 in February, the 21st month in a row with the reading above the 50 threshold. Output, new orders, and employment rose faster, as good producers faced the strongest demand in a year, amid a combination of the lifting of COVID-19 rules, and concerns over both shortages and further price hikes. Also, the aforementioned issues, coupled with delivery delays prompted good producers to expand pre-production inventories at a record pace. Meanwhile, soaring transportation, metal, and fuel prices, as well as input shortages drove costs at an unprecedented rate, which also reflected in a record-breaking inflation rate for selling charges. Finally, manufacturers were more optimistic because of the further easing of restrictions and expectations of a return to normality. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the French 10-year OAT rose past 1%, hovering around 5-year highs as the worldwide bond selloff continued amid bets of accelerated monetary policy tightening by major central banks. Consumer inflation in the Eurozone came at a record-high 7.5% in March, well above expectations, moving money markets to expect four 25bps rate hikes by the ECB until year-end, according to Bloomberg. To add, unemployment levels remained at all-time lows in the currency bloc. In the meantime, Federal Reserve policymakers expressed support of a 50bps hike in the Funds rate in May, accelerating from expectations since the start of the tightening cycle in March. Investors now await the 1st round of French presidential elections on April 10th, in which centrist incumbent Emanuel Macron leads the polls ahead of right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen. </td>

When you add the revisions, a half a million job creation is a very, very strong number. But I really see this as a kind of a weird kind of tale of two economies. You've got an incredibly strong job market and an incredibly high inflation rate. And here's the problem going forward that I worry about-- something's got to give here. You know, you can't continue to have inflation at 8% and wages growing at 5.5%. That doesn't work, right? Because that means that workers continue to fall behind. And the problem is, if those wages start to catch up with the inflation rate, then you get this kind of wage-price spiral that can be, you know, so damaging. We've got to bring this inflation rate down to maintain a healthy economy. I talked to a CEO in Silicon Valley a couple of days ago, saying to get a qualified engineer in Silicon Valley now wages $500,000 -- for an engineer -- those are incredibly high salaries. So there is a shortage of talent. But the key for the Biden administration and the Fed is to bring this inflation down as rapidly as possible. , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , WATCH THE FULL MARCH JOBS REPORT HERE:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , FOX Business' Cheryl Casone reports on the March employment report moments after its release. </td>

But surging inflation – which hit a fresh 40-year high in February– has erased those would-be gains for workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , By that measure, the typical U.S. worker is actually worse off today than they were a year ago, even though nominal wages are rising at the fastest pace in years. That's because inflation is also soaring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , US ECONOMY FACING 'A LOT OF CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW': LABOR SECRETARY MARTY WALSH                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Zandi noted that "wage growth is strong" and it was "more desirable that inflation comes back in than wage growth accelerate."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi warned shortly after the release of the March jobs report that wage growth is "strong," but inflation is "stronger," which is "not desirable."

Gas jumped 6.6% and accounted for almost a third of price hikes. Grocery costs jumped 1.4%, the sharpest one-month increase since 1990, other than during a pandemic-induced price surge two years ago. The cost of fruits and vegetables rose 2.3%, the largest monthly increase since 2010.                                                                                                   , For the 12 months ending in February, grocery prices jumped 8.6%, the biggest year-over-year increase since 1981, the government said. Gas prices are up a whopping 38%.

The survey also revealed that less than a quarter of the organizations surveyed are making changes to their salary budgets because of price hikes, even though 43% of the employers said that workers have been asking them to increase wages to help with rising costs. , The vast majority, 77%, of employers surveyed said dissatisfaction with pay or the ability to get a higher salary at another company were top reasons for turnover, according to the survey. Mercer also found that half of those surveyed said they will conduct additional salary reviews for some or all of their employees in response to surging inflation, an indicator that some employers may be getting worried about losing workers if they don’t make changes.          , Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi provides insight into inflation and government spending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "We have seen a lot of companies raise pay," Zandi noted, adding that data in the March jobs report reflected that point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , He said it's "not surprising" that employers are trying to manage the situation "without raising wages too much because if they do, that cuts into their margins and earnings and they have to try to pass that in the form of higher inflation."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "We don’t want to see a wage-price spiral develop because if that happens, the risk of recession will be even greater," Zandi warned, noting that that would result in the Fed having to "step on the breaks even harder to break that cycle."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Zandi believes it would be "most constructive" for employers to focus on "improving the labor productivity of their workforce" as a way to address the current economic situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , He explained that that would include investing in technology, equipment and software, among other things, to "make their workforce more productive" and then companies can pay their employees more while still maintaining their earnings and profit growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Goldman Sachs is betting that you’ll want a $10,000 home improvement loan from the investment bank </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Goldman Sachs, the 153-year old investment bank, is now officially in the home improvement loan business as it continues a push into the finances of ordinary Americans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The bank expects to add one million customers a year to its budding Marcus retail division through the acquisition of GreenSky, announced in September at a $2.2 billion price tag, Goldman executives said in their first interview after the deal closed Tuesday. GreenSky is an Atlanta-based buy-now, pay-later fintech firm that focuses on construction loans with an average $10,000 size.                                                   , "It a great acquisition engine because we expect to bring a million new customers annually through this distribution we're adding to the Marcus ecosystem," said Swati Bhatia, a Goldman partner and former Stripe executive. These customers will be able to use the firm's Marcus app, where they will be offered the bank's other products, including savings, personal loans and an expected digital checking account later this year, she said., The move has broad implications for Goldman investors as it ramps up its ambitions in consumer finance, bringing increased opportunities — and risk. Goldman will start originating GreenSky's loans using its own $1.5 trillion balance sheet in the next few months, according to Bhatia, replacing the bank partners GreenSky had leaned on when it was independent.                                                                             , That will add potentially billions of dollars of new loans onto its balance sheet, which should serve as an engine for generating the type of interest income that powers larger retail rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , As a result, Goldman — which typically touts it ability to manage risk as it added products like the Apple Card to its portfolio — will be more exposed to the creditworthiness of ordinary Americans. While GreenSky naturally caters to homeowners, the loans are unsecured, meaning customers' houses aren't used as collateral if the borrower falls behind.                                                                                    , GreenSky had been originating roughly $7 billion in loans a year before it was acquired, although Goldman may choose to securitize some of the loans, depending on market conditions, Bhatia said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Thanks to a shortage of new construction homes and remote-work trends accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, demand for home improvement loans has been robust, according to GreenSky founder David Zalik, who is joining Goldman at the partner level.                                                                                                                                                                                           , "It's amazing how resilient that business is, even with a pandemic, with supply chain challenges, rising interest rates; the demand has been tremendous," Zalik said. "There was two months in the pandemic where we didn't grow, and then it went through the roof. People want to invest in their homes."                                                                                                                                         , Customers typically come to GreenSky through the fintech's network of 10,000 merchants, which range from small businesses to some of the biggest U.S. home improvement brands. Users choose the length of repayment periods that may vary from 36 to 84 months and can repay loans early "at any time," according to Zalik.                                                                                                                         , "The consumer appreciates that if the total project is $15,000, I can buy it for $90 a month at a low single-digit interest rate," Zalik said. "It helps the consumer afford and manage their cash and helps the business sell their product, no different than Toyota sells a lot more cars because financing is available."                                                                                                                       , The integration of GreenSky systems into Goldman will take through the rest of the year and possibly into 2023, Bhatia said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the benchmark Japan 10-year JGB bounced back to 0.23% amid some profit taking, after a massive government bond purchase by the Bank of Japan caused yields to drop more than 3 basis points earlier this week. The combined purchase of 3-10 year JGB amounted to more than 2 trillion yen, in addition to separate offers for unlimited purchases of 10-year JGBs at a fixed rate of 0.25%, the ceiling of the central bank’s target. Meanwhile, Japan’s manufacturing PMI increased by 1.4 points to 54.7 in March, underpinned by a rebound in output and stronger demand, which marked the 14th straight month of expansion in the sector. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK Stocks Edge Up on Friday </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 edged higher on Friday, the first trading session of Q2 and after closing the 1st quarter 1.8% higher, outperforming its European peers largely thanks to its heavier presence of commodity and energy-related stocks, which have been benefiting from soaring oil and metal global prices amid the war in Ukraine. As for this session, market sentiment remained slightly bullish, as traders digested a lower-than-expected PMI reading for the UK’s manufacturing sector in March. Across sectors, losses in pharma stocks partly offset gains in consumer staples, like Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, and financial stocks. Barclays added 0.6% after a London court blocked a multi-billion pound claim filed by thousands of asset managers, pension funds, and other financial institutions against major banks. Elsewhere, a US jobs report showed employment rose less than expected in March. On a weekly basis, the index eyes a 0.6% gain. </td>

Students from families that received jobless benefits in 2020 — particularly if the family filed a tax return early in 2021 — may want to check with college financial aid offices to make sure they are getting the maximum amount.                                                                                   , Here’s what to know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , To qualify for financial aid, students and their families fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA. The form is the portal to federal need-based Pell grants and student loans, and states and colleges use it to award their own aid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The FAFSA for the 2022-23 academic year became available on Oct. 1 and uses financial information from the 2020 tax year, which is typically reported on tax returns filed in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Normally, unemployment benefits count as income when calculating a student’s eligibility for financial aid. But as part of its pandemic relief effort, the federal government allowed Americans earning less than $150,000 to exclude jobless benefits of up to $10,200 per recipient from their 2020 taxable income. The measure took effect on March 11, 2021 — after many people had already filed their 2020 tax returns and reported their jobless benefits as income.                   , The Internal Revenue Service said it would automatically make corrections for people who had already filed tax returns and send refunds if necessary. But the potential for confusion on the FAFSA lingers, especially for early tax filers who also use the I.R.S. Data Retrieval Tool to complete the form.                                                                                                                                                                                 , The tool lets FAFSA filers quickly transfer encrypted tax information into the online financial aid form, and the Federal Student Aid office encourages students and families to use it. But the tool transfers information from the original returns. So the data for early filers who didn’t claim the unemployment exemption won’t reflect the lower, I.R.S.-corrected income, said Kalman A. Chany, president of Campus Consultants, a financial aid advisory firm in Manhattan.          , In a notice posted online in the fall, the Federal Student Aid office said early tax filers who used the data tool for the FAFSA would have a higher reported income, “which may potentially reduce their eligibility for federal need-based aid.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , And, according to the notice, even people who filed their tax returns after March 11, 2021, and excluded jobless benefits from their income may still have reported their unemployment benefits as “untaxed income” on the FAFSA — which could also reduce potential aid. (Those affected are most likely applicants who filed their FAFSA in early October, before the Education Department clarified that the benefits shouldn’t be reported as untaxed income on the form, Mr. Chany said.), In an “alert” updated on Feb. 24, the I.R.S. warns FAFSA filers not to use the data tool if they filed their 2020 tax return and didn’t exclude any jobless benefits from their income.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “The concern is: Are colleges looking at inflated income?” said Brendan Williams, senior director of consulting at uAspire, a nonprofit organization that seeks to reduce financial barriers to college.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , It’s unclear how many students may be affected. Millions of people received jobless benefits in 2020, but data isn’t readily available to calculate how many of them are also filing a FAFSA, said Kim Cook, chief executive of the National College Attainment Network, a nonprofit group that works on behalf of low-income and minority students.                                                                                                                                          , The Federal Student Aid office has instructed college financial aid administrators to fix the problem if they become aware of it. But administrators may not be able to easily identify affected applications because they don’t typically see a breakdown of a family’s income, said Karen McCarthy, vice president of public policy and federal relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.                                                              , Students may be unaware of the issue and won’t know to ask about it, Mr. Chany said. “No one is tapping them on the shoulder,” he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , What should families do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , If they had unemployment income in 2020 and filed their tax return before March 11 last year, they should contact their college financial aid office to discuss their concerns and have the jobless benefits removed from income on the FAFSA, said Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert. Documents like Form 1099-G, which the government uses to report unemployment income, or unemployment verification letters can help show that students or their family received jobless benefits. , Students should also know that the federal government has encouraged college financial aid offices to use their discretion — “professional judgment” in financial aid lingo — to take into account special circumstances, including the loss of a job in the pandemic, to maximize a student’s financial aid.                                                                                                                                                                                 , It’s also possible in some cases, Ms. Cook said, that a family’s income may have been higher in 2020 than it is now because of expanded jobless benefits during the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Students or families that received unemployment benefits in 2020 “may be surprised” to see Pell grants that are “much lower” than in previous years, according to a report from Bottom Line, a nonprofit group that helps low-income and first-generation students attend college, and SwiftStudent, a nonprofit that provides free tools to help students file financial aid appeals.                                                                                                        , “It’s not your imagination,” the report said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Regardless of the reason, students should let financial aid offices know if their circumstances have changed. “If information on the FAFSA doesn’t accurately reflect your current situation, reach out to your school,” Ms. McCarthy said — the sooner, the better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Here are some questions and answers about the FAFSA and college aid:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , It could be significant, Mr. Kantrowitz said. A $10,000 reduction in income on the FAFSA can mean a reduction of $3,000 to $5,000 in a student’s expected financial contribution. It could also increase eligibility for need-based financial aid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , No. It’s always best to file the form as soon as possible after it becomes available each year because states and colleges have varying priority deadlines. But the final deadline to file a FAFSA for the next academic year is June 30, 2023. (Students can file the form to seek federal aid retroactively, but it generally must be filed and processed by the last day of their academic term, or June 30 — whichever comes first.)                                                      , The current pause on federal loan payments is scheduled to lift on May 1. It is unclear if President Biden may extend the freeze again, as he last did in December.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Russia accused Ukraine of mounting a helicopter attack on a fuel depot inside Russian territory Friday, as footage surfaced of the facility engulfed in flames.                                                                                                                                                 , In a statement, Russia's Ministry of Defense said that the helicopters "entered the airspace of the Russian Federation at extremely low altitude," at 5 a.m. Moscow time and "launched a missile attack on a civilian oil storage facility located on the outskirts of Belgorod."                                     , As a result, "individual tanks were damaged and caught fire," spokesperson Maj.

Residents in the vicinity of the depot were being evacuated but there was no threat to the population of the city, he added.     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Russian President Vladimir Putin has been informed about the alleged strike, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday, warning that the incident could hinder ongoing negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.                                                                                                        , "The president was informed about Belgorod," Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. "You know that the ministry of emergency situations was sent there. Steps are being taken to reorganize fuel supply points so that what happened in no case affects the level of supply of all necessary types of fuel.", The Russian military has claimed air superiority over Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "Air superiority during an operation is an absolute fact," Peskov said. "And as for what happened, it probably should not be us giving out assessments, but our law enforcement agencies."                                                                                                                            , CNN's Gianluca Mezzofiore, Katie Polglase and Celine Alkhaldi contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to as high as 2.44%, approaching an almost three-year high of 2.56% hit earlier this week, as markets anticipate an aggressive looming policy tightening cycle amid a tightening job market and runaway inflation. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed US employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, but the US jobless rate fell more than expected, and average hourly earnings grew at a more robust pace than in February. As a result, Treasury yields inverted again on Friday with the 2-year yield briefly exceeding the 10-year yield and reinforcing the view that Federal Reserve rate increases may cause a recession. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold declined to $1,930 an ounce on Friday and was headed for an over 1% weekly loss, after the latest US jobs report continued to show signs of a tight labour market strengthening expectations for a 50bps increase in the Fed funds rate in May to tame inflation. The American economy added 431 thousand jobs in March, a tad below market expectations, bringing the unemployment rate to a new pre-pandemic low of 3.6%. On Thursday, the metal capped its biggest quarterly gain since the pandemic-led surge in mid-2020 as concerns over soaring consumer prices and the Ukraine crisis boosted its safe-haven appeal. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures rose slightly on Friday tracking the broader market as investors reassessed the outlook of tightening monetary policy from the Fed while watching developments in the Russia-Ukraine war. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed US employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, but the unemployment rate fell again. Data poting to a tightening job market came on the heels of soaring inflation, currently at 40-year highs, which, in turn, prompted bets on a higher possibility of a 50-bps hike in May. On Thursday, the Dow fell 1.56%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.57%, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.54%. All three major averages posted their worst quarter since March 2020 with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 falling 4.6% and 4.9%, respectively, and the Nasdaq dropping more than 9%. </td>

March nonfarm payrolls missed expectations, but the jobless rate fell more than expected and average hourly earnings grew at a stronger pace than in February. Earlier this week, the data showed core PCE prices, the preferred gauge of inflation by the central bank, rose at the fastest rate in nearly four decades in February. The greenback also benefited from safe-haven flows as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine appeared to have stalled. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the Italian 10-year BTP rebounded to 2.1%, hovering around 23-month highs after soaring preliminary price data from the Eurozone strengthened expectations of an accelerated monetary tightening cycle by the ECB. Higher energy and commodity prices led inflation in the currency bloc to rise to a record-high 7.5%, well above expectations. According to Bloomberg, money markets moved to priced four quarter-point hikes in 2022, compared with expectations of two hikes at the same caliber. Meanwhile, domestic inflation likely surged to 6.7% in March. Surging energy and commodity prices have led the Italian government to slash its 2022 growth forecasts to 2.8% from 4.7% and heavily subsidize energy bills. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Not a bad day! Sadly, I revenge traded with the challenge account today and broke my own rule, so I will reset it next week. I knew better but it happens. Will follow my strict rules and quick cuts. 

I had a $AMC play at 9:37 for a Calls scalp that didn’t fill, and ran 30% on those green candles.. it settled and I got filled at 9:45 but the candle was a dud.  Normally I’d cut but with it being AMC and the challenge account still being small, I decided to hold. Whoops. Loss is a loss.

Made some great scalps on $SPY during regular trading on Live, and on AMC with the main account.

Set a record attendance for the Live trading stream 2 days in a row, really appreciate all of you who joined the team recently!! </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY If you aren&amp;#39;t watching the transports sector, you should. Days ago the WSJ and others put out articles like this: 
 
https://www.wsj.com/articles/transport-stocks-are-flashing-bullish-signals-for-broader-market-11648393780?mod=rss_markets_main 
 
Today the Dow Jones Transport index ($DJT) fell nearly 5%. The Department of Labor reported today that the number of truck transportation jobs fell in March after 21 consecutive monthly gains. 
 
Stocks like $FDX, $UPS, $XPO and railway stocks like UNP and CSX all tanked, along with the broader XTN ETF. 
 
The narrative has been &amp;quot;Increasing transport costs were part of the supply chain woes creating inflation etc. this is bad&amp;quot; 
 
Now it&amp;#39;s shifted to &amp;quot;declining freight costs signaling peak demand/growth, perhaps recession etc. this is also bad&amp;quot; 🙄  
 
If inflation is the problem, transport costs rolling over should be good news. This suggests inflation fears are yesterday&amp;#39;s worry and the real concern now is slowing demand/deflation. 
 
Maybe next week the street will have their narrative together. </td>

Writing on social media, Mr Medvedev said he wanted to outline &amp;quot;some simple but important points about food security in Russia&amp;quot; in the wake of sanctions.

He continued: &amp;quot;We will only be supplying food and agriculture products to our friends.

&amp;quot;Fortunately we have plenty of them, and they are not in Europe or North America at all.&amp;quot;

Russia primarily supplies wheat to Africa and the Middle East, with the EU and Ukraine being its main competitors.&amp;quot;

However, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly two-thirds of global wheat exports between them.

We must ALWAYS determine the market sentiment and BIAS for that day based on the news and headlines that driving the market. This is incredibly important. 
 
Then, we determine key scenarios in the market that will CONFIRM this for us. Once this is true, we will trade off our SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS. 
 
And lastly, we are studying the volume to see if the move is a relevant, an anomaly and supported. The trend is your friend most cases.  
 
#TIP If the $SPY is bullish, we tend to go long, buy calls, ADD ON DIPS and ADD on breakouts to the DAY the $SPY is red and sentiment has changed. On this day, we take a loss. I NEVER try to guess when the market is turning around. On the day the market turns around, I know by taking a few losses then I know right away today is the reversal. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Americans are seeing higher prices almost everywhere they look — from used vehicles, gasoline and energy, to furniture, apparel and groceries — and they might not feel much reprieve anytime soon, according to the nation’s top economists.

More than half (or 53 percent) of experts polled for Bankrate’s First-Quarter Economic Indicator poll say that inflation will likely be more significant than expected in the next 12 to 18 months, amid lingering supply bottlenecks and labor shortages, as well as new inflationary pressures in energy and food after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Meanwhile, just 21 percent of experts expect inflation to climb by a slower pace, and 26 percent say it should evolve as expected, according to the poll. Price increases have hit fresh 40-year highs for four straight months, rising most recently in February by 7.9 percent from a year ago.

“Investors are looking at a world based on prior constructs, mean-reverting cycles, where governments were constricted by spending limits, where there were unspoken rules and principles of economics. What if supply and demand no longer drive price discovery? When the government has a printing press, these ancient laws become obsolete. Do not trap yourself in prior precedents. Economic history is being re-written in real time. During “Project Zimbabwe” it’s important to assume that the impossible is now probable. Nothing will stop the money printing and asset inflation—once a country gets on the hamster wheel, the only option is to spin it faster. If anything, higher oil prices are yet another excuse to print faster.”

- Market Caps of 187M, 712M, and 156M, respectively - Large space to grow into their TAM 
- Recession Resistant Industries (Used Cars, Dog Food/Meds/Toys, Content)

“Investors are looking at a world based on prior constructs, mean-reverting cycles, where governments were constricted by spending limits, where there were unspoken rules and principles of economics. What if supply and demand no longer drive price discovery? When the government has a printing press, these ancient laws become obsolete. Do not trap yourself in prior precedents. Economic history is being re-written in real time. During “Project Zimbabwe” it’s important to assume that the impossible is now probable. Nothing will stop the money printing and asset inflation—once a country gets on the hamster wheel, the only option is to spin it faster. If anything, higher oil prices are yet another excuse to print faster.”

2. FED level of involvement is a new scenario that has impacted bonds. The inversion is very possibly a false signal due to this (many are hypothesizing).

3. Everyone is watching the bond yields now for a recession metric - this fact alone changes the game on whether it remains a good indicator. 

All that to say, I’ve been saying for a while, bullish next two years. Bearish election year - this would include a possible recession scenario in 2024.

Historically, when the yields have inverted, the market has been bullish the year following. Recession possibility is a while out - if it happens.

2) Massive labor shortage, tons of job listing =&amp;gt; They can&amp;#39;t fill the shitty jobs for slave pay no one wants, even desperate illegals.
3) Inflation is at 7% but stabilized =&amp;gt; It&amp;#39;s damn near 10-20% a month for items people need.
4) Progress in Russia/Ukraine talks =&amp;gt; Russia has an endless supply of meat fodder from conscripts, Ukraine is an endless market and beta tester of weapons, China is basking at its growing power. Besides nothing from Russia can ever be trusted. Like ever. To the end of Time and the Universe. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A few things to note when we trade $SPY $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL $FB  
 
We must ALWAYS determine the market sentiment and BIAS for that day based on the news and headlines that driving the market. This is incredibly important. 
 
Then, we determine key scenarios in the market that will CONFIRM this for us. Once this is true, we will trade off our SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS. 
 
And lastly, we are studying the volume to see if the move is a relevant, an anomaly and supported. The trend is your friend most cases.  
 
#TIP If the $SPY is bullish, we tend to go long, buy calls, ADD ON DIPS and ADD on breakouts to the DAY the $SPY is red and sentiment has changed. On this day, we take a loss. I NEVER try to guess when the market is turning around. On the day the market turns around, I know by taking a few losses then I know right away today is the reversal. </td>

When I read some of the fud that people post, it reminds me of why most people never become filthy rich. They dont have the same vision as other, more successful people do. They get angry over things that more successful people dont mind. They also dont take into account the realities of most situations. 

If some of these bears were around when $AAPL was a startup, I guarantee you theyd be fudding apple in just the same ways. 

Part of me wishes that everyone can realize when a good thing is in front of them, but at the same time, if that was the case then the rest of us would have a smaller share of the pie ? </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A few things to note when we trade $SPY $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL $FB  
 
We must ALWAYS determine the market sentiment and BIAS for that day based on the news and headlines that driving the market. This is incredibly important. 
 
Then, we determine key scenarios in the market that will CONFIRM this for us. Once this is true, we will trade off our SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS. 
 
And lastly, we are studying the volume to see if the move is a relevant, an anomaly and supported. The trend is your friend most cases.  
 
#TIP If the $SPY is bullish, we tend to go long, buy calls, ADD ON DIPS and ADD on breakouts to the DAY the $SPY is red and sentiment has changed. On this day, we take a loss. I NEVER try to guess when the market is turning around. On the day the market turns around, I know by taking a few losses then I know right away today is the reversal. </td>

Anyone here bullish on $TSLA ?
Besides buying calls on it, why not consider placing a bull put spread?

I’ve done a detailed guide on what a put credit spread is and how to place it via thinkorswim.

If you are keen, do take a look :)

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Not My best trading today , and feel like I was beat up 10 rounds in boxing ring, but squeezed out 17,333 on 2 $NVDA trades, got rid of 10k $PATH way to late at breakeven,  was too slow and didn&amp;#39;t trade well, and took to much risk ðŸ˜³ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ even had a $TSLA trade I had second thoughts on and cxl after only 100/1000 were filled .  below all trades from tues-today with timestamps (Monday in old posts)  , good week though 180k, all trades from week closed besides 10k $PATH at 23.50 im holding for a swing, it&amp;#39;s a tiny position in % of my overall portfolio, less then 3% but larger then my typical core position. 180k is 180k but man this trading ðŸ’© is stressful/ hard
Time for happy hour!  ðŸ¥ƒ </td>
