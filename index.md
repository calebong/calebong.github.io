   <td style="text-align:left;"> Indian Shares Wobble, Pharma Stocks Gain </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The BSE Sensex Index rose 0.1% toward 57,940 while the Nifty 50 Index fell 0.1% to 17,210 on Wednesday, as gains in pharmaceutical stocks were offset by other sectors as overall sentiment was dampened by market declines among regional peers. Indian pharma stocks advanced after the country approved Merck’s Covid antiviral pill and two more vaccines for emergency use, led by gains from Sun Pharmaceutical (1.5%), Cipla Ltd (1%), Supriya Lifescience (4.5%), Divi’s Laboratorie (1.7%) and Dr Reddys Labs (1.7%). Several Indian drugmakers signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing areements with Merck earlier this year to manufacture and supply molnupiravir in the country. Elsewhere, digital mapping firm CE Info Systems, which debuted in the market last week, extended the previous session’s gain by climbing another 8%. Meanwhile, stocks in the wider Asian market slipped following a mixed Wall Street session as the region's investors positioned their portfolios for the new year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK cost of living squeeze in 2022, says think tank </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Millions of families are facing a "year of the squeeze" in 2022, a think tank has warned.                                                                                                                        , The Resolution Foundation predicts higher energy bills, stagnant wages and tax rises could leave households with a £1,200 a year hit to their incomes.                                                           , Its report highlights the rise in the energy price cap and National Insurance contributions from April.                                                                                                          , The government says it has put £4.2bn in place to support families.                                                                                                                                              , According to the Resolution Foundation, millions of families are facing a "cost-of-living catastrophe" next year.                                                                                                , It says a 1.25% increase in National Insurance contributions will cost the average household £600 a year while the higher energy bills cap is expected to add an additional £500 to spending.                    , The impact of the failure of firms in energy sector would see another £100 added to energy bills.                                                                                                                , In recent months, wholesale gas prices have risen to unprecedented levels. Last week, they hit a new record of 450p per therm, which experts think could take average annual gas bills to about £2,000 next year., Meanwhile, the cost of living in the UK surged by 5.1% in the 12 months to November - the highest increase in 10 years - Office for National Statistics data showed.                                             , Resolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell, said: "The overall picture is likely to be one of prices surging and pay packets stagnating."                                                                , He said Chancellor Rishi Sunak could face increased pressure to take action to alleviate his economic plan set out in the Autumn Budget.                                                                         , The report by the foundation says that poorer families are going to be the worse hit by the "year of the squeeze", as they spend a higher proportion of their income on energy.                                  , A government spokesman said its help included reducing the Universal Credit taper, as well as measures to assist with bills, including cold weather payments and a freeze in alcohol and fuel duty.              , How many can you recognise by sound alone?                                                                                                                                                                       , Laura Mvula plays some of her favourite music from 2021                                                                                                                                                          , © 2021 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold Under Pressure from Rising Dollar </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold hovered just above $1,800 an ounce on Wednesday after briefly hitting $1,820 in the previous session, pressured by an uptick in the dollar. The greenback, which languished against riskier assets recently amid an improving risk appetite, started to gain ground on Tuesday as it rallied sharply against emerging market currencies and other risk-sensitive assets. Robust US economic data and persistent inflation also buoyed the dollar, with the Fed-preferred PCE index surging 5.7% in November, its highest level since 1982. The Federal Reserve made a hawkish turn in recent statements, signaling three quarter point interest rate hikes next year to combat inflation. A stronger dollar makes bullion prices more expensive for buyers holding other currencies, reducing its appeal. Meanwhile, subdued US bond yields provided support to gold prices, with the benchmark 10 year yield hovering below 1.5%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Why Biden isn't likely to find much political relief abroad in 2022 - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Joe Biden hasn't had a day in the White House free of intractable domestic challenges that threaten to doom his presidency. But his hopes of a 2022 rebound are complicated by equally treacherous tests abroad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The United States faces at least two potential national security crises that could explode in short order. First, it must try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Russia in what would be Moscow's boldest bid yet to reshape the post-Cold War order. And unless talks bear fruit soon, Iran could reach the threshold of being a nuclear weapons power, and leave Biden with an excruciating choice of whether to respond with military action that could draw the US back into a Middle East conflagration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , As grave as each situation is, both in some ways are a distraction from the epochal 21st-century US foreign policy conundrum: how to handle an increasingly powerful and aggressive China. The intense diplomatic and military attention Washington would need to devote to a showdown with Iran or Russia would delight Beijing, after its rise to prominence coincided with the US quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Of course, a restive world could present Biden with unexpected problems. For instance, no president, possibly since Bill Clinton in the 1990s, has thwarted North Korea's nuclear march. And the Stalinist state, marking 10 years under volatile dictator Kim Jong Un, is forging ahead with missiles that could deliver its nuclear bombs to US soil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But Pyongyang is not alone in defying the US. Biden's political fortunes back home have been partly tarnished by rising gasoline prices following his failure to coax major oil producers in the Gulf to pump more crude. The pandemic, meanwhile, threatens to cause more upheaval overseas that could impact US national security. And the Omicron surge could again jam up global supply chains -- ramping up the inflation that threatens Biden's Democrats in midterm elections next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , It's not all been bad news for the President, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman who boasted on the campaign trail of his statesmanship chops. There has been some diplomatic deftness in his first year in office. Declaring "America is back," Biden soothed allies bruised by former President Donald Trump's tantrums and insults. He's convinced Western governments to draw up a daunting package of punishments for Russia to deter it from breaching Ukraine's borders -- and is offering security talks to Moscow in a long-shot bid to ease tensions. Early last year, he appeared to talk Russian President Vladimir Putin down after a previous Ukraine buildup. And while Trump reset America's course in adopting a confrontational posture toward China, Biden has done better in getting US allies in Europe and the Pacific to back US strategy. , But his diplomacy has yet to change President Xi Jinping's nationalistic, expansionist path, after crushing Hong Kong's remaining democracy and as fears grow that he might eventually try to reunify Taiwan with the mainland by force -- a move that could suck the United States into a disastrous war with its Asian rival.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Immediate tests as the new year dawns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Biden's foreign policy credibility will come in for early scrutiny in 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The most intensive diplomatic offensive of his administration so far is seeking to convince Putin to stand down tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine. The integrity of NATO and the health of his own political position depend on Biden defusing the crisis without caving to security guarantees demanded by the Russian leader. Putin, for instance, wants NATO to pull forces from ex-Warsaw Pact nations that joined the alliance -- a condition that could destroy Western credibility and incentivize further Russian adventurism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In the latest development, the White House said Tuesday that US and Russian officials would meet on January 10. US, Russian and NATO officials will also be in touch over the following few days. Russia has been agitating for another in-person Biden-Putin summit, a piece of diplomatic choreography that would evoke old Cold War sit-downs. But Biden must walk a fine line -- as he could be accused of appeasing Putin should he eventually move on Ukraine -- while finding an off-ramp for the Russian leader that allows him to save face. The showdown has profound political implications for both Biden and Putin. And the Russian leader, who sees a historic task of reestablishing Russian power at the expense of the US, is a wily adversary who has outmaneuvered the last three US presidents.                                                                 , As their European counterparts try to prevent a war on the continent, America's nuclear negotiators are striving to revive the 2015 nuclear deal involving the US and Iran, which was fractured by Trump's walkout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Despite some optimism expressed by Russian negotiators at the latest session of talks in Vienna underway since Monday, the US has been deeply skeptical that the diplomatic track will deliver. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Tuesday that it was "too soon to tell" whether Iran's new hardline government has returned to the table interested in negotiating. And any progress still fell short of "Iran's accelerating nuclear steps," Price added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , New talks -- at which the US and Iran don't meet directly -- are unfolding after top US negotiator Robert Malley issued a dire warning days before Christmas. He told CNN's Becky Anderson that Tehran's increasing uranium enrichment meant that time was running short for a deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "If they continue at their current pace, we have some weeks left but not much more than that, at which point, I think, the conclusion will be that there's no deal to be revived," said Malley, the US Iran envoy. US officials believe Iran is now within months of acquiring the materials for a nuclear bomb. Some Israelis are talking of weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Iran is demanding that the US lift all sanctions before it will roll back enrichment. The US is offering a sequenced approach. Its position is complicated by the Biden administration's inability to pledge that a future Republican administration would honor any deal. Iran has said it is now enriching uranium up to 60% purity, its highest-ever level and much closer to the 90% threshold needed to build a nuclear bomb. Its progress exposes the utter failure of Trump's "maximum pressure" policy, introduced when Iran was complying with the Obama administration pact to cap its nuclear program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , If diplomacy fails now, Biden -- or ,more immediately, Israel -- will face the question of whether to launch a military strike against Tehran's facilities that could set the Middle East aflame once again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Biden's fate at home and abroad is entwined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Much of Biden's overseas leverage in coming days depends on how he is perceived by US allies and foes after a year in office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The biggest blemish on his record so far is the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The President had pledged to Americans there would be no Saigon-style exit from Kabul, yet that's what happened. Administration claims that the hurried evacuation was a massive success were undercut by video footage of what was really happening -- and the deaths of 13 US service members and many more Afghans in a suicide bombing outside the airport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The debacle dented Biden's authority at home and abroad, despite claims by Democrats that Americans didn't really care how US troops left the nation's longest war and that they just wanted them home. The mess also offered an opening for Republicans to brand the new President as feckless -- even though those GOP critics were quiet when Trump was genuflecting to global tyrants. In foreign capitals, the withdrawal that came with little warning for allies raised new questions about US staying power. As did Biden's cold-eyed view of US interests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Tortured domestic politics are also hampering Biden's bid to put a stamp on the world. While his swift return to the Paris climate agreement pleased America's friends, his capacity to keep commitments is in doubt after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he couldn't vote for the President's Build Back Better plan, which includes a historic $500 billion investment in fighting global warming. Biden's attempt to enlist the world's democracies in a quest to preserve the liberal world order is, meanwhile, constantly undermined by Trump's incessant attempts to destroy American democracy. And the prospect that the 45th President could return to the White House in 2025 means many foreign powers doubt Biden's promise that America is back.                                                                                                                 , Presidents under fire at home often seek easy wins abroad, but Biden lacks such a luxury since he is serving when America's global power is more challenged than at any time since World War II. At the same time, raging US political divisions back in the United States offer openings to adversaries like Putin and Xi. It's a vicious circle that plays into the hands of Republicans determined to portray Biden as a weak failure. So, as tough as 2022 promises to be for Biden at home, he's unlikely to get much relief overseas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , CNN's Natasha Bertrand and Kyle Feldscher contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures held onto gains near 1-month highs above $78 per barrel on Wednesday, as risk appetite remained robust, while traders continued to assess the threat of the omicron variant. Oil prices have clawed back losses from late November when news of the new variant first broke. The latest South African research showed that omicron infections can boost immunity against the delta variant and potentially displace it. Moreover, major economies including Britain and France held off from imposing more virus curbs before the year-end. On the supply side, an industry report showed that US crude inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels last week, less than market expectations. Traders also await the next OPEC+ meeting on Jan. 4, as the group is set to decide whether to go ahead with a planned 400,000 barrels per day production increase in February. Oil prices have gained more than 50% this year due to the return of demand and supply cuts by major oil-producing countries. </td>

The latest figure pointed to the third straight month of gains in industrial output and the strongest pace since June, boosted by a further relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions and increasing vaccination levels as well as a rise in exports. The government expects the manufacturing production index to grow 5.2 percent this year and between 4 to 5 percent in 2022 following a 9.3 percent drop in 2020. </td>

That total represents all of the vested options that would have expired next year, which Mr. Musk earned under a 2012 compensation package.                                                                                                        , The transactions have boosted Mr. Musk’s holding in Tesla from around 170.5 million shares to more than 177 million shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The combined share sales over that past few weeks have reached a value of more than $16 billion. The sales mostly are linked to a scheduled investment plan Mr. Musk set in September, according to disclosures.                                                                                                                                                  , After setting the investment plan, Mr. Musk last month polled Twitter users about whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock; people on the social-media platform that voted endorsed the idea of a sale. The chief executive began exercising Tesla stock options and selling shares in the company on Nov. 8.                                                , CHINESE CITIZENS BLAST ELON MUSK'S SPACE AMBITIONS AFTER ALLEGED CLOSE CONTACT BETWEEN SATELLITES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Musk has sold around 15.7 million shares since then. How many shares constitute fulfilling his 10% pledge depends on how Mr. Musk defines his ownership stake. Mr. Musk, who is compensated by Tesla in stock awards and doesn’t accept a cash salary from the company, last week said on Twitter that "there are still a few tranches left, but almost done.", Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether Mr. Musk planned to sell more of the company’s stock in the coming weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Musk has a net worth of around $279 billion, making him the richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

He has verbally sparred with some Democrat lawmakers over taxes, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who called on the billionaire to pay more. Mr. Musk responded by saying that he will pay more taxes than any American in history this year.                                    , Mr. Musk is likely to have future rounds of such trading activity under a blockbuster 2018 compensation plan approved by shareholders.

China reported 209 infections on Tuesday, the highest one-day tally since March last year, and while low in comparison to rampant cases in Western countries, has prompted authorities to impose the “strictest” possible curbs in the northern city of Xi’an whose 13 million residents are entering a 6th day of home confinement. The country has followed a “zero Covid-19” strategy of tight border controls, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns as Beijing prepares to welcome thousands of visitors to February’s Winter Olympics. Losses in consumer-related stocks outweighed gains in new energy firms, with declines from Kweichow Moutai (-3%), Wuliangye Yibin (-3.3%) and Luzhou Lao (-4.5%). </td>

"I want to thank everyone who has been along for any part of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Speaking of great rides, I was lucky enough to be carried off the field after we won Super Bowl XI. I was told it took like five or six guys to lift me up, then they dropped me. But that's OK, because that was me and that was them. They aren't going to carry me off. You carry him off for a while, boom! You dump him on the ground. But it was the happiest moment of my life.", CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Vinyl sales soared again in 2021, thanks to Abba </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Albums by Adele, Abba and Ed Sheeran helped vinyl sales in the UK top five million for the first time since 1991.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Almost a quarter of the albums bought this year (23%) were on vinyl, with Abba's Voyage the biggest-seller.                                                                                                                                                                                             , It marks the format's 14th consecutive year of growth, with sales up by 8% on 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Sales of CDs continued to fall. Just 14 million discs were bought - the lowest figure since 1984, one year after the format was introduced in the UK.                                                                                                                                                   , However, the drop-off in CD sales was smaller than in recent years, with sales decreasing by 12%, compared to nearly a third in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                   , That's partly because artists like Abba and Adele appeal to older listeners, who still prefer the format.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Music industry body the BPI said it hoped that the reduced demand for CDs was "bottoming out" after years of decline.                                                                                                                                                                                   , The vinyl resurgence continued in 2021 despite serious delays in manufacturing, caused by a combination of Covid, supply-chain issues and labour shortages, as well as a scarcity of raw materials like PVC and paper products.                                                                         , One report blamed Adele for further clogging up the world's vinyl plants with pre-orders for her new album, 30 - but her order of 500,000 records only accounted for 0.3% of the LPs pressed this year. (A bigger problem is that demand for vinyl outstrips manufacturing capacity by a factor of 2:1)., In the end, Adele's return was eclipsed by that of Abba, who took the world by surprise in September by announcing their first album of new material in more than 40 years.                                                                                                                             , Titled Voyage, it shifted 29,891 copies in its first week on sale, following an extensive pre-order campaign that gave fans early access to tickets for the Swedes' virtual concerts next year.                                                                                                         , Voyage duly became the fastest seller on vinyl this century, according to the Official Charts Company.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Cassette sales, while representing a tiny fraction of the music market, also increased for a ninth consecutive year.                                                                                                                                                                                    , Final figures for 2021 are likely to show that around 190,000 tapes were purchased in the past 12 months, up by around 20% year on year.                                                                                                                                                                , It's the format's most successful year since 2003, when Now 54 was the year's biggest seller on cassette.                                                                                                                                                                                               , The revival arguably has more to do with marketing than any real appetite for the format, however.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Most artists now offer signed cassettes on their official website, frequently in bundles with CD or vinyl copies of the same album.                                                                                                                                                                     , Fans often have no choice but to accept the cassette as part of the bundle; and each copy of the record handily counts as a separate sale on the official chart.                                                                                                                                        , Sales of physical formats are dwarfed by the popularity of streaming, which accounted for 80.6% of music consumption in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                           , Even so, having an album available on CD and vinyl plays a pivotal role in artists reaching number one.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Adele's 30, for example, has seen 75% of its chart sales attributable to physical format purchases during its five-week reign at the top of the charts.                                                                                                                                                 , Despite that, streaming's share of the market is thought to have increased further this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The BPI will report that data, along with the year's final music consumption figures, on 4 January,                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The House select committee investigating January 6 has stood down on its requests for some documents from the Trump White House, after the Biden administration convinced the panel to scale back its pursuits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , As a result, the committee won't be getting hundreds of pages of National Security Council records. But the documents may not have been all that helpful, anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The revelation comes in a new round of letters about the status of Trump-era documents held by the National Archives. It's the first time the Biden administration appears to have pushed back significantly against the House select committee, as the National Archives works through thousands of pages of records from the Trump administration at the request of the House committee.                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , At least some of the House's document requests appear to have gone too far, even for the Biden administration. Such a development isn't out of the ordinary during a congressional inquiry into West Wing affairs, but it hadn't emerged yet for the House select committee, which had been essentially aligned with the Biden White House on questions of access.                                                                                                                                                                             , The curtailing of the House panel's request, however, may not affect its core mission of understanding then-President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential vote and the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6. That's because this latest round of documents over which Congress and the executive branch negotiated "appear to have no content that might be material to the Select Committee's investigation," the Biden White House said in a letter this month.                                                 , It said it wants to keep these records secret to preserve the confidentiality of discussions and advice around the presidency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "President Biden recognizes that Congress has a compelling need, in service of its legislative functions, to understand the circumstances that led to the insurrection," wrote Jonathan Su, a lawyer for the Biden White House. "The documents for which the Select Committee has agreed to withdraw or defer its request do not appear to bear on the White House's preparations for or response to the events of January 6, or on efforts to overturn the election or otherwise obstruct the peaceful transfer of power."                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The House is still seeking -- and the Biden administration is willing to release -- more than 700 pages of crucial Trump White House records documenting Trump's and top advisers' discussions, phone calls and visits up to and on January 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But Trump filed a lawsuit to block their release and continues to claim that several hundred pages should be kept private, under his assertions of executive privilege. He is asking the Supreme Court to hear his case, after losing at two lower courts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Before this month, the National Archives had processed and weighed the positions of Trump and of the current White House on at least four separate collections of documents. As the review of records continued at the archives, the Biden administration in recent weeks looked at 511 pages from the National Security Council during Trump's presidency, as the House committee has been seeking a broad swath of documents from the former President's time in office.                                                                     , "The Select Committee has agreed to withdraw or defer its request for a significant portion of those records," White House counsel Dana Remus wrote to the archives on December 17.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The committee issued a statement later Tuesday, making clear that it wasn't dropping parts of its pursuit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "The Select Committee welcomes President Biden's decision to clear the way for the production of another set of records," a committee spokesperson said in the statement. "The committee has agreed to defer action on certain records as part of the accommodations process, as was the case with an earlier tranche of records. The Select Committee has not withdrawn its request for these records and will continue to engage with the executive branch to ensure the committee gets access to all the information relevant to our probe.", Even so, the committee could face a drawn-out negotiation with the Biden administration if it does still push for access to national security records, either because of potential standoffs over executive privilege or issues related to classified or law-enforcement sensitive material, the White House suggested in its letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , There was a previous situation in October where the House committee backed off pursuing a much smaller collection of January 6 documents, as it headed to court against Trump, and without the same level of public pushback from the Biden White House.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , This story has been updated with a statement from the House select committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , CNN's Annie Grayer contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stock futures rise slightly after Dow notches fifth straight day of gains </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , U.S. stock futures ticked higher Tuesday night following a mixed session as traders continued to assess the threat of the omicron Covid-19 variant.                                                                                                                                                , Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 38 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.                                                                                                                                                    , There have been more than 4.1 million Covid cases confirmed in the U.S. this month, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That's well above November's tally of 2.54 million. The country's seven-day average of cases is also at 231,888 cases, more than triple the mean from Nov. 27., However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently shortened its isolation recommendation for people who test positive from 10 days to five if they don't have symptoms. Research from South Africa also shows that omicron infections can boost immunity against the delta variant. , Stocks were under pressure in late November, when news of the omicron variant first broke. They have since rebounded, however, with the S&amp;P 500 up 4.8% for December.                                                                                                                              , Virtus Investment Partners' Joe Terranova told CNBC's "Closing Bell" that the market has shown resiliency in the past few weeks, as traders weigh the omicron variant and potentially tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve next year.                                                  , Here are Wall Street's favorite picks in the S&amp;P 500 for 2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The 'Dogs of the Dow' for 2022 could hold some big winners.

"I don't think the market wants the speculative areas in which investors have been rewarded the last couple of years. That's the hyper-growth stocks, the high P/E, the crypto, the cannabis [names]."              , During the regular trading session, the Dow notched its fifth straight day of gains, rising more than 90 points.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sierra Nevada in California sees record December snow - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)After months of extreme drought that triggered water shortages and stoked wildfires, heavy snow is falling in the Sierra Nevada -- enough to break decades-old records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , As of Tuesday, more than 202 inches of snow -- nearly 17 feet -- had fallen so far this month at the University of California, Berkeley's Central Sierra Snow Laboratory, at Donner Pass east of Sacramento.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Scientists at the lab said this month is now the snowiest December on record for the location and the third snowiest month overall. The top month was January 2017 when 238 inches fell, and it's not likely enough snow will fall in the next three days to challenge that record. Records here go back to 1970.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Lab officials said the snow was "deep and hard to get through," and it took them roughly 40 minutes to get to where the measurements are taken just 150 feet away from the lab's front door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , It's a ton of snow and was much needed, but Andrew Schwartz, the lead scientist and station manager of the Sierra snow laboratory, said they are going to need more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "While this event has been amazing so far, we are really concerned about the upcoming months not having as many storms," Schwartz told CNN. "If we don't get another inch, we're still below what we would expect for the entire winter, which means that we can contribute to the drought rather than resolving it."                                                                                                                                                                                                              , High-elevation snowpack serves as a natural reservoir that eases drought, storing water through the winter months and slowly releasing it through the spring melting season. Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada accounts for 30% of California's fresh water supply in an average year, according to the California Department of Water Resources. The snowpack in the Sierra was at alarmingly low levels at the end of last winter and reservoirs, which are replenished by spring snow melt, are still below the historical average. , The Lake Oroville reservoir, for instance, is currently 37% full, which is low compared to its historical average of 71% during the same time. The Oroville hydroelectric power plant was forced to shut down this summer, because of its low water level, for the first time since it opened in 1967.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , This summer's drought was the most extreme in California's 126-year record, and July 2021 was the driest month since data gathering began in 1895. Across the region, the magnitude of the drought hovered at or above 90% since June, with several states entirely in drought.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Then in October, California and parts of the Pacific Northwest got a taste of the rain they were looking for. The onset of the rainy season brought in the strong storms that draw moisture from the Pacific Ocean, referred to as atmospheric rivers. These wintertime storms have been crucial in determining whether California is going to end up in drought. During the previous two winters, only one such storm brought meaningful precipitation.                                                                           , As climate change accelerates and winter temperatures increase, snowfall is expected to decrease. Schwartz said he is finding that what used to fall as snow is now falling as rain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "Ultimately, what's happening right now in terms of climate change with our precipitation here on the summit is that we're actually seeing increasing precipitation, but the difference is we're seeing a reduction in snowfall and an increase in rain," Schwartz said. "So that matches our warming signal; with that warming, we have actually moved away from some of our snowfall."                                                                                                                                           , Scientists have found climate change is not just increasing the severity of extreme weather, it is interrupting the natural patterns, causing wild swings between dry and wet extremes. California has seen this "weather whiplash" in recent years where atmospheric river storms cause destructive floods one year and extreme drought causing water shortages the next.                                                                                                                                                         , Similarly, Schwartz said they see conditions at the summit switch from a snow-free winter to a blizzard next season. But he also said snow is clearly decreasing in the Sierra Nevada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "And that's really going to be what we see and what we do see frequently up here," he added. "So as those temperatures increase, we'll see a lot less of the stuff that we had yesterday that had us trudging out for 40 minutes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Record-breaking snowfall aside, Schwartz said he's already seeing firsthand the grim consequences of the climate crisis in the Sierra Nevada.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "Overall, the trends with climate change in the region is kind of a dire one with respect to snow, because we're not going to have it for a whole lot longer," he said. "So when we have months like this, I'm very excited for them."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , </td>

They have called for the Fed to take a tougher stance in regulating big banks and a bolder approach in addressing financial risks posed by climate change.                                                                                                                                                   , Sarah Bloom Raskin has served as a Fed governor, Treasury official and Maryland’s commissioner of financial regulation (Photo: Yuri Gripas/Reuters)  (Reuters)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , STOCKS IN 2022 FACE BUMPY RIDE AS S&amp;P SITS AT RECORD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In a speech in September 2009, Ms. Raskin blamed the financial crisis on "a deregulatory fervor that marginalized the interests of many" and said the downturn had been "brought upon us through a combination of greed, weak regulation and weak enforcement."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , While serving as a Fed governor from 2010 to 2014, Ms. Raskin was deeply involved in behind-the-scenes work to write rules implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Since leaving the government, Ms. Raskin has spoken out on the need for the Fed and other federal financial regulators to more proactively address growing threats from climate-related events such as natural disasters and wildfires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "There is opportunity in pre-emptive, early and bold actions by federal economic policy makers looking to avoid catastrophe," Ms. Raskin wrote in the foreword of a report last year from the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Markets, a climate advocacy group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has signaled to the White House she would support either Ms. Raskin or Richard Cordray, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s first confirmed director, who also has been under consideration for the Fed’s banking-regulator post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 19: Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, speaks during a Senate Finance Committee on the nomination of Chris Magnus to be the next US Customs and Border Protection commissioner in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The potential nominations of Ms. Cook and Mr. Jefferson, both Black economists, would help Mr. Biden achieve his promise to improve diversity atop the central bank, which in its 108-year history has had only three Black board members, all of them men. The most recent was former Fed Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson, who left the board in 2006.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Fed’s seven-seat board of governors has one vacancy with two more looming. Governor Randal Quarles has said he would resign by the end of the month, and the term of Vice Chairman Richard Clarida ends next month. The White House’s slate of nominees for these three seats could still change before an official announcement is made, as soon as early January.                                                                                                                                                                                           , With a closely divided Senate, Mr. Biden needs either universal support of Democrats to confirm his nominees or support from some Republicans to overcome holdouts from his own party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After serving as a Fed governor, Ms. Raskin, an attorney, served in the Obama administration as deputy secretary at the Treasury Department from 2014 to 2017. She was confirmed by a voice vote in the Senate for both posts. Before that, she served as Maryland’s state commissioner of financial regulation. She currently is a law professor at Duke University and is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.).                                                                                                                                               , At the Treasury, Ms. Raskin led efforts to address the financial stability risks of cybersecurity. At the Fed, she maintained a low profile on monetary policy and backed then-Chairman Ben Bernanke’s effort to provide economic stimulus by purchasing government bonds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , More recently, in a New York Times opinion article in May 2020, Ms. Raskin was critical of broad-based emergency-lending backstops enacted by the Treasury and Fed to assist businesses during the pandemic because she believed they should have taken steps to prevent lending to oil-and-gas concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , FILE - This May 4, 2021, file photo shows the Federal Reserve building in Washington.

He was an economics professor at Swarthmore College from 1997 to 2019 and spent a year as a staff economist in the division of monetary affairs at the Fed board in the 1990s.                                                                                       , His research has focused on labor markets and poverty, including a 2008 paper that examines economic volatility faced by African-American families and female-headed households and its relationship to declining volatility in economic output. In 2005, he analyzed the costs and benefits of policies that promote a "high-pressure economy" to spur tighter labor markets, arguing that the latter outweighed the former.                                                                                                                                     , In a 2018 interview with a publication of the Minneapolis Fed, Mr. Jefferson discussed the challenges of being a member of a minority group in the economics field. "I have never been in an economics department with another African-American economist. Never," he said. "My passion and enjoyment of learning new things, of writing and having a voice in different conversations, compensates me for the absence of colleagues who look like me."                                                                                                           , President Joe Biden speaks during a virtual meeting with the House Democratic caucus in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, on the White House complex, Wednesday, March 3, 2021, in Washington.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Manuel Perez, former Editorial Director of CNN Digital, dies at 57 - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Manuel Perez found a new hobby after moving to north Georgia's Blue Ridge Mountains late in his life. He became an amateur landscaper, planting Japanese maples and other perennials in his yard while creating a moon garden where pale-hued flowers reflect moonlight.                                                                                                        , It was a dramatic change from the frantic pace of Perez's career in newsrooms as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and former Editorial Director at CNN Digital. But the slower rhythms of planting, pruning and watching things blossom seemed to calm and delight him.                                                                                                            , "Those were extraordinary gardens he built in the last three to five years," said Mitch Gelman, a former CNN senior vice president and executive producer who worked with Perez for much of his career. "Anything he touched flourished in that environment."                                                                                                                         , Perez, who died at 57 on Monday after a four-month struggle with cancer, had the same impact on the people he worked with at CNN. He had an extraordinary ability to cultivate the talents of colleagues who bloomed under his leadership in ways they never expected.                                                                                                                , "Working for Manuel meant looking forward to every day on the job. It was a demanding one, for sure, and Manuel held the bar high because he was an ambitious, talented and thoughtful journalist," said Jan Winburn, a former CNN senior editor.                                                                                                                                     , "But he also understood what it was to be human, to make mistakes, to miss deadlines, to fall short. So while he taught me to be a better journalist, by his example I also saw what it meant to be a caring and compassionate person."                                                                                                                                               , He took an unlikely path to journalism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Perez dedicated his professional life to journalism in a distinguished career that took him from Newsday to The Washington Post to CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , It was a long way from his roots in a fishing village in northwest Spain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Perez was born in 1964 in Ribeira, a coastal town in the region of Galicia. His father died before he was born. His mother, wanting more opportunities for her son and only child, immigrated with him to the US when Manuel was 7.                                                                                                                                                   , They settled in Lakewood, New Jersey, where his mother found a job at an industrial kitchen, making blintzes and other kosher foods. Her sacrifice and work ethic were an inspiration to her son.                                                                                                                                                                                     , "He said no matter how sick or tired she was, she never missed a day of work in her entire career," Gelman said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Perez graduated from a local high school and earned a scholarship to NYU, where he intended to study business before a journalism class changed the course of his career. He landed an internship at New York Newsday, which soon turned into a full-time job as a reporter covering the city.                                                                                        , Perez was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992 for coverage of a late-night subway derailment in Manhattan that left five passengers dead and more than 200 injured. He was one of the first reporters on the scene and fed details of the tragedy back to the newsroom.                                                                                                  , When New York Newsday shuttered in 1995, Perez went to work as a reporter for The Washington Post, covering the suburbs around the nation's capital. He made the leap to digital news in 2001, when Gelman -- a former Newsday colleague -- hired him to run the Washington bureau for what was then known as CNN.com.                                                                , A year later, Perez moved with his family to Atlanta to help lead CNN's digital operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "He brought high standards," Gelman said. "Manuel was the backbone through at least two or three generations of leadership that enabled CNN to become as respected for its digital journalism as it was for its television news."                                                                                                                                                     , He earned respect as a leader and mentor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , At CNN, he was the soft-spoken, bespectacled man in the stylish turtleneck sweaters who ambled around the digital newsroom with a Starbucks coffee in his hand. "Manny," as he was known to many staffers, always seemed to have his office door open to anyone who wanted to chat.                                                                                                   , Newsrooms are often led by Type A personalities full of bombast. But Meredith Artley, senior vice president and editor-in-chief of CNN Digital Worldwide, said she never saw Perez lose his temper. He was always approachable, regardless of anyone's job title, she said.                                                                                                           , "He made everyone feel heard," Artley said. "He did not listen to people in power more than those not in power."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Amanda Barnett, a former CNN producer who worked under Perez, recalls an incident when, in the rush to report breaking news, she and other newsroom leaders issued an alert that contained a factual error.                                                                                                                                                                           , Instead of scolding her, Perez calmly helped her craft a new alert with the correct information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "There were no recriminations. No yelling, no judging me for getting it wrong," Barnett said. "We did the best we could with the information we had at the time. Then we corrected our mistakes. That is how it should work."                                                                                                                                                         , At CNN, Perez helped oversee news coverage, editorial priorities and relaunches of CNN's desktop and mobile platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Rachel Clarke, a CNN Digital senior editor, recalled that while Perez was sometimes quiet in conversations and in meetings, his words carried disproportionate weight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "I marveled at the way the 8a meeting would sometimes have big debates and we'd all jump in with thoughts and ideas and ramble all over the place," she said. "And then, at the end -- or sometimes in the middle if he wanted to move on -- Manuel would bring it all together with just one sentence or direction that was always better than everything we'd been rabbiting about.", People who knew him the best remember his kindness and his sly, understated sense of humor. Perez had an easy smile and a big laugh that filled a room. He was a crack crossword solver and such a formidable poker player that some victims dubbed him the "silent assassin."                                                                                                        , Linda Rathke, a managing editor at CNN, recalls the first job interview she had with Perez in 2007. She was pumped with adrenaline, bombarding him with ideas and questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "A little more than halfway through our interview," she said, "Manuel shifted in his chair, smiled, looked over the top of his glasses and asked, 'Is it ok if I ask YOU questions now?' "                                                                                                                                                                                            , They both laughed, and Rathke got the job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Whatever nervousness I felt slipped away," Rathke said. "That's how talking with Manuel always was -- easy, direct, often funny, and always smart."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , As an immigrant, Perez understood what it was like to feel like an outsider. Many former colleagues cited his role as a mentor to staffers who feared they didn't belong at CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Valerie Streit, then a young producer, said Perez taught her how to navigate office politics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "Manny's support lifted me and so many others who were underrepresented in the newsroom -- helping me overcome impostor syndrome and insecurities about how to claim my authority and inhabit my voice," said Streit, who now works for Google.                                                                                                                                       , While many CNN staffers mentioned Perez's journalistic smarts, more praised him for his humane management style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "When I talk to young aspiring journalists, I give them this advice: More important than the specific job they will do, more important than the prestige of the organization they hope to work for is the values and character of the person who will be their boss," Winburn said.                                                                                                   , "And when I say this, I think of Manuel."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , His final days brought an outpouring of affection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Perez left CNN in 2016. He eventually eased into an early retirement at his home in rural Tiger, Georgia, with his wife, educator Gabriela Ortiz-Perez, who runs a small Montessori school nearby.                                                                                                                                                                                    , The two had met in 1990 at a wedding of mutual friends in Mexico -- "It was instant. We just fell in love," she said -- and were married a year later. They had a son, Joaquin, and spent part of each summer visiting Perez's relatives in Spain.                                                                                                                                    , Perez's cancer was diagnosed in August of this year but spread quickly. This fall, as his health was declining, Gelman went to Perez's home for a visit. He asked Perez whether friends and colleagues could write to him.                                                                                                                                                            , Perez, who by then had difficulty speaking, indicated yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Gelman then made a joke: Was there anybody he didn't want to hear from?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Perez gave him a big smile and said no.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , That answer reflected the type of life he lived, Gelman said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "He didn't have anybody who didn't like him," he said.

Gabriela was by his side. Joaquin, now 24 and a graduate student in Miami, arrived later that day.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In his final weeks, as news of Perez's illness spread, the cards, letters and emails poured in, full of appreciation and fond reminiscences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Story after story after story, hundreds of them," Gabriela said.

She noted that a ship could become subject to CDC observation if 0.1% or more passengers or even a single crewmember had tested positive within the last seven days.                         , Also see: ‘They think $100 per room is enough compensation?’ Caribbean cruise denied entry by ports due to COVID-19 outbreak                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , In some cases, ships were not able to visit planned stops during the itinerary because of the COVID-19 cases among passengers.

The variant is believed to be more easily transmissible than previous forms of the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , It’s the latest blow for the cruise line industry, which has struggled to recover after being shut down by public-health officials at the height of the pandemic. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the most prominent outbreaks occurred on cruise ships. In the months that followed, many countries prohibited ships from docking because of concerns about the virus’ spread. Other cruise lines had deaths from the coronavirus on board and, as the industry suspended services, shares of cruise lines plummeted., When cruise lines resumed operations this year, most began requiring passengers to be vaccinated against COVID and to provide proof of a negative COVID test. Other changes were also made to the cruising experience to reduce the possibility of transmission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Affordability has dropped to the lowest level since 2008 nationwide, amid rising interest rates and home prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Jacob Passy is a personal-finance reporter for MarketWatch and is based in New York. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks traded mixed on Tuesday amid low liquidity and as traders continue to weigh the impact the omicron coronavirus variant will have on the economy. The S&amp;P 500 swung between small gains and losses, and closed 0.1% below a record high hit on Monday, the Dow added around 80 points extending the recent rally for the 5th session, while the Nasdaq fell nearly 0.6%. Global Covid-19 cases hit a daily record yesterday with many countries imposing restrictions and several studies suggesting the new strain is highly contagious but causes less severe illness. On the corporate front, Walt Disney (1.5%), Boeing (1.4%), and Walmart (1.3%) were among the top performers, while Dexcon (-6.7%) led the losses. It will be a soft week in terms of economic releases but stocks typically rise in the last days of the year, the so-called “Santa Claus rally”. So far in the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 28.5%, the Nasdaq 23%, and the Dow Jones 18.6% </td>

        -4.30%
       dropped 2.8% in afternoon trading Tuesday, putting them on track for the lowest close since May 4, 2020, after Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said he's seen signs of "continued softness" in the December quarter. The at-home fitness company's stock has plummeted 58.5% since it reported after the Nov. 4 closing bell a wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss as revenue came up short of forecasts. Kessler also said he expects the company's 2022 financial guidance could end up even more downbeat than when it was provided last month. "When Peloton provided guidance, we believe the company was assuming a return to stronger seasonality in the December quarter following the slower summer seasonality," Kessler wrote in a note to clients. "Based on continued soft Google search trends data, we believe this could prove aggressive." He affirmed the market perform rating he's had on the stock since February, and estimates fair value for the stock at $38.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> More employers put 401(k) savings on autopilot </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Employers are increasingly putting retirement savings on autopilot for their workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , About 62% of businesses with a 401(k) plan used automatic enrollment in 2020, up from 60% the year prior and 46% a decade ago, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America, a trade group.                                                                                                                                                                                      , This feature lets an employer divert a portion of workers' paychecks into a 401(k), either immediately or after a few months, if that worker hasn't signed up voluntarily.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Auto-enrollment leverages worker behavior (inertia, in this case) to their advantage. Workers receive a paper or digital notification ahead of time and can opt out — but most do not.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Vanguard Group, one of the largest 401(k) providers, found that 92% of new hires were still saving in the 401(k) plan three years after being automatically enrolled; in plans with voluntary enrollment, just 29% were still saving.                                                                                                                                                , Companies are also beefing up the automated savings rate for workers, in a bid to help them build a bigger nest egg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Last year marked the first time more employers used a 6% "deferral" rate rather than 3%, which had been most common. (This is the share of a worker's paycheck that is saved automatically.)                                                                                                                                                                                         , A third of businesses with a 401(k) plan chose 6% in 2020, while 29% used that lower rate, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "I think there's just a recognition that 3% just won't get us to where we need to be in the long run," said Hattie Greenan, director of research at the Plan Sponsor Council of America.                                                                                                                                                                                             , The increased automation comes as Americans shoulder more individual responsibility for their retirement savings relative to past generations. Life spans are gradually rising, meaning a nest egg must last families a longer time. Almost half of Americans think their retirement savings isn't on track, according to the Federal Reserve.                                       , Businesses also have an incentive to boost workers' retirement savings. Financial security may mean greater productivity at work; it may also mean earlier retirements, which could equate to employer savings on health-care benefits, for example, which generally becomes costlier with older age.                                                                                , More from Personal Finance:Employers adding Roth 401(k) option at fast clipThere's still time to slash your 2021 tax billThe Santa Claus rally is your end-of-year gift from the stock market                                                                                                                                                                                        , Ten states have also created "auto-IRA" programs, according to the Georgetown University Center for Retirement Initiatives. These require employers to automatically enroll workers into a state-administered individual retirement account if they don't offer a 401(k) or other workplace retirement plan.                                                                         , (Four states — California, Connecticut, Illinois and Oregon — are currently active; Maryland and New Jersey are expected to launch their programs in 2022, for example, according to the Center.)                                                                                                                                                                                    , Financial planners and retirement services firms generally recommend people save at least 15% of their gross salary each year for retirement. (That total includes an employer 401(k) match.)                                                                                                                                                                                        , Research shows that raising an employee's deferral rate (to 6% instead of 3%, for example) doesn't generally cause workers to quit a 401(k) plan due to lower take-home pay.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , About 85% of workers earning between $15,000 and $30,000 a year participated in their 401(k) regardless of whether they were automatically enrolled at 2% or 6%, according to Vanguard.                                                                                                                                                                                              , However, the firm notes that 6% likely isn't a sufficient savings rate for most workers unless an employer also has a "very generous" match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Employers have automated other aspects of the plan, too, to help boost savings rates and overall 401(k) participation. Nearly 79% percent of plans with auto-enrollment also use "automatic escalation," a feature that gradually raises a worker's savings rate over time, generally once a year and up to a maximum rate. That share is up from 75% in 2019 and 68% five years ago., Most plans cap the rate at 10%, but there's been a shift toward higher rates, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America. Some employers may also automatically "sweep" all non-participating employees into their 401(k) each year, with the goal of keeping more workers in the plan over time.                                                                              , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tesla stock in danger of snapping win streak, while Argus Research analyst boosts price target by 30% - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Shares of Tesla Inc. 
        TSLA,
        -0.50%
       slipped 0.2% in midday trading Tuesday, paring earlier gains of as much as 2.3%, and putting them in danger of their first loss in five sessions. Meanwhile, Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky affirmed his buy rating and boosted his stock price target by 30%, to $1,313 from $1,010, citing an improved earnings outlook and as Chief Executive Elon Musk appears to have completed his stock sales. Selesky said Telsa is the "undisputed leader" in the electric vehicle industry, with "unparalleled" brand recognition. "Additionally, Tesla's recent announcement to open its Supercharger Network to other non-Tesla vehicles is a brilliant strategy, in our opinion, as Tesla not only has the largest fast-charging network in the world, which would benefit any EV owner, but it would also generate a new and potentially immense revenue stream in the years ahead by charging non-Tesla EV owners a fee for the use of a fast-charging Tesla Supercharger," Selesky wrote in a note to clients. Tesla's stock, which soared 21.6% during a four-day win streak through Monday, has run up 54.7% this year while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 27.3%., The global tally for COVID-19 rose to 281.5 million as of Tuesday morning and the death toll climbed to 5.41 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world with a total COVID-19 case count of 52.8 million and death toll of 818,371. On Monday, there were 543,415 new cases recorded, which boosted the 7-day average of new cases to 243,099, the most since Jan. 13, and more than double (105%) the average from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times tracker. The daily average was also the seventh-highest since the start of the pandemic. The continued spike in new cases comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cut its recommended quarantine time for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in half to five days if they are free of symptoms. Meanwhile, the daily average death toll slipped to 1,205 from 1,328 on Sunday, and the daily average of hospitalizations slipped to 71,381 from 71,459. Separately, the number of fully vaccinated in the U.S. crept up to 205.2 million, or 61.8% of the total population, according to CDC data, while 66.4 million Americans have received a booster dose.                     , Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Nello owner Thomas Makkos says people 'are very afraid to come out' of their homes and that the new strain has led to many cancellations with no end in sight.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , New York City restaurant owner Thomas Makkos noted that business has dropped by about 70% over the past two weeks because of fears related to the "very transmissible" omicron strain.                                                                                                                                                                                      , The owner of Nello, an Italian restaurant in Manhattan, told "Varney &amp; Co." on Tuesday that there have been "a lot of cancellations" as "people are very afraid to come out."                                                                                                                                                                                               , "It has created a huge vacuum of cancellations that keep on going," Makkos stressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-new-york-city                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , He added that the new coronavirus strain is adding challenges to an industry already battered by the virus and the mandates that were enforced in an effort to curb its spread.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Makkos provided the insight into the industry one day after New York City's vaccine mandate for private employers went into effect, as the largest city in the country looks to implement the strictest vaccine requirement on non-government employees yet.                                                                                                                , That means workers at every business in the city, no matter the size, must provide proof to their employer that they have received at least one vaccine dose, and proof of a second dose no later than 45 days after that. The requirement applies to contractors as well.                                                                                                  , NOVAVAX AT ‘TIPPING POINT’ WITH COVID VACCINE: CEO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , If they do not, the employer must ban them from the workplace or else the business could be subject to a "fine of $1,000 and escalating penalties thereafter if violations persist."                                                                                                                                                                                        , Celebrity chef and restaurateur Adrianne Calvo says inflation and labor shortages are contributing to the challenges experienced by the restaurant industry, noting most of the higher costs are being absorbed by owners.                                                                                                                                                  , Makkos stressed on Tuesday that the regulations in the city are "immensely" hurting business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , He said the regulations "were very strict from day one," especially for New York City restaurants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Makkos said Nello was closed for about seven months and then reopened initially at 25% capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "It was catastrophic," he said, regarding the loss in revenue. He stressed that while restaurants in the city were closed, some restaurants on Long Island were allowed to stay open, with those in Suffolk County doing "tremendous business."                                                                                                                             , Makkos argued that while New York City has been protecting people from COVID, another problem related to the economy has been exacerbated:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Restaurants are all in trouble. They owe landlords a lot of money," he said, arguing that those that remain open were likely given a "lifeline" by their landlords.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In a news release, the New York State Restaurant Association pointed to estimates from the National Restaurant Association that one out of every six restaurants in the country closed due to the pandemic and said that, based on estimates, that means more than 8000 restaurants in New York state, 4,500 of which are in New York City, have shut their doors for good. , "Way too many restaurants have not survived unfortunately," Makkos said on Tuesday, stressing that it has been "very difficult."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Nello owner Thomas Makkos argues New York City COVID mandates have been 'catastrophic' for restaurants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , He said that his restaurant has managed to survive due to its 25-year longevity in the neighborhood, calling it "internationally known."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "With that support, we were able to be here and hopefully we can navigate through for the next couple months," he added.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South Africa Stocks March Towards Record High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index rose 1.3% to close at 72,462, snapping two consecutive sessions with losses, and marching towards a record high of 72,939 hit on December 7th, tracking gains in global stock markets as market sentiment improved amid fading concerns about the omicron coronavirus variant. A new study from South Africa suggested that the Omicron strain limited chances of reinfection with the Delta variant, while papers released last week showed lower hospitalization rates and milder cases in patients infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant. On corporate news, the country’s health minister announced firms could hike factory gate prices of pharmaceuticals up to 3.5% in 2022. Last week, South Africa announced it would no longer require people exposed to the virus to quarantine, save for cases related to cluster outbreaks. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Nickel futures traded above $20,000 a tonne, not far from a one-month high of $20,384.5 hit on December 8th, amid a calm dollar, low inventories and expectations that policy easing in China would boost demand for industrial metals. Stockpiles of nickel in LME warehouses fell to 103,800 tonnes, the lowest since December 2019, and accumulating a fall of near 60% since January 4th. Also, the recent concerns over the impact of the new covid-19 variant in the global economy waned after studies showed that the omicron variant is less severe than previous strains, albeit more infectious, gearing up investors to bet that the economic recovery will not derail. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> What the oil market signals about omicron </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> John Catsimatidis, who runs the Gristedes grocery chain in New York and is also in the oil business, predicts there will be another wave of price increases in the first few months of 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Sometimes the oil market can be a predictor of future events. Could the rebound in oil signal the beginning of the end of the COVID plague?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Right after Thanksgiving, oil prices crashed on reports of omicron, a new variant of the COVID-19 virus. Crude oil prices went down on anticipation and fear that we could see the global economy shut down in an attempt to stop the spread of this new fast-spreading variant. Energy prices plunged into bear market territory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , OIL'S BEAR MARKET MAY BE A SHORT ONE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Yet now oil prices are surging back as it is clear that omicron will not shut down the global economy nor will it shut the U.S. economy, where we are still the world's biggest consumer of oil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , President Biden acknowledged as much, lowering fears of a COVID-19 shutdown, and said Monday, "There is no federal solution. This gets solved at the state level."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , In other words, a lockdown is off the table. Yet what may turn oil around are reports that people who catch the omicron variant might strengthen immunity against the earlier delta strain of the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , COVID TEST MAKER RAMPS UP PRODUCTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , This could be big news for oil demand. Historians and scientists say that viruses that cause pandemics often mutate to become less life-threatening. The devastating 1918 Spanish flu pandemic reportedly ended as more people became exposed to the virus and the strains became less life-threatening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Bloomberg News reported. "While omicron has been shown to be highly transmissible and can evade some antibodies, after two weeks of getting symptoms immunity to subsequent infections from the strain rose 14-fold, according to the authors led by Alex Sigal and Khadija Khan of the Durban, South Africa-based Africa Health Research Institute. A smaller improvement was found against delta," it continued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , And while it is too early to say that this is the end of the pandemic, it does suggest that the odds of an extended open global lockdown of economies is unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , What it also means for oil traders is that the selloff we saw in oil was way overdone based upon the reality of what has happened. Because oil producers may have cut back a bit due to lower prices and buyers of oil slowed their purchases on fears of demand destruction, it could leave us caught short so the ensuing rally in oil could send prices higher than would have been if there had been no omicron scare at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Phil Flynn is senior energy analyst at The PRICE Futures Group and a Fox Business Network contributor.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks turned mixed on Tuesday amid low liquidity and as traders continue to weigh the impact the omicron coronavirus variant will have on the economy. The S&amp;P 500 swung between small gains and losses after hitting a fresh record high on Monday, the Dow was up as much as 100 points, while the Nasdaq fell as much as 0.5%. Global Covid-19 cases hit a daily record yesterday with many countries imposing restrictions and several studies suggesting the new strain is highly contagious but causes less severe illness. On the corporate front, UnitedHealth (0.7%) and Tesla (1%) were among the top performers. It will be a soft week in terms of economic releases but stocks typically rise in the last days of the year, the so-called “Santa Claus rally”. So far in the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 27.6%, the Nasdaq 23.1%, and the Dow Jones 18.6%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB held to earlier gains to close 0.8% higher at 27,444.93, the highest in five weeks and in line with its European counterparts, as investors resist the spread of the Omicron variant. The Italian government revamped quarantine rules for individuals who have come into close contact with the virus, extending the time to seven days for the vaccinated and ten days for the unvaccinated. While not announcing any lockdowns, policymakers have already banned public New Year’s Eve events and mandated outdoor mask usage, as the country’s daily case count is at an all-time high. On the corporate front, utility stocks (1.4%) rose the most, led by A2a (2.1%) after the regional utility agreed to buy a majority stake of Volta Green Energy. Hera (1.8%) and Italgas (2.1%) also booked gains. </td>

A new study from South Africa suggested that the Omicron strain limited chances of reinfection with the Delta variant, while papers released last week showed lower hospitalization rates and milder cases in patients infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant. Travel &amp; leisure, healthcare, and industrial stocks led gains, with most sectors also ending in positive territory. Meanwhile, markets in the UK and Ireland remained closed for holidays. </td>

After last trading session, Prime Minister Jean Castex dismissed strict lockdowns, but announced the return to remote work for three weeks starting January 3rd, mandatory vaccinations to enter various cultural facilities and events, and that the deadline for booster shots was lowered to three months. On the corporate front, utilities stocks rose 1.3%, in line with its European peers, driven by Veolia (2.7%).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Platinum futures rose to a 4-weeks high above $970 per troy ounce in the fourth week of December, in line with gold and silver as investors continue to worry over the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Global Covid-19 cases hit a daily record on Monday, after last week some studies suggested lower hospitalization rates and less severe symptoms for those infected with the Omicron variant when compared to the Delta variant. Although it is expected that platinum prices will increase in the long-term, the commodity is poised to post an over 8% loss this year, due to lower demand amid the current shortage of semiconductor chips. Oversupply concerns mounted after the World Platinum Investment Council said in November the global platinum market would see large surpluses this year and the next. </td>

However, the figure marks a slowdown from the 19.1% year-over-year growth in September and came in below Refinitiv's 18.5% growth estimate.                                                                                                                                          , In addition, Case Shiller's national home price index, which covers all nine U.S. census divisions, reported a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% in the previous month, while the 10-city composite increased 17.1% year-over-year, down from 17.9% in the previous month.                                                                                                                                                                           , HOOVER, ALABAMA, REAL ESTATE: WHAT YOU CAN GET FOR $1M                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Before seasonal adjustment, the U.S. national index posted a 0.8% month-over-month increase in October, while the 10-City and 20-City Composites both posted increases of 0.8%. After seasonal adjustment, the U.S. national index posted a month-over-month increase of 1%, and the 10-City and 20-City Composites posted increases of 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively.                                                                                             , Phoenix, Tampa, and Miami led the 20-city index with the highest year-over-year gains in October, coming in at 32.3%, 28.1% and 25.7% respectively. Minneapolis and Chicago posted the smallest increases of 11.5% each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Six of the 20 cities reported higher price increases in the year ending October 2021 versus the year ending September 2021.

Many Americans, tired of being cooped up at home during the pandemic, are looking to trade up from apartments to homes or to bigger houses.                                                                                                                             , "We have previously suggested that the strength in the U.S. housing market is being driven in part by a change in locational preferences as households react to the COVID pandemic," S&amp;P DJI managing director Craig Lazzara said in a statement. "More data will be required to understand whether this demand surge represents an acceleration of purchases that would have occurred over the next several years, or reflects a more permanent secular change.", Last week, mortgage rates fell to 3.05% for the benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate and 2.66% for the 15-year fixed-rate home loan. The persistently low rates signal that credit markets appear more concerned about the omicron variant depressing economic growth than about the highest inflation rates in nearly 40 years.                                                                                                                                        , The National Association of Realtors reported last week that sales of previously occupied homes rose for the third straight month in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.46 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Associated Press contributed to this report </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tin futures traded just around $39,200 a tonne at the end of December, marching towards a one-month high of $39,500 hit on December 9th, amid low inventories and supply disruptions. The inventories in the LME-warehouses dropped to 1,365 tonnes, the lowest since 1989 while the ShFE stocks are near a five-year low. Also, measures to curb Covid's spread in Myanmar have caused shipment disruptions, restricting refined tin output in China. Meantime, the third-biggest refined tin producer, Malaysia Smelting Group, declared force majeure on deliveries in June, while Chinese tin smelters reduced the output after curbs on power consumption. </td>

According to Chinese state media, Beijing vowed to stabilize grain acreage and production for 2022, easing worries of food inflation and shortages that were prevalent this year, while reducing the dependence on Russian exports. Elsewhere, the USDA inspected 271,349 tonnes of wheat for export last week, which was on the lower end of the estimated range. At the same time, data from the Commitment of Traders indicated non-commercial investors increased their short position on wheat. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Mexican peso traded around 20.60 per USD at the end of December, the strongest since November 12th, amid higher oil prices and as concerns over the Omicron waned. Investors’ risk appetite increased despite rising Covid cases and new restrictions as studies showed that the new variant is less severe than previous strains, albeit more infectious. The crude prices, a major Mexican export, extended the recent rally to over $76 a barrel, increasing more than 10% from the recent low of $68.61 on December 20th. Also, in its last meeting, the Banxico surprised the markets and hiked the rates by 50 bps to 5.5%, above expectations of 25 bps saying inflation risk balance has deteriorated, with both the headline inflation and the core inflation expectations for the next year increasing again, and the ones for the medium-term remaining above the target. </td>

       hiked up 2.9% in morning trading Tuesday, after the Maryland-based biotechnology company and vaccine manufacture Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. said Novavax's protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, Covovax, has been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in India by the Drugs Controller General of India. The vaccine will be made and marketed in India by Serum. Novavax's vaccine has previously received EUA in Indonesia and the Philippines, has received Emergency Use Listing with the World Health Organization and has been granted Conditional Marketing Authorization by the European Commission under the name Nuvaxovid. Novavax expects to submit a complete package to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its vaccine by the end of the year. "The approval of Covovax in India marks a significant milestone in strengthening our immunization efforts across India and LMICs [low-to-middle-income countries]," said Serum Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla. "We are proud to deliver a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, based on Phase 3 clinical data demonstrating more than 90% efficacy and a favorable safety profile, to our nation."

Meanwhile, England will not impose any new Covid restrictions before the end of 2021, British health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South Africa's rand weakened past 15.7 against the USD on Tuesday, erasing an over one-month high of 15.53 reached last session, as investors continue to monitor the impact of the Omicron variant on the economy. A Bloomberg survey revealed economists were less optimistic about the recovery of South Africa, revising lower the country’s 2021 growth to 4.9% from a prior estimate of 5.1% amid concerns about the latest virus wave. On the other hand, a new study from South Africa suggested that the Omicron strain limited chances of reinfection with the Delta variant, while papers released last week showed lower hospitalization rates and milder cases in patients infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant. Looking ahead, South African Reserve Bank policymakers voiced concerns over South Africa’s economic growth outlook, amid rising inflation, weaker commodity export prices, stagnant investment, and the long term impact of the pandemic and the July unrest. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index in the US rose 18.4% year-on-year in October of 2021, easing for a third consecutive month and slightly below forecasts of 18.5%. Phoenix (32.3%), Tampa (28.1%), and Miami (25.7%) recorded the highest annual increases.

The national index, covering all nine US census divisions, reported a 19.1% annual gain, down from 19.7% in the previous month. House prices have surged in 2021 and rose at a record 20% in July amid a change in locational preferences as households react to the COVID pandemic, low mortgage-interest rates and a limited supply of homes </td>

Meanwhile, there is growing uncertainty of Italy’s political future. Prime Minister Mario Draghi is the leading candidate to assume the country’s presidency when the seat becomes available in January, a move that could trigger early parliamentary elections after his 10-month administration. At the same time, investors worry that Italy’s debt-ridden economy could trigger a much higher risk premium for debt instruments in January, when the European Central Bank reduces its stimulus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Riot Games, the studio best known for League of Legends, has agreed to pay $100m (£74.3m) to settle a 2018 class-action gender discrimination case.                                                                                                                                             , The settlement will "remedy violations against approximately 1,065 women employees and 1,300 women contract workers", California's Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing (DFEH) wrote.                                                                                                        , DFEH said the firm engaged in "systemic sex discrimination and harassment".

                                                                                                                                                                                , According to the original complaint against the company, Riot was accused of fostering a "bro culture" and faced a range of allegations.

and that unsolicited images of male genitalia had been shown to workers by their bosses and colleagues.                                                        , As part of the settlement, Riot agreed to workplace reforms, independent expert analysis of its pay, hiring, and promotion practices, and to be monitored for instances of sexual harassment and "retaliation" at its California offices for three years.                                       , The company must also set aside $18m (13.2m) to fund diversity, equity and inclusion programmes and create 40 full-time positions in engineering, quality assurance or art-design roles for its former contract workers.                                                                        , DFEH Director Kevin Kish wrote that, if accepted by the court, the settlement would lead to lasting change at Riot Games and "send the message that all industries in California, including the gaming industry, must provide equal pay and workplaces free from discrimination and harassment"., Riot had initially agreed to settle the case for $10m in 2019, but the DFEH and another agency had blocked the deal arguing that the amount to which victims were entitled was much higher.                                                                                                     , The company said it had to face the fact that it hadn't always lived up to its values, telling the Washington Post: "While we're proud of how far we've come since 2018, we must also take responsibility for the past".                                                                        , "We hope that this settlement properly acknowledges those who had negative experiences at Riot."

right thing to do, for both the company and those whose experiences at Riot fell short of our standards and values".                                                                                , The company told the BBC that since 2018 it had made improvements across the workplace, including hiring its first chief people officer and its first chief diversity officer, rewriting its values, mandating new training programmes and enlarging its diversity and inclusion team.          , Riot Games is not the only prominent games firm to face questions about workplace culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The DFEH is also taking action against Activision Blizzard, the company behind the games World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Call of Duty.

claims of sexual discrimination and harassment.                                                                                                                , How many can you recognise by sound

He said the government would reassess whether more measures were needed in the new year.                                                                                         , Mr Eustice said "if we do see a big increase in hospital admissions" then ministers would have to act.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Pubs, bars and restaurants have been hard hit in the run-up to Christmas, due to mass cancellations over Omicron variant fears.                                                                                                                                                                                  , UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the decision to not go beyond Plan B measures in England would give "a real lifeline" to many.                                                                                                                                                                 , But there are also calls for more support - Adnams brewery boss Andy Wood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more than half of Christmas business had been lost.                                                                                                                                                , Some scientists think the decision not to introduce new curbs before the new year is "probably fine", with data showing "very low" numbers of vaccinated people in intensive care.                                                                                                                               , Prof Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University told the Today programme: "The horrific scenes that we saw a year ago - intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely - that is now history in my view and I think we should reassured that that's likely to continue.", He said while there had been an increase in the number of people admitted to hospital with Covid in London - 364 were admitted on Christmas Day - it had remained below 400 per day, a marker Sir John said had been watched for.                                                                                , Staff quarantining was putting additional stress on the health service, he said, and lateral flow tests were "quite a good way" of showing who was infectious - rather than cutting isolation periods as has been done in the US.                                                                                , Restrictions do not stop Covid, they just buy time by delaying its spread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Last winter that time was used to rollout the vaccine programme, which meant when cases started to rise as restrictions were lifted the population was better protected.                                                                                                                                         , Given the extent of the booster rollout - nine in 10 of the most vulnerable have had one - we are about as well protected as we can be.                                                                                                                                                                          , So the argument for restrictions is more about spreading out the pressure on the NHS and wider economy given high rates of infection leads to lots of people isolating.

Exports rose by 4.5 percent from a month earlier, boosted by sales of base metals (21%), precious metals and stones (13%), and vehicles and transport equipment (11%). On the other hand, exports were down for both vegetable products (-30%) and mineral products (-11%). Main export partners were the US (10.9% of total sales), China (10.4%), Germany (6.7%), Japan (6%), and the UK (5.3%). Imports dropped 0.9 percent, due to falling purchases of original equipment components (-42%) and wood pulp and paper (-21%).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Jackson, Mississippi (CNN)Around Thanksgiving, this crisis-plagued state capital saw a series of shootings that pushed the year's homicide total past 130, setting a grim annual record for a city that over the last two years has quietly become one of the country's deadliest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The killings, like so many in another record-setting year of American gun violence, are not the kind that receive national attention. A local business owner was shot outside a barbershop while sitting in his car. A few days later, a man was killed in a shooting that also wounded a 13-year-old boy. A 22-year-old inside a car was sprayed with gunfire at a gas station. A 63-year-old man whose death by gunfire is still largely unexplained.                                                                                                                                           , In the state's most populous city, a former Confederate stronghold that would later give way to thriving Black business districts and serve as a hub for the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, residents are now grappling with a gun violence epidemic that spiked at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and shows no signs of abating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "We see lifelong friends kill each other, we've seen a son kill his mother and sister, have seen crimes that are based on social determinants and an inability of people to be engaged in institutions in which they thrive," Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN during a tour of the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The rising gun violence has further exposed the city's deep-rooted social and political problems, none with easy or tidy solutions. And everyone working against this wave -- from the city's civic, law enforcement, faith, and street outreach communities -- is competing not just with spiraling violence, but with a pandemic that laid bare all of society's inequities when it became ever more difficult to address them.                                                                                                                                                                 , There have already been 150 homicides this year through December 21, according to police, nearly all of them shootings. The city's homicide rate is 97.6 murders per 100,000 residents, 15 times higher than the US rate of 6.5, most resulting from gunfire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "When you get up to 80 per 100,000 in a city with more than 100,000 people you're dealing with a vanishingly small number of places with homicide rates that high," said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , To put the numbers into perspective, in 2020 St. Louis was the country's deadliest large city, cataloguing 87 homicides per 100,000, "and that was clearly at the top of the list of larger cities," Rosenfeld said. "Jackson is now exceeding that level."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , For nearly every major American city, the end of spring in 2020 marked the beginning of an historic wave of homicides. By the end of the year, homicides were up by 29% from 2019, the largest year-over-year increase ever recorded by the FBI. Across much of the country, homicides spiked over the summer, following the Memorial Day murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , That heightened violence has continued through 2021 for many large cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , More than two-thirds of the country's most populous cities have seen more homicides in 2021 than last year, a continuation of the troubling increase in homicides that began at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, according to a CNN analysis of over 40 major cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Jackson, a solidly Democratic city in a state that is solidly Republican, shattered its homicide record in 2020 with 130 -- the previous high of 92 homicides in 1995, about the time when homicides in America peaked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The city's challenged public institutions, including the police department, parks and social services, all faced immeasurable strain during the pandemic. Earlier this year, Jackson gained national attention when it joined the list of impoverished American cities where crumbling infrastructure gave wake to unsafe drinking water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Mississippi is an open carry state                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , All of this came to a head in March 2020, when lockdowns began across the country. It's impossible to ignore the role that guns play: city officials, police officers of different ranks, and outreach workers have all cited the ease of obtaining guns, their open display and availability during high-stress times, and the inability of police to act when they see a gun as contributing factors for the spike in homicides.                                                                                                                                                                , Mississippi's gun laws are among the most permissive in the country. In 2013, the state's heavily Republican legislature made Mississippi an open carry state, meaning that anyone over the age of 18 can carry a handgun or rifle anywhere they choose without a permit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But in April 2020, Mayor Lumumba was worried that a mix of pandemic-induced toxic stress and the proliferation of guns might lead to an uptick in violence, and so he issued an executive order banning the open display of guns in public in the city's 113 square miles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In his address, Lumumba cited the shooting deaths of two children  weeks earlier, neither of whom were intended targets. Lumumba reviewed the body-worn camera footage from one shooting where a 5-year-old girl was killed, and was struck by the trauma of it all -- the victim, the victim's family, the officer who found her -- and noted he had a child the same age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "I had a 5-year-old at home at that time ... And that baby was doing the same thing that my baby was: playing on an iPad."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , He declared the order  "necessary for the protection of life and property in this moment of great distress and economic tension."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But it immediately put Lumumba at odds with other government officials, who were swift to condemn both the mayor and the policy. The state's attorney general asked Lumumba to reconsider. Days after the announcement, the city council denounced the ban  in a symbolic vote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The order was short-lived and was not renewed. The city council agreed to ban any further attempts to limit open carry, and the US District Attorney for Southern Mississippi called the ban a "publicity stunt" in a tweet. In June, a federal judge ruled that Jackson could not ban the open carry of firearms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In a YouTube address announcing the order, Lumumba said he had "no principled disagreement with the Second Amendment," but he believed that  open carry "escalates conflict beyond the point of resolution." He also cited the stress that came with the economy grinding to a halt, and the sense of fear and intimidation that open carry allowed during what was an unprecedented time. He had faith in the idea that taking guns from people who shouldn't have them would limit their potential for damage.                                                                                  , The open carry limitation only lasted days, and an escalation of violence continued. By mid-July 2020, the city had surpassed 2019's homicide totals. The violence has not abated since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Community leaders point to the pandemic's erosion of Jackson's already frayed social safety net, saying that the pandemic-caused closure of community institutions like churches, parks and other services almost certainly contributed to the uptick in violence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Lorenzo Neal, a pastor at New Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jackson, said kids who used to play at a park across from his church and sit on his steps to use the WiFi don't come around anymore, even though the parks have reopened. In the middle of the summer, in the middle of the day, the parks were empty. He worries about the development of children who've been exposed to violence, even if they haven't themselves been victimized.                                                                                                                                  , "It's affected how they operate [in] school, and how they function in school is affected, how they relate to their families, and how they relate to their other friends," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Drastic demographic changes in the city                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Jackson, a largely Black metropolis in a state with the largest share of Black residents in the country, has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , These shifts began in the 1970s, when Jackson was mandated to desegregate its schools following a 1969 Supreme Court ruling. The case came a decade and a half after Brown v. Board of Education, but Mississippi schools had been slow to comply until the 1969 ruling, which marked a turning point in the city's trajectory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Following the decision, Jackson lost 10,000 White students to nearby suburbs or new private schools set up by  "citizens'  councils," segregationist groups formed in response to the Supreme Court decision ending school segregation. Their membership often overlapped with the Ku Klux Klan, according to Robert Luckett, historian at Jackson State University.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The ruling also coincided with multiple blows to Black economic opportunity: Lynch Street, a Black business district, was closed after police killed two people during protests that erupted over the rumor of a civil rights leader's murder and against the war in Vietnam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The '70s also marked a downturn in Jackson's Farish Street district, once a destination for Black southerners barred from White-owned stores and an early source of Black wealth in Jackson. Luckett says that as the city became more integrated -- especially following the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 -- the area declined, as Black residents began to spend their money elsewhere and White residents began to move to the suburbs.                                                                                                                                             , By the '80s, many of the stores on Farish Street closed and efforts to revitalize the district came in fits and starts. Now the area lies mostly abandoned, though it's been the target of redevelopment efforts over the years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , In the 1980s, Jackson changed its form of government from two elected commissioners and a mayor to a city council system with a seven-member council and a mayor. This changed the form of government from one where three people were elected citywide to one with the city carved into seven city council districts, which led to greater representation for women and Black people in government and marked the beginning of drastic demographic changes.                                                                                                                                      , "People in the city of Jackson were demanding that they have some representation, and until that time ... it was guaranteed that as long as the city was majority White and people who voted were majority White, it was guaranteed to elect three White men in a city that was majority Black or close to it," Luckett said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The city's population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city's residents were Black.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "People who left were people who have means to do so. Not everyone can pick up and move to the suburbs," Luckett said. "Losing tax base, losing property values. And (the city was) dealing with state government based in Jackson that, because of those factors, was increasingly hostile to city of Jackson."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Changes in power and demographics led to the election of the city's first Black mayor in 1997 -- by 2000, the White population of Jackson had dropped by 16% from the previous decade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Inside city hall, photos of the previous mayors line a grand staircase, with the White mayors on one side and Black mayors on the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Neither of the two Black business districts survived into the '90s and 2000s, and neither did the downtown district. A stretch of Lynch Street was absorbed by Jackson State University and the other two still have buildings but many are vacant. Over the years, the city continued in a slow, spiraling decline of population and ability to deliver and maintain basic services. The decline has been protracted, painful -- stores in the city's only mall closed one by one before the shopping center finally closed for good in 2018. The city hasn't had an open movie theater in years., The median income in Jackson has also rapidly dwindled, while neighboring suburban communities have grown wealthier over time. More than a quarter of the city's population lives below the poverty line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Much of the city's White flight appears to have been to nearby Madison County, where the population has doubled since 1990, and it was the only county in Jackson's metropolitan area with a greater percentage of White people in 2019 than 1990.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Community members say a lack of social services, jobs and resources can make violence seem like a viable option for teens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "(There's) no economic growth, nowhere to work. Nowhere. A young person can only work at a fast-food restaurant," said Timothy Finch, a violence interrupter in Jackson. "If I can't work, what am I going to do? I sit at home all day. Idle time makes an idle mind."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Finch said he and another violence interrupter approached two kids recently who were sitting on a brick wall near a park, thinking they were scheming either to snatch a woman's purse or break into a car.  When they approached the kids, they confirmed Finch's suspicions almost without hesitation. But he understands the impulse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "There's nothing for them to do," he said. "Being in Jackson, man, it's almost like being in prison. Only difference is that instead of being in my zone or in my cell all day, the whole city is the cell ... Just like a big jail house, nobody's doing nothing."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , It can take hours for police to respond                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Jackson's decline has also weakened its police force, and the pandemic has only accelerated the challenges the department faces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The police department, like much of the city's infrastructure, has suffered. The city recently raised starting pay for new police officers to  $30,000 per year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , As the city's population has withered and its tax revenues declined, the department shrunk from a peak of more than 520 officers to about 290  in 2021. Another 20%  of officers are retirement eligible.  And though the department is budgeted up to 350 officers, it's a struggle keeping up with attrition, attracting and training new recruits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "When I came on in the 90s, law enforcement was a very appealing job," said Assistant Chief Joseph Wade. "At certain points, we'd have an application pool of 200 to 300, now it's 50 or 60 people we're having to vet for recruit classes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The city is competing with higher-paying departments in the nearby bedroom communities that grew as Jackson contracted. Those communities make up about two-thirds of the metro area's total population. They also have less crime and calls for service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Because Jackson is so large, and police staffing is so light, it's not surprising for calls to take hours to get to -- a single major incident could draw three or four officers in a precinct that might have only a dozen officers working, and calls stack up. And when residents call 911 and an officer doesn't arrive for hours, it breeds mistrust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The police department recently opened a new command center, but with the troubles staffing the department in general, it's difficult to meet basic public safety obligations, let alone fully utilize the new technology center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Reliance on 'credible messenger' program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , While Jackson's understaffed police force certainly has a role to play in crime reduction, the mayor says they can't bear the sole responsibility for the city's ongoing crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "I think you're working behind an 8-ball if you think you can out-police crime," Lumumba said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Organizers, advocates, and politicians all emphasize outreach and community-based solutions for long-term, sustainable violence reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "Every block is going to be organized by somebody, right? It's either going to be organized by a positive force or negative force," Lumumba said. So much of outreach work is just showing kids something different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , These types of programs once existed -- and thrived -- in Jackson. The National Youth Sports Program, which ran at 200 colleges for children in impoverished areas, allowed kids a place to be with their friends each summer, and created continuity and stability in their life during a time when violence usually spikes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The program also guaranteed kids at least one FDA-approved meal each day of camp, but most days the staff also ensured kids got hot breakfasts and an afternoon snack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "[After] five weeks, kids would be crying knowing it was over. That's how connected these programs were with kids and the staff we hired," said Rochelle Taylor, who served as president of the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , It ran from 1969 to 2005, and when funding looked like it would run out, a plea from a local newspaper spoke to its need, saying, "Senators must be aware how crucial this program is to the well being of so many underserved young people. It will cost society more to remove the safety netting that our National Youth Sports Program provides."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Now, initiatives in Jackson focus on violence interruption, a tactic that uses known members of the community to de-escalate conflict before it turns violent. The success of these programs can vary. Locally, well-respected messengers can help negotiate a truce or somehow otherwise stand in the way of warring groups.  But violence interrupters have not yet led to a total, sustainable crime reduction across an entire city.                                                                                                                                                          , Strong Arms of JXN, a community organization formed by Benny Ivey and Terun Moore, aims to reach kids early in life. The program is affiliated with the People's Advocacy Institute, a Mississippi-based community engagement nonprofit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ivey rose to leadership in the Simon City Royals, a gang rooted in Chicago and now one of the largest White gangs in the Mississippi prison system. Moore killed a man in 1998, was convicted when he was 17 years old, and was paroled out after the US Supreme Court ruled mandatory life-without-parole unconstitutional and the state  supreme court ordered a new sentencing hearing.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Strong Arms of JXN is a "credible messenger" program,  a term used to describe violence interruption and other street-level outreach work. Such methods can be controversial because they rely on someone's criminal or gang history to reach young people who are either flirting with or actively involved in crime.  The group's activities range from museum tours to court-ordered after school programs.                                                                                                                                                                                    , These programs face an uphill climb to success. It's not just about connecting with the kids -- they need wide buy-in from institutions often with different goals, including juvenile courts, police stations, hospitals and schools. But once that credibility is established, the relationships may last years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , What foothold Strong Arms of JXN has now is by the approval of Judge Carlyn Hicks, whose court orders some kids into the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "It didn't take a whole lot of convincing for me to be collaborative and responsive, as opposed to reactive, to (a child's) actions," said Hicks, who authorized the program in juvenile detention and as an intervention program for teens who've been arrested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Every child in her jurisdiction tried as an adult has a child protective services history, Hicks said.  Unaddressed trauma turns into other behaviors, and juvenile delinquents may graduate to more serious violent crimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "Data will show, studies will show, statistics will show, that if we don't have meaningful intervention at that stage, there will be manifestation of (violence) in the future."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , While community organizers work toward long-term solutions, Jackson city officials are scrambling to find something to stem the violence happening right now. At the beginning of November, Lumumba convened a multi-agency summit for community leaders to discuss solutions, but the event was closed to the press and public. Since then, community leaders have hosted several other forums in the city's wards.                                                                                                                                                                              , Just before Christmas 2021, Strong Arms of JXN got keys to a former community center in South Jackson that sat unused. It will serve as an anchor for the program. Ivey, one of the co-directors, said he's already ordered PlayStations and other provisions to make the space an inviting one for teens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "We're excited. We've been trying to do this spot to spot, it's not as effective. We need to be able to hunker down in one area, it's disintegrated more than any part of the city the last several years, and that's where we want to be anyway," Ivey said. "I don't believe in coincidences. I believe God gave us that."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent Breaks Above $79 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures rose more than 1% to above $79 per barrel on Tuesday, the highest in over four weeks as investors shrugged off concerns that the omicron variant will dampen global demand after studies last week suggested lower hospitalization rates and the availability of more treatment options. Mobility numbers were strong over the holiday weekend despite the cancellation of thousands of flights by US airlines caused by Covid-related staff shortages. Meanwhile, England will not impose any new Covid restrictions before the end of 2021, British health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday. Oil prices gained more than 50% this year due to the return of demand and supply cuts by major oil-producing countries. Markets now zero in on the next OPEC+ meeting on Jan. 4, as the group is set to decide whether to go ahead with a planned 400,000 barrels per day production increase in February. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The trade deficit in Hong Kong narrowed to HKD 11.6 billion in November of 2021 from HKD 25.6  billion a year earlier. Exports jumped 25% to HKD 474.4 billion, mainly driven by sales of electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances, and related parts (30.2%); office machines and automatic data processing machines (48.3%); and telecommunications and sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment (13.6%). Shipments rose primarily to Mainland China (24.1%), the US (32.2%), Japan (11.5%), and Taiwan (63.0%). Meanwhile, imports advanced a slower 20% to HKD 486.0 billion, driven mostly by electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances, and related parts (21.2%); miscellaneous manufactured goods (50.6%); and office machines and automatic data processing machines (37.5%).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cotton futures on ICE traded close to 112 USd/Lbs, the highest since November 29th amid firm demand and tight supplies caused by shipping woes. Inventories at ICE US monitored depots fell to all-time lows, slumping by almost 99% this year. Meanwhile, the USDA in its December report estimated 2021/22 global production to drop by 200,000 bales as a 1.0 million bale drop in Pakistan more than offset gains in Benin, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Cameroon. Also, world cotton ending stocks were projected 1.2 million bales lower due to lower beginning stocks, smaller production and slightly higher consumption. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the French 10-year OAT rose to 0.15%, the highest in 8 weeks, as fading concerns on the economic impact of the pandemic heightened risk appetite and shifted investors to equities. In the final week of December, the French benchmark stock index rose to a fresh record, erasing losses from the end of November. Investors continue to look at the Omicron variant as less dangerous than previous variants, as preliminary data from South Africa, England, and Scotland indicate lower hospitalization rates for those infected with the novelty variant when compared to the Delta variant. In the meantime, French authorities tightened restrictions against unvaccinated individuals, but signalled that strict lockdowns and restrictions on business were to be avoided. </td>

Investors’ sentiment was upbeat amid reports that Omicron, although more infectious, is less severe than the delta variant.

It was the highest producer inflation since June of 2018 as prices accelerated for intermediate goods (9.33 percent vs 8.55 percent in October) and consumer goods (4.65 percent vs 4.30 percent), particularly non-durable consumer goods (4.98 percent vs 4.6 percent). Meanwhile, prices eased for capital goods (1.75 percent vs 1.83 percent) while remained steady for energy.

A recent study suggests that the odds of someone infected with the omicron strain being reinfected with the more aggressive delta variant is limited, which could reduce the presence of the latter in the world. Earlier studies had shown lower hospitalization rates and milder symptoms in those infected with omicron. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US gasoline futures rallied past $2.2 per gallon, the highest since November 25th amid fading concerns about the omicron variant despite news that several airlines canceled thousands of flights due to COVID-related staff shortages. Earlier, the American Automobile Association forecasted that more than 100 million Americans were hitting the roads during this holiday season, 28% more than last year. For this year, gasoline prices rose almost 60% on stronger demand and faltering crude oil supply. The pandemic was brought under control in major economies with the help of vaccines, enabling the lifting of travel restrictions. In late October, gasoline prices reached a 7-year high of $2.52 amid shrinking domestic inventories, as OPEC+ sticked to the planned 400,000 bpd monthly output increases despite mounting international pressure to match market demand. </td>

While not announcing any lockdowns, policymakers have already banned public New Year’s Eve events and mandated outdoor mask usage, as the country’s daily case count is at an all-time high.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY instead of guessing around magic crayon lines, it&amp;#39;s easier to just trade probabilities. If you look at a weekly chart, most bars are flat to green. Simple enough, right? Say once a week, you sell 1 ATM Put Credit Spread, that&amp;#39;s about $45 dollar max profit, $55 max loss. You enter the trade at market open on whichever expiration day you choose. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter where the market&amp;#39;s at. Just enter the fcking trade. Forget about it for a week. If u have to put a GTC order to avoid max loss, feel free. Chances are, you make money over time. That Put credit spread will *more often than not* expire worthless. You&amp;#39;ll get a loser here and there, but the losses are capped and won&amp;#39;t hurt you much whenever the &amp;quot;big one&amp;quot; comes. I like to trade these with a 1-2% max loss.

I know the last few months haven’t been very impressive but honestly, I couldn’t care less. I simply do what I must to protect our capital and I don’t care if it doesn’t pay off right away. We could’ve been severely hit by holding innovative growth with Cathie, we could&amp;#39;ve been hit by China, we could’ve been hit –50% by small caps, we could’ve been hit by chasing crypto at the wrong times, we could’ve been hit by buying meme stocks at the wrong time, etc. etc. So many things could’ve gone wrong and have gone wrong for so many investors this year. But so far, I’m very happy with my returns and let’s make next year even better, cheers! 🍻 </td>

Usually, investors can beat the market by investing in growth stocks (like innovative growth names + smaller caps) but this year it’s been very rough for that specific sector of the market. The only way you could&amp;#39;ve beaten the market this year is if you allocated to growth earlier this year when it was overperforming (in January and February) and then got out in Feb-March when everything started to tank. Oh wait.. that’s exactly what we did. Study my history for proof. I didn’t rotate everything in one shot, but I did start rotating into safer plays right around February when yields were peaking. And that’s exactly where growth and small caps peaked as well. I did take a hit, you can see it in my portfolio’s performance (there was a decline in mid-February) but instead of going down for the rest of the year like small caps and ARKK ETF, my rotation kept my account running higher for the rest of the year and I’m still currently overperforming the market by several miles. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Here’s a comparison of my Portfolio’s return vs Cathie Wood’s $ARKK ETF for the year of 2021 so far. 

The reason why I’m comparing my results with Cathie, is because not many other traders are 100% transparent with their trades. So we don’t have a choice, we need to compare our results with popular benchmarks like ARKK, Berkshire, the S&amp;amp;P 500, etc. 

Portfolio performance: 109% 

ARKK: -21.75% 

Whenever the $SPY has a return of 25%+ in 1 year, there’s absolutely no excuse for your portfolio to underperform by this much. Anyone who has a negative % return this year should truly re-evaluate their entire investing strategy (I’m just being honest). I do admit that the broader market was very difficult to beat this year because if you look around, you’ll quickly realize that basically nothing outperformed the mega tech stocks (FAANG) this year. </td>

That was expecting a bad holiday season?

And what&amp;#39;s so wrong if holiday sales were -1% or 4% , what, with inflation 7% , I mean, why in the world add fuel to the fire by putting money into market so that inflation now goes to 10% .

And be certain, that 8.5% holiday sales # will bump CPI a minimum of 1% and more likely 1.5-2.

The answer isn’t simply “tech”.. DOW is also up 27% and Russel 35%. I have to imagine that some of the reason is that investors prefer holding USD in times of crisis, but that can’t explain everything. Other countries, like Canada, pumped far more money into their economy than the US (on a GDP % or per capita basis), yet the TSX increased a modest 23%. Could it just be that US market are inflated.. perhaps more speculation, fomo and new/naive investors? </td>

BREAKING NEWS

The U.S. is averaging 267,000 daily coronavirus cases, a record as two highly contagious variants converge and threaten to overwhelm hospitals. 

Tuesday, December 28, 2021 9:45 PM EST

The record came just a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced the number of days that infected Americans should remain isolated to five days, from 10. The C.D.C. changed course as Omicron’s rapid spread has worsened a labor shortage, upending the hospitality, medical and travel industries, among others.

Do. Not. Buy. Shit. From. People. On. Here.

This dude is not going to 1000x his investment in 3 months. He is not going to show you how to do 1000x your investment for the whopping $60.00/month he charges. He is not some experienced trader that will give you golden inside info and insight and is as simply straight up scam as they come. 

It is insane that people like this are real. If his methods worked he’d be a trillionaire by SEPTEMBER lol. Just don’t. Making money investing should NEVER cost you money. Block people like this and never look back.

If you talked to the right people from 2015-2019, you&amp;#39;d know that behind the scenes, they were totally frustrated at the low inflation rate.  There was a growing call to action. 
 
Fast forward to today, and without the ploy (a slightly revised strain of the flu re-branded as the new plague), there definitely would be mass riots and protests.  How else can you explain home prices up 40% in desirable zip codes? 
 
But tell them it&amp;#39;s shortages, &amp;quot;covid lifestyle driven&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;supply chain&amp;quot; problems (obviously the supply chain was affected, but it&amp;#39;s demand driven from the 4,000 million / day we printed for 2 years straight (nearly 800 days)), and the proles are totally unaware / distracted.

It&amp;#39;s basically a tell-tale for everyone who&amp;#39;s had it.  Guy in the movie theater next to me last weekend...  Same cough...  Same reason...  Neighbor down the street....same cough...same reason...  Cashier at Krogers...same cough....SAME REASON. 

Why does this matter?  

Frankly, the fact that it&amp;#39;s such a mild disease wouldn&amp;#39;t mean a thing -- for most people...

But Biden isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;most people.&amp;quot;  He&amp;#39;s the President of the United States... and WE -- THE PEOPLE -- have a right to know when he&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;infected&amp;#39; with something HE claims to be so &amp;quot;deadly.&amp;quot;

I&amp;#39;m not saying the market&amp;#39;s going to fall off a cliff - I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised to see a Q1 rally in 2022 in the larger market, but I&amp;#39;d be playing it safe betting on the large indices like SPY $QQQ $DIA etc. Beat up names like those shared earlier and small caps have a much better chance at nice upside moves in 2022 imo </td>

Another important note is that if bulls can manage to recover above 176.40 and hold above that area due to a renewed interest in this liquid zone then we may potentially see price action continue upward onto the next critical resistance at around 180.00. $SQQQ $QQQ $NQ_F </td>

On a unrelated note, Buying a used car by myself for the first time and damn if I didn’t get scammed…😂 

I feel like it’s a life lesson you need to learn the hard way…my mistake for trusting their explanation and signing some of the paperwork without reading it fully. 

I bought a car at night and the next day realized it was destroyed inside and out and didn’t run properly due to needing a new fuel pump…which won’t come until mid January. I’m trying to get the deal ripped up and the only way to get through to them is by spoofing my number when I haven’t been rude at all, even though they stranded me for Christmas Eve. 

Lesson learned, I thought the scumminess was just something from tv shows and movies…but it’s real. 😂 </td>

There is a direct correlation to those traders who long VIX-ETPs and poor disciplines.  
 
Examples:  
 
-These folks, almost guaranteed to participate in penny stocks (sub $5) 
-These folks tend to be bearish markets, perma to one degree or another. 
-These folks hyper-focused on day-to-day P&amp;amp;L change.

This stock has been outperforming the market and will likely do so in the future, given no major market event to halt the rally. I&amp;#39;m rating this stock a 6/10 based on its current situation⭐ 

The Positive Sentiment Price level is between $142.56-$171.07. 

For me, a short/long term Sell target for active traders from the current price would be between $198.14-$199.58. 

One year ago from today, $AAPL was trading at $131.97 so at the current price, $AAPL is up 36.49%!

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $AAPL learning to read a chart will enhance your profits. IMO, I look for two consecutive green candles to cross above the 5 day moving average (green line) to decide when to enter a trade. It happened on 10/8. Normally I would wait another day because the 50 day moving average (red) is so close, but it&amp;#39;s APPLE, so I bought in at 145.00. 
Long term I don&amp;#39;t believe you can lose in AAPLE, but short term, I am looking for a sell signal, which starts with two consecutive red candles under the 5 day moving average, which hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet, except on 11/11 but that time it also was hindered by the 50 day moving average (red) so I had to wait one more day.
The moving averages are not the only thing that works, but it is a guide.
As you can see, I am up nearly 35.00/share and haven&amp;#39;t had a reason to look at an exit.
Have a terrific Wednesday. </td>

Alot of chatter about sell off after ATH or 3T MC

I suggest this is silly ..

Why?

We already have highest MC and you still haven’t sell off yet plus you haven’t sell off since AAPL already broke ATH before.

This is such a nonsense ..

You may sell off if AAPL failed expectation or someone important resign or SEC wants to break up this company.

But NONE of these any above criteria have been met or triggered it.

Even analysts sees 200 PT and I also see 210 PT </td>

My thoughts on the week ahead in the stk mkt  ... 

This weekend I am going to be posting a special Game Plan for the Year. In it I will be focusing on my top picks, both long and short for the first half of 2022. 

For those who are interested in receiving as well as joining, feel free to email me at

jessielivermore1929@gmail.com 

It has been an amazing 8 months since I began my blog site with daily tips and alerts, technical analysis and morning and evening mkt commentary. And I have thoroughly enjoyed providing an educational platform for both traders and investors. 

I have been fortunate to have gotten ahead of some big mkt moves, both long and short for those who subscribe to my service. And there have been some enormous moves in stocks listed each week in my Game Plans I put out each week on Sunday.  Which stocks will be the next AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, MARA in 2022? Or will we see a climax followed by a big selloff? 
I will give my view this Sunday.✌️ </td>

I just found this on Reddit.  Any thoughts?  

EMERGENCY SPREAD THE WORD!!  $CKPT (CURRENTLY AT $3.00) IS ABOUT TO BE A 5-BAGGER AS EARLY AS TOMORROW MORNING!!  HERE IS WHY!   Merck generates 15b a year from their cancer drug Keytruda, which is the highest revenue-generating drug on the planet. Keytruda is the #1 cancer drug in the world and it accounts for 36% of Merck’s revenue. CKPT stock at $3.00 is releasing their top-line results within the next 72 hours (and most likely tomorrow morning) for their new drug Cosibelimab, which is set to be the “Best in Class” drug and superior to Keytruda and any drugs in that class, and CKPT is only at $3.00.  Could go to $100 THIS WEEK!   So buckle up! </td>

We had winter storm Last year too), no great resignation saga. No SUPPLY chain issues. Buy calls. Join the pumpers. If you burn, blame on
Manipulation but just buy calls.

- Amazon owns 20% of Rivian
- Amazon generated revenues of over $122 Billion in 2021

$LCID LUCID IS BACKED BY:
- Saudi PIF who owns 63% of Lucid
- The Saudi PIF manages $430 Billion in Assets

$TSLA TESLA IS BACKED BY:
- Elon Musk (Richest Person in the World)
- Elon Musk is the Genius behind Tesla and SpaceX

FYI: RIVIAN AND LUCID HAS A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE TO GROW AND THAT IS WHAT SEPARATES THEM FROM TESLA. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA Tsla has now been re-rated as a trillion dollar company. Re-rating is based on what people/institutions are willing to pay during a stock offering. Tesla did not do an offering, however Elon had offered up 15.7m shares which was all absorbed by the market at mostly over 1T marketcap. This now signals a new level of support going forward.  If there were any fear of Tsla being in a bubble, this stock sale should provide enough proof to the strength of Tesla&amp;#39;s share price as the people have spoken.

Despite a global chip shortage, we believe Tesla is set to deliver a record number of vehicles this quarter and will beat street estimates of around 265,000. Despite the chip shortage, Tesla has shown strong adaptability by being able to make their own parts, and adjust their processes as necessary. Tesla has superior manufacturing and engineering on their side as well. Tesla has also expanded Giga Shanghai and Fremont, despite not delivering any cars from Giga Berlin or Giga Texas yet.

We believe Tesla will deliver 280,000 vehicles for Q4, 2021. This is due to strong China total deliveries expected (over 55K for November, 2021 alone) from Giga Shanghai, as well as a continued increase in demand globally. So far, Tesla is proving to be the only EV manufacturer that is scaling big. And yes, this number isn&amp;#39;t even factoring Giga Berlin or Giga Austin, TX, yet!

 “Looking into 2022, we expect Tesla to continue to post strong revenue growth, to report lower operating expenses, and to improve automotive gross margins, setting the stage for significant profit acceleration. Additionally, Tesla’s recent announcement to open its Supercharger Network to other non-Tesla vehicles is a brilliant strategy, in our opinion, as Tesla not only has the largest fast-charging network in the world, which would benefit any EV owner, but it would also generate a new and potentially immense revenue stream in the years ahead by charging non-Tesla EV owners a fee for the use of a fast-charging Tesla Supercharger,” Selesky said in a client note.

“Musk &amp;amp; Co. have navigated the chip supply shortages better than any automaker globally over the last six months, which is why Tesla is in a clear position of strength heading into 2022 with an inflection point year ahead. We see three main catalysts for Tesla in 2022 that if successful will be a major driver of the stock moving higher,” Ives said in a client note.

China, in particular, is seen as a “key variable” on the road to unlocking the Tesla bull case. Ives argues that the China story is worth $400.00 per share to Tesla for 2022, hence the bull case price target of $1,800.00.

China is seen as a key as it is expected to represent 40% of all Tesla deliveries in 2022. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA what peopel don’t understand is that Tesla will run just for the sake of running and when it does it creates gamma squeezes and short squeezes so even if he “tweeted” last week the fact that everyone in the market has been waiting for the form 4 to file to specifically state he is done is what will be the catalyst to pump this. PMs will want to get in before numbers deliveries and want their portfolios set for next year. It’s a self fulfilling prophecy. That’s what Tesla is. </td>

Mania is a wonderful thing. Rampant call buying will cause call sellers to buy high volume of shares. Whether that nets a serious rise this particular 3 trading days is not certain. GL </td>
