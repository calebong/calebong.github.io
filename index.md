   <td style="text-align:left;"> Japanese Shares Rebound as Omicron Risks Mulled </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Nikkei 225 Index jumped 1.7% towards 28,230 and the broader Topix Index gained 1.3% to 1,965 on Tuesday, as the global sell off in risk assets abated in Asia, while investors continued to monitor the situation around the omicron variant. Today’s action came after a two-day rout in Japanese equities, driven mainly by the fast-spreading omicron variant and the Bank of Japan’s taper announcement last week. Meanwhile, BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that it was too early to consider normalizing monetary policy, bolstering the view that the Japanese central bank would lag behind other central banks in scaling back monetary stimulus. All sectors of the market participated in the rebound, with notable gains from Lasertec (3.4%), Nintendo (3.7%), Tokyo Electron (3.4%), Toyota (1.5%), Shionogi (7%), Nippon Yusen (1.5%), Science Arts (10%) and Fast Retailing (1.7%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australian Shares Gain on Financials Boost </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2% to around 7,310 on Tuesday, helped mainly by gains in financial stocks, while investors stayed cautious amid surging omicron cases which triggered virus curbs in Europe. Domestically, Australian authorities urged a “move away from fear” and to “learn to live alongside” the virus on Monday, resisting calls for tighter restrictions as the country is pushing to ease curbs amid high vaccination rates. Sentiment was also lifted after the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s December meeting minutes, which showed that it is adamant not to lift rates until it sees stronger wage growth. The “Big Four” banks and other financial firms traded higher, led by a 5% rebound in Magellan shares which slumped in the previous session after losing a major client. Energy stocks also rebounded, tracking wild swings in oil prices. Elsewhere, mining companies and technology firms were mixed in early trade. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> RBA Sees Strong Recovery in 2022 Despite Omicron Threat </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Australian economy was rapidly recovering after the interruption to growth caused by the outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) December meeting minutes showed. "High rates of vaccination and substantial policy support continued to underpin the recovery," it noted,  adding that the emergence of the Omicron variant was a new source of uncertainty but it was not expected to derail the recovery. The board reiterated that it remained committed to holding interest rates steady at a record low of 0.1% while considering how and when to taper its A$4 billion bond-buying. The decision would depend on how the economy fared, with data on jobs, inflation, and spending particularly important. "The first option was to reduce the pace of purchases from mid-February with an expectation of a likely end point in May. The second option was to reduce the pace of purchases and review it again in May. The third option was to cease purchases altogether." </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fossil of a giant millipede reveals 'the biggest bug that ever lived' - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)A fossil of a giant millipede found on a beach in northern England has revealed the "biggest bug that ever lived," paleontologists say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The fossil was discovered in January 2018 in a chunk of sandstone that had fallen from a cliff onto the beach at Howick Bay in Northumberland. The rock had cracked open, revealing the fossil.                                                                                                                                                                         , "It was a complete fluke of a discovery," said Neil Davies, a lecturer in sedimentary geology at the University of Cambridge's department of earth sciences, who said the fossil was spotted by a former doctoral student.                                                                                                                                              , "It was an incredibly exciting find, but the fossil is so large it took four of us to carry it up the cliff face," said Davies in a news statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The fossilized remains of the creature, named Arthropleura, dated from the Carboniferous Period about 326 million years ago. That's over 100 million years before the rise of the dinosaurs.                                                                                                                                                                            , When alive, the creature was estimated to have been 55 centimeters (22 inches) wide and up to 2.63 meters (8.6 feet) in length, weighing 50 kilograms (110 pounds). That would make it the largest-known invertebrate of all time -- larger than ancient sea scorpions that previously held this title, the statement said. Invertebrates are animals with no backbone. , "This is definitely the biggest bug that ever lived," Davies confirmed via email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , It's only the third Arthropleura fossil to have been discovered. The other two were found in Germany and were much smaller than the new specimen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , To get to such a size, they must have eaten a nutritious diet. At that time, Britain lay on the equator, and invertebrates and early amphibians likely lived off the vegetation growing in a series of creeks and rivers.                                                                                                                                               , The researchers think the fossilized skeleton was likely a moulted segment of exoskeleton that filled with sand, preserving it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "Finding these giant millipede fossils is rare, because once they died, their bodies tend to disarticulate (separate at the joints), so it's likely that the fossil is a moulted carapace that the animal shed as it grew," said Davies in the statement.                                                                                                               , "We have not yet found a fossilized head, so it's difficult to know everything about them," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Arthropleura animals crawled around for about 45 million years before going extinct. It's not known exactly why they disappeared, but it could be due to a changing climate that didn't suit them. Or it could have occurred during the emergence of reptiles, which came to dominate the same type of habitat.                                                         , The fossil will go on public display at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge, England in 2022. The research was published in the Journal of the Geological Society.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Futures Rise After Omicron-Triggered Rout </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures climbed on Tuesday after selling broadly in the previous session amid fresh concerns around the rapidly-spreading omicron variant. Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 futures each rose 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.6%. Tuesday’s action came after three straight down days for the major averages, driven mainly by fears about the new variant and a hawkish policy turn from the Federal Reserve. Also weighing on sentiment is democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to the Biden administration’s $2 trillion Build Back Better Act, which is set to be voted on by the US Senate in January. All sectors of the market finished lower, led by losses in consumer cyclical, financial, industrials and basic materials stocks. Some notable decliners include Tesla (-3.5%), Rivian Automotive (-7.9%), JPMorgan (-1.8%), UPS (-2.01%) and The Sherwin-Williams (-1.4%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Democrats scramble to avoid electoral blowback after Manchin halts Biden agenda  - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)It's exactly the scenario Democrats had worked for months to avoid -- but now find themselves confronting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Vulnerable members were forced to cast a tough vote in an already daunting election year. And now, they are left with nothing to show for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , With Sen. Joe Manchin effectively wielding a veto over President Joe Biden's agenda, House Democrats are now fuming at the prospects that their vote last month to pass the Build Back Better bill will be all for naught, having made scores of promises to voters only to have them all go unfulfilled.                                                                                                                                     , And Democrats in difficult races are calling on Manchin to return to the negotiating table and for their party's leaders to recalibrate their strategy to find some way to pass individual pieces of the $1.75 trillion proposal, even though doing that would require sign off from Manchin and would force them to replay the party infighting that has dogged Biden in his first year in office.                                           , "I'm obviously upset -- pissed off about what happened," said Rep. Tom Malinowski, a Democrat who represents a New Jersey swing district. "We certainly are not going to win an election spending the next year bemoaning the fact that Joe Manchin didn't do Build Back Better in December. We win by sprinting out of the starting gate in January."                                                                                        , "I think it's imperative that Democrats pass a measure to support children and families and the economic wellbeing of the American middle class and to take steps to address climate change," said Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat.

They spoke by phone Sunday night and discussed reengaging on the matter in the new year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Yet getting a scaled-back plan through Congress is hardly a guarantee -- especially with the trust deficit at rock bottom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "He simply can't be trusted to be a man of his word," Rep.

In a phone call Monday, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said she conveyed her frustration directly to the senator -- and she's now calling on Biden to act administratively instead.                                                                                                            , But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says he will still put the $1.75 trillion bill on the floor in January, forcing Manchin to officially vote no to block the measure. It will take weeks to even get to that point to hold the first procedural vote, which is bound to fail.                                                                                                                                                          , And Manchin is showing little interest in pushing through a narrower bill, arguing that Democrats should instead take their time and go through the committee process, something that could take months and ultimately would require the backing of 10 Republicans if they opt to go through the normal legislative order, as the moderate Democrat has been demanding.                                                                       , All of which means Democrats could be faced with many more weeks of legislative squabbling and no bill to show for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "After months of negotiations, one Democratic US senator has now summarily walked away from productive negotiations," said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat facing a difficult race. "That is unacceptable."                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Democrats believe there's still time to reverse voter sentiment. And they plan to campaign heavily on approval of the sweeping $1.2 trillion infrastructure law -- and the nearly $2 trillion in Covid relief package enacted in the spring -- despite the failure to approve the Build Back Better measure.                                                                                                                                  , "Voters make up their minds starting next summer," Malinowski said, calling on Congress to also approve a bill aimed improving US competitiveness with China. "Infrastructure is a huge deal in New Jersey. There's going to be so much money coming into my district from the infrastructure bill and what has already come via Covid relief."                                                                                               , Of the larger package, the congressman added: "We haven't not gotten it done yet."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Déjà vu from 2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Yet the situation Democrats are in now is emblematic of the scenario that Speaker Nancy Pelosi found herself in 12 years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Bolstered by a huge majority in 2009, Pelosi pushed through a major bill aimed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions -- something that was furiously opposed by the fossil-fuel industry, Republicans and moderate Democrats -- and was narrowly approved despite 44 Democrats who voted against it. The bill was later ignored by the Senate, drawing the ire of House Democrats who had to cast a tough vote on a bill that went nowhere. ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , They lost the House in 2010, in an election where Democrats encountered backlash for their push to expand social programs and enact the Affordable Care Act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , This year, Pelosi tried to avoid a similar scenario -- and she had promised for weeks that House Democrats would only approve a bill that had been agreed to by all 50 Democratic senators. With an agreement elusive after months of talks, the California Democrat reversed course and scheduled a vote on the House Democrats' version of the bill last month. Only one Democrat, Jared Golden of Maine, voted against it.                 , Asked if the biggest hurdles were in "the rearview mirror" during a press conference last month, following the House's passage of the bill, Pelosi told reporters: "Yes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , She later added: "It's really cause for celebration for us now.  And we're not getting bogged down in long speeches or (are) people's careers over, what happens if this doesn't happen. What we're talking about is what has happened."                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Yet if the bill doesn't become law, Democrats will have to confront the promises they made to their voters that didn't pan out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , For Democrats in high-tax cities and states, primarily in the Northeast and on the West Coast, they had promised to relieve their constituents from getting hit with huge levies because of the limits Republicans placed on state and local tax deductions in their 2017 tax law. But with the collapse of Build Back Better, getting a deal to pass a SALT plan seems grim at best.                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "Having passed SALT relief through the House floor four times, I remain as committed as ever to finding a path through the Senate for this and other New Jersey priorities," said Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from New Jersey who faces a potentially tough road to reelection.                                                                                                                                                           , Democrats already face bleak prospects of holding onto their razor-thin House majority, especially as retirements continue to climb -- with 22 Democrats already publicly announcing they plan to step aside, compared to 11 Republicans. Plus with the challenges of redistricting, Biden's sagging poll numbers and the difficulties a President's party typically faces in his first midterm, the environment facing Democrats is dire.    , In the Senate, where the battle for the majority could go either way, vulnerable Democrats had been hoping to campaign on the bill's passage as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "I'm more about getting it done right than getting it done on some schedule," Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat facing reelection next year, said when asked last week about the slipping timetable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But Kelly also acknowledged the problems facing families in his state if the child tax credit expires at year's end.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 'Santa rally' won't rekindle due to omicron risks and profit-taking, PNC Financial's CIO predicts </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , PNC Financial is throwing cold water on the fourth-quarter rally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Covid omicron fears will take a heavy toll on risk appetites over the next two weeks, according to Chief Investment Officer Amanda Agati.                                                                                                                                                                                                , "We've already gotten the Santa rally," she told CNBC's "Trading Nation" on Monday. "We're seeing a little bit of investor fatigue here."                                                                                                                                                                                                , The major indexes kicked off the week in the red. The S&amp;P 500 is down 3% over the past three days. It's the index's worst three-day slide since September.                                                                                                                                                                               , Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down almost 4% in the same time span.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "In addition to the omicron fears and negative headlines swirling around, I think investors are kind of locking in some of those gains and ready to go on Christmas vacation," she said.                                                                                                                                                 , Yet, she doesn't see a deeper problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "We don't think this is going to lead to a significant market correction," said Agati, who noted liquidity is fairly low this time of year.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Agati's optimism hinges on omicron having fewer severe repercussions than previous Covid-19 strains. Her longer-term 2022 forecast, which came out Monday, is built on the assumption omicron won't lead to hospitalization spikes, economic shutdowns and more supply chain trouble.                                                    , Even though her top wildcard is Covid, her base case is that 2022 will be a strong year for the market. Plus, she believes one of this year's biggest losers will stage a major rebound.                                                                                                                                                 , "EM [emerging markets] is very well positioned, but it's been absolutely punished from the regulatory overhangs. What I think will be interesting in 2022 is we'll start to see some of that... China regulatory backdrop fade," Agati said. "That would really be the shot in the arm that emerging markets need to outperform in 2022.", Disclaimer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Stock futures climbed in overnight trading Monday following a broad sell-off amid fears about the fast-spreading Covid omicron variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 140 points, S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.6%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Nike shares jumped about 3% in extended trading after the sneaker maker reported quarterly earnings and sales that exceeded analysts' expectations, despite ongoing supply chain pressures.                                                                                                                                                                                 , The overnight action came after a losing day on Wall Street with low trading volume ahead of the holidays. The blue-chip Dow dropped more than 400 points for its third straight declining session. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both declined more than 1% Monday, and the S&amp;P's three-day drop of 3% was its worst such showing since September.                  , The omicron surge has kept investors on edge with the variant now found in at least 43 U.S. states and 90 countries. Officials with the World Health Organization said omicron is more contagious than any previous variant of Covid-19. It accounted for 73% of new infections in the U.S. last week, federal health officials said Monday.                                , Monday's stock sell-off erased the S&amp;P 500's earlier gains in December, to flatline for the month; Dow is up about 1.3%, while the Nasdaq is down nearly 3.6% and is on pace to snap a two-month winning streak.                                                                                                                                                            , "As we head into the shortened holiday week amid surging omicron cases, continued supply chain pressures and the failure of the Build Back Better plan, increased volatility and thinner trading volumes could cause the market to overreact, which could be a buying opportunity in the run-up to Christmas," said Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research., Investors also assessed the prospect for President Joe Biden's economic agenda. The Senate will vote on Biden's sweeping social safety net and climate policy bill in January, despite Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's opposition to it. It is unclear if Democrats will try to pass a smaller bill that includes only parts of the full package.                             , Got a confidential news tip?

The true cost is $5 trillion. Not $1.75 Trillion. It is not paid for. The spending will promote more inflation. The electric grid and all our energy infrastructure will be severely damaged, sinking the economy and jacking up costs. In his statement, he added concerns about national security. Whether the U.S. would have sufficient resources to deal with Russia and China if need be. He is always insisted on work requirements for social spending. He has always opposed a middle-class entitlement state., And more generally, Sen. Manchin has consistently rejected the Biden transformation policy regarding canceling traditional cultural values, ending traditional American history, using over-regulation to control the economy, rejecting free enterprise capitalism or taxing our businesses and middle-income blue-collar families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , MANCHIN KILLING BBB LIKEY SAVED US FROM ECONOMIC ‘DISASTER,’ EXPERTS SAY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , FreedomWorks economist Stephen Moore argues Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's rejection of Biden's 'Build Back Better' plan is 'an early Christmas present for America' given the bill would have led to massive increases in debt and higher taxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , I continue to believe the Biden policy agenda is dead. It was all wound up in this monstrosity bill, and that's over. There may be some new bill next year, but it's going to have to be a lot different to get any traction. This bill is killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Now the question is: Can Biden preserve his presidency? Which looks to be failing. On inflation, on Afghanistan, on illegal immigration, on COVID, and on public support where his polls continue a record plunge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Joe Manchin is trying to help the Democratic Party, but Joe Biden and his radical left-wing progressives are killing the Democratic Party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , TRUMP WARNS INFLATION ‘SNOWBALLING WORSE THAN EVER’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A new 'BBB' bill won't help. A White House in denial of their failures will not help. I can only think back 25 years ago to the Bill Clinton years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Clinton got whooped badly in '94 leading to a Republican takeover of the Senate and the House after the defeat of 'Hillary Care' to nationalize the health sector and big tax hike on small business. What did Clinton do? He gave a State of the Union speech in January of '95 where he made a conservative pivot back to the center and declared that the era of big government is over. And he preceded to work with Republicans, like Newt Gingrich for dramatic welfare reform with workfare, spending restraint, a capital gains tax cut.                                      , The economy rebounded and Clinton won in '96. Clinton was a smart politician.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Rep.

So is his vice president. So is his senior staff. And so are the congressional Dem leaders. Bill Clinton and Al Gore really were moderately conservative southern Democrats.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, slumped 2% to close at 105,019 on Monday, its lowest since December 2nd, tracking a negative sentiment in international markets due to mounting concerns over the economic impact of the fast-spreading Omicron Covid-19 variant. Locally, health authorities pointed out that despite lower cases and deaths, the possibility of a new Covid outbreak in Brazil exists due to the holiday season, the uncertainty around the Omicron strain, vaccination coverage, and public health measures. Investors also digested the massive setback to President Joe Biden's economic agenda, which prompted Goldman Sachs to cut US growth forecasts. Meanwhile, Brazil's central bank financial markets' weekly survey showed growth projections were cut again to 4.58% from 4.65% for 2021 and kept unchanged at 0.50% for 2022, while inflation forecasts were revised slightly lower to 10.04% from 10.05% for 2021, but raised marginally to 5.03% from 5.02% for 2022. </td>

It was the highest rate since October of 2008, driven by prices of manufactured products (16.0 percent vs 15.7 percent in October), electric power, gas, water &amp; waste (8.3 percent vs 6.2 percent), and agricultural, forestry &amp; marine products (5.8 percent vs 2.6 percent). Meantime, the prices of the services continued to increase by around 2.6 percent. On a monthly basis, producer prices went up 0.5 percent, the 13th consecutive monthly rise amid higher costs of energy-related products and agricultural products, which increased 1.8 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Backdoor Roth 401(k) and IRA rules for the wealthy survive — for now </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The "backdoor Roth" tax strategy used largely by wealthy retirement savers and slated to be killed next year has survived — for now.                                                                                                                                                                                , The loophole lets rich 401(k) and individual retirement account owners save in a Roth-style account, shielding future investment growth from tax. Roth accounts are generally off-limits to such investors due to an income cap.                                                                                    , Democrats aimed to end the rules starting in 2022 as part of the Build Back Better Act, a roughly $1.75 trillion package of climate and social investments coupled with changes to the tax code aimed at rich Americans.                                                                                            , More from Personal Finance:How to refresh your home office as return-to-work plans stallProposed Medicare changes in trouble as legislation stallsHow credit card debt imperils your retirement savings                                                                                                             , House Democrats passed the legislation in November; Senate Democrats hoped to pass it by year's end. But Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., scuttled those plans on Sunday, announcing that he won't back the measure in its current form. Manchin's vote is crucial to pass the bill due to unified Republican opposition., The delay means the prohibition on the backdoor Roth strategy won't kick in at the beginning of 2022 as planned — meaning taxpayers may not have to scramble to take advantage of the rules before they're outlawed.                                                                                                , If Democrats pass the legislation early next year, it's likely (though not certain) that Congress would postpone the effective date to 2023, experts said.                                                                                                                                                          , "I don't think you're going to have an effective date in the middle of the year," said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "That's too cumbersome."                                                                                                                         , "You might have thought you should be racing to get a backdoor Roth in place," Rosenthal said. "But you don't need to race."                                                                                                                                                                                        , The backdoor Roth rules were among the few targeting wealthy retirement savers that would have begun next year. Others, like one creating new distribution rules for retirement savings exceeding $10 million, would have started later in the decade.                                                              , The prohibition on backdoor Roth contributions would affect all taxpayers, unlike most other aspects of Democrats' tax proposals, which impact households with $400,000 or more of income.                                                                                                                          , Roth accounts are especially attractive to wealthy investors. Investment growth and future withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, and there aren't required withdrawals at age 72 as with traditional pre-tax accounts.                                                                                            , However, there are income limits to contribute to Roth IRAs. In 2021, single taxpayers can't save in one if their income exceeds $140,000. (The cap is $208,000 for married couples filing a joint tax return.)                                                                                                     , High-income individuals can skirt the income limits via a "backdoor" contribution. Investors who save in a traditional, pre-tax IRA can convert that money to Roth; they pay tax on the conversion, but shield earnings from future tax.                                                                            , (There isn't an income limit for contributions to pre-tax IRAs. However, wealthy taxpayers likely can't deduct that contribution from their taxes, as lower earners can.)                                                                                                                                           , Workplace retirement plans (like a 401(k) plan) don't prohibit wealthy investors from Roth savings. But another loophole — the "mega backdoor Roth" strategy — lets them invest large sums of money well above the typical annual contribution limits in 401(k)s and IRAs.                                          , This process involves making an after-tax contribution to a 401(k) and converting that savings to a Roth-style 401(k) or IRA account.                                                                                                                                                                               , IRA and 401(k) rules disallow more than $6,000 and $19,500 of annual contributions in 2021, respectively. (Those limits are higher — $7,000 and $26,000, respectively — for those age 50 and older.)                                                                                                                , However, some employers permit savers to invest tens of thousands of additional funds via after-tax contributions courtesy of other tax rules.                                                                                                                                                                      , In 2021, employees could save an additional $38,500 in a 401(k) plan via after-tax contributions, which may then be converted to Roth funds. (It's $45,000 for those age 50 and older.)                                                                                                                             , Most employers don't allow for such contributions, though. Roughly 20% of 401(k) plans did so in 2020, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America. The share is nearly double that when examining just the largest companies, with over 5,000 employees participating in the plan.                            , Got a confidential news tip?

       in a deal with an enterprise value of $3.1 billion.  The new company is trading under the ticker "ZGN." The Zegna family will continue to lead the company as it has done throughout its 111-year history. CEO Ermenegildo Zegna will retain his position as head of the company that owns the Zegna and Thom Browne brands. The company will have $761 million in proceeds from the SPAC deal, including a $250 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE.

To save money, she looks for less expensive cuts of meat and has switched to a cheaper detergent. She also clips coupons and shops for her kids’ clothing at thrift stores instead of Children’s Place.                                                                                                                                                                     , For the holidays, she's scaling back on gifts. She plans to spend $600 on her three young children instead of $1,000, and she won’t be buying any gifts for relatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "It’s stressful," said the 33-year-old stay-at-home mother from Boardman, Ohio, whose husband earns $30,000 a year making pallets for stores.

For some, they're a mere inconvenience, pushing them to delay building a deck on their house amid higher lumber prices. But for lower-income households with little or no cash cushions, they're making harder choices such as whether they can put food on the table or if they'll have to drastically scale back on holiday presents for their children – or forgo them completely. , "Inflation is devastating the pocketbooks of low-income households," said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of the America's Research Group, estimating that low-income households are cutting back their holiday buying by 20% from a year ago. "They are going to have to decide what they are going to buy and what they're going to eat."                                                                                                                         , Even some retailers that built their businesses around the allure of ultra-low prices have begun boosting them. Dollar Tree – the last true dollar store – is increasing its prices to $1.25 for a majority of its products because of higher costs of goods and freight. Velazquez says that 25 cents extra per item adds up, and the increase will force her to scale back on impulse buying there.                                                         , Despite the inflation pressures – as well as supply chain disruptions and the new COVID-19 omicron variant – the National Retail Federation says this year’s holiday shopping season appears to be on track to exceed its sales growth forecast of between 8.5% and 10.5%.                                                                                                                                                                                    , According to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, about three-quarters of Americans say they will be giving gifts to friends and family to celebrate the winter holidays this year. But the rising costs have not gone unnoticed. About 6 in 10 Americans say holiday gift prices are higher than usual, while only 2 in 10 say they are not. Roughly 2 in 10 say they did not purchase gifts recently.                    , Overall, 4 in 10 Americans say it has been harder to afford the things they want to give as gifts this year. Roughly half say it’s neither easier nor harder, while few say it has been easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But people in lower income groups are feeling the cost pressures most acutely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Forty-five percent of Americans in households earning less than $50,000 annually and 40% in households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 say it has been harder to afford gifts this year, compared with 30% in higher income households.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "It was hard enough a year ago, five years ago, for lower-income families to find extra money to buy gifts. But it is that much harder now," said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, whose survey in October found a significant number of low-income people were completely opting out of holiday gifting this year amid higher prices on essentials.                                                                                  , CLICK HERE TO GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Customers wait in line to check out during a Black Friday sale at Macy's, Nov. 26, 2021, in Indianapolis.

In the past three months, Shiloh has seen a spike in the number of people, particularly those with jobs, coming in to pick up a weekly box of essentials or shop at its market for free produce and other food, according to Jason Bautista, who runs the food pantry.                                                                          , That prompted Bautista to bring in more holiday toys for the annual giveaway set for this Saturday. It will have about 2,000 toys to donate to families this weekend compared with about 1,500 a year ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "Families that would normally go to Safeway can't afford to with their fixed incomes," Bautista said. "Their dollar is not stretching."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Miriam Canales, 34, of Oakland, has been going weekly to Shiloh for free food since the beginning of the pandemic. Her husband lost his job as a chef at a restaurant that permanently closed in the spring of 2020. He got another job at a different restaurant a few months ago, but he's only working on average six hours a week.                                                                                                                        , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , She said higher food prices have added financial stress, and she will not be buying gifts for her children, ages, 13 and 6. Instead, she plans to pick up toys on Saturday at Shiloh Church.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But Canales says she feels grateful this holiday season because of her husband's job as well as her daughter's recovery from brain radiation that landed her in the hospital with epilepsy a year ago. Now she's healthy again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "I feel blessed," Canales said.  </td>

Married couples can claim up to $2,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Taxpayers are eligible to take advantage of the credit so long as they are over the age of 18, are not a student and are not claimed as a dependent by anyone else. In order to claim it, individuals must contribute to either an IRA or an employer-sponsored retirement account. That encompasses any contribution made to a 401(k), 403(b), governmental 457(b), as well as any after-tax contribution made to a Thrift Savings Plan.                                     , BIDEN PITCHES REVAMPED MILLIONAIRES TAX, GLOBAL MINIMUM TO FUND SPENDING BILL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , There are also income thresholds limiting who is able to claim the tax credit.

However, the credit begins to taper for higher-earners. Individuals must earn less than $20,500 to claim 50% of their retirement contribution, while the maximum is $41,000 for married couples and $30,750 for heads of household.                                                                               , For instance, if a married couple earned $41,000 in 2021 and contributed $2,000 to their IRA for the year, they could deduct a 50% credit of $1,000 for the $2,000 contribution on their 2021 tax return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , A recent report published by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies suggests that just 43% of workers are aware of the saver's credit. Even more worrisome, just 35% of those with household income below $50,000 are aware of the tax credit, even though they are intended to be the biggest beneficiaries of it.                                                                                                                                                   , A man enters the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Friday, May 7, 2010.  (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , By comparison, more than half of households with income above $100,000 said they knew about the credit, according to the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Tax credits are subtracted from the taxes that you owe – not your taxable income – and give you a dollar-for-dollar reduction on your liability. For instance, if your federal tax bill was $10,000, and you're entitled to a $2,000 tax credit, your bill would be cut to $8,000.                                                                                                                                                                                            , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Experts largely agree that tax credits are better for reducing your bill than deductions. Most likely, if you ever had to choose between a $100 deduction and a $100 credit, you'd pick the credit, which would reduce your bill by $100, according to TurboTax. On the other hand, how much money you saved by reducing your taxable income by $100 would depend on your tax bracket. If you were in the 24% tax bracket in 2019, a $100 deduction reduces your taxes by $24., "Credits win every time because they are a dollar-for-dollar reduction of your tax bill," Megan Brinsfield, CPA and director of financial planning at Motley Fool Wealth Management, said. "Deductions will reduce your overall income before applying to your tax rate." </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The GfK Consumer Confidence indicator in the United Kingdom edged lower to -15 in December 2021 from -14 in the previous month, amid concerns over the Omicron variant. Both measures that look at how people see the coming year have slipped – personal finances over the next 12 months (1 vs 2 in November) and general economic situation during 2022 (-24 vs -23) – driven by concerns over the soaring cost of living with the prospect of looming interest rate rises piling on more pressure. In addition, consumers said they were less inclined to make major purchases during the countdown to Christmas (-6 vs -3). </td>

Carnival said advanced bookings for the second half of 2022 and 2023 are at high levels and at high prices relative to 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                         , Devon, Diamondback, Exxon Mobil — Energy stocks fell broadly on Monday as concerns about the omicron variant dragged down oil prices.

Cerner shares, which jumped nearly 13% on Friday following initial reports of the deal, inched less than 1% higher on Monday. The acquisition is the largest ever for Oracle.                                                      , Canopy Growth — Shares of the cannabis producer dropped 8.8% after Piper Sandler downgraded the stock to underweight from neutral, citing sales trends under pressure. Last week, Wells Fargo initiated coverage of the stock with an underweight rating, calling the company overvalued.                                                                                                                                                                   , Sunrun — Shares of the residential solar company dipped 8.2% amid uncertainty about the Build Back Better bill, and after KeyBanc cut the stock to a sector weight rating. The firm's call centers on the proposed decision from California regulators to slash solar incentives that have been instrumental to the industry's growth. Given Sunrun's exposure to the California market, KeyBanc said the valuation implications are "too wide for comfort.", AT&amp;T — Shares of the telecom giant rose 1.7% amid a broad market sell-off after an upgrade from Barclays. The Wall Street firm hiked its rating on AT&amp;T to overweight from neutral, saying the telecom stock deserved to close the valuation gap on some of its rivals.                                                                                                                                                                                     , Verso — Shares of Verso surged nearly 35% after the Ohio-based maker of specialty, graphic and packaging paper announced it will be acquired by Swedish paper producer BillerudKorsnas in a deal worth $27 per share in cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , — CNBC's Yun Li, Tanaya Macheel, Jesse Pound and Pippa Stevens contributed reporting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Got a confidential news tip?

The deal is valued at about $1 billion and is expected to close in the first half of 2022, at which point the combined company will be named Mondee and trade on Nasdaq under the ticker "MOND." The company was founded in 2011 by Prasad Gundumogula, who is its current CEO, and initially focused on the private airfare market. It has since expanded to hotel and cars, cruise and tour offerings.

The new company will have $241.5 million in cash from the SPX and another $50 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors including Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Origami and ARCPE; principals of major private equity funds; strategic investors in travel and leisure such as Travco and Entertainment Benefits Group (EBG); and a diverse group of prominent family offices from the U.S. and Europe.

In Australia, although states have pushed back against talks of tighter pandemic rules, consumers have been canceling holidays and restaurant reservations. New South Wales saw record daily infection numbers at the start of the week, but the local government of Australia’s most populous state moved forward with easing restrictions despite warnings from epidemiologists. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Brazilian real traded around 5.73 per USD, the lowest since October 22nd, as investors sentiment was dampened after Omicron jitters reignited amid a surge in cases and fresh lockdowns in Europe. The Netherlands led the way by imposing a nationwide lockdown on Sunday and the possibility of more Covid restrictions being introduced ahead of the holidays loomed over several European countries.  Also, investors’ perception that the Brazilian economic recovery has begun to succumb to rising inflation and higher interest rates is weighing in the currency appeal. Domestically, the IBC-Br, considered as a monthly preview of GDP, shrank by 0.4% MoM in October, below expectations of a 0.2% decrease, and marking the third consecutive negative reading. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index declined 5% to around 1,915 on Monday, extending an 8.5% loss in the previous session as a currency crisis and worsening macroeconomic backdrop led investors to a vast sell-off. The Istanbul stock exchange was forced to halt trading for the second consecutive session, as snowballed losses occurred from high levels of margin calls. Indications of low bank capital ratios combined with plunging lira made investors re-evaluate their positions in the wake of rampant inflation and currency crises. The lira crossed 18 USD to extend all-time lows, after the Central Bank of Turkey slashed its one-week repo auction rate by 100bps to 14% during its December meeting, following a 100bps cut in November, a 200bps cut in October, and a 100bps cut in September. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cotton futures extended losses to below 105 USd/Lbs, the lowest since October 13th on expectations of lower demand for garments due to the resurgence of new Omicron coronavirus variant, higher supply, and as higher prices are hurting demand for supplies from top shipper US. Further, demand is muted in top producer India as fabrics manufacturers were hesitant for new purchases due to the proposed hike in taxes from January 1. Meanwhile, the USDA in its December report estimated 2021/22 global production to drop by 200,000 bales as a 1.0 million bale drop in Pakistan more than offsets gains in Benin, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Cameroon. Also, world cotton ending stocks were projected 1.2 million bales lower due to lower beginning stocks, smaller production and slightly higher consumption. </td>

The energy stocks shed 3.2%, healthcare stocks were weighed down by a 3% drop in pot stocks, and materials lost almost 1% amid weaker bullion prices.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Nuclear Energy Index at 11-Week Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Nuclear Energy Index declined to around 1360, the lowest in 11 weeks, tracking lower oil and uranium prices, amid the shutdown of selected power stations. Pandemic related restriction measures from rising Covid-19 cases globally led traders to decrease the outlook on energy demand. At the same time, EDF shut down four of its reactors with a daily capacity of 6 gigawatts after detecting cracks on the pipes of a reactor on December 16th. As a result, the French nuclear giant’s shares plunged 17.4% since the shutdown and cut its profit guidance for 2021 by 3.5%, as it could spend EUR 2-3 billion to buy back the power to cover the reactor shortages. The event dented France’s push for bigger usage of nuclear energy, as the country leads the charge for the EU to include nuclear energy in its sustainable investment fund. Germany, on the other hand, opposes France’s nuclear drive, and already stated its remaining power plants will go offline next year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian dollar traded around 1.293, the lowest level since the beginning of December 2020 as a surge in Omicron cases weighed on risk appetite and a more hawkish policy stance from major central banks contrasted with the BoC's last statement. COVID-19 cases are rapidly growing in Canada, with Omicron replacing Delta as the dominant variant and several provinces trying to reintroduce restrictions. Meanwhile, several European countries have already tightened restrictions ahead of the holidays with the Netherlands imposing a nationwide lockdown. On the monetary policy front, during the last policy meeting, the Bank of Canada dashed investors' expectations for a shift to a more hawkish policy stance as the new variant Omicron had raised uncertainty around the economic recovery. At the same time, the Fed signaled three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022 and both the BoE and the Norges Bank already hiked their main rates. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Stocks Fall on Omicron Concerns </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wall Street tumbled on Monday as investors dumped travel stocks, big tech, and other growth shares, amid concerns about the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and its impact on the global economic recovery. Several countries in Europe announced movement restrictions while the US has reported more than 156K cases on Friday. In addition, putting additional pressure on markets US Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support President Biden's $1.9 trillion Build Back Better Act, which would see the expansion of the US social safety net and the reduction of Americans' childcare and health care costs, among others. Also, Fed Governor Waller said on Friday that the rate hike in March would be "very likely", following the Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday to end its pandemic-era stimulus faster. The Dow lost more than 600 points or 1.8% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 slumped 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.6% the lowest level since mid-October. </td>

Democrats had previously hailed the expanded child tax credit as a successful way to reduce poverty with direct payments to low-income families and were hoping to rely on that messaging ("Money in people's pockets and shots in people's arms") further ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. , New levies that have been pushed to the wayside indefinitely include a 15% minimum on corporations based on profits they report to shareholders, a tax that would only apply to companies that reported over $1 billion in income for three straight years. Senate Democrats estimated the tax would apply to about 200 companies. The "Build Back Better" framework also included a 15% global minimum tax, which would apply to companies' overseas earnings.                                                                                                     , Another tax shelved for now is a proposed 1% surcharge on stock buybacks that was designed to deter companies from repurchasing their own stock from investors and spur businesses to put that money toward long-term investments, such as hiring and wage increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Stock buybacks have become a frequent bipartisan target on Capitol Hill in recent years, as corporations use capital to reduce the number of outstanding shares by reabsorbing them, thereby increasing the earnings per share of the company, rather than growing the company or funneling it back to employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Then-presidential candidate Joe Biden speaks about on the third plank of his Build Back Better economic recovery plan for working families, on July 21, 2020, in New Castle, Delaware.  (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Biden had also called for a surtax on multimillionaires and billionaires, pitching a 5% rate on individuals with income above $10 million. That rate would climb to 8% for individuals with income above $25 million – in addition to the current top individual income tax rate of 37%. The White House estimated it would affect about 0.02% of taxpayers.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Other provisions in the bill that targeted wealthy taxpayers included an effort to close a loophole that allowed some rich Americans to avoid paying the 3.8% Medicare surtax on their earnings by strengthening a net investment income tax for anyone earning more than $400,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Manchin's objection also jettisoned Democrats' push to beef up tax enforcement by providing the IRS with $80 billion in additional funding to crack down on tax evaders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Democrats responded to Manchin's stunning withdrawal from negotiations with contempt and pledges to continue pushing for the bill's passage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Sen.

It was the first rate cut in 20 months, in a bid to boost growth as the economy faces increasing headwinds from the evolution of the pandemic, rising inflation rates, and a fragile property market. Unlike major central banks last week, which announced further tightening of monetary policies, the PBOC is expected to follow an even more accommodative stance in 2022. </td>

The International Energy Agency previously warned that a surge in Covid cases would dent global oil demand at a time when supply is set to increase, especially in the US.

Electric vehicle deliveries in China are expected to total 3 million units this year, more than double of last year’s, and forecasts point to more than 5 million sales in 2022. Meanwhile, bets on long-term scarcity of the light metal set EV manufacturers to race each other for long-term contracts, as lithium miners compete for contracts and face continued opposition from environmental groups. Mining giant Rio Tinto PLC pledged over USD 2 billion to develop lithium mines in Serbia, but backlash from protesters led local authorities to momentarily suspend the land-use plan for the mine. Elsewhere, leftist Gabriel Boric won presidential run-offs in Chile. During campaigns, the president-elect expressed plans on forming a state-owned lithium miner to manage the country’s “lithium triangle”, the world's largest reserve. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Aluminum futures remained close to $2,700 per tonne in the third week of December, after reaching a 7-week high at $2,724 in the previous week on worries over tight supplies. China's output of alumina, which is smelted to make aluminum, fell in November by 4.5% year-on-year to its lowest in 18 months as regions impose curbs on the aluminum raw material. Still, the price of aluminum is more than 10% below its 13-year high of $3,172 reached in mid-October, as supply disruptions connected to higher energy prices eased and aluminum ingot inventories have been falling at a slower pace as cargoes were piling up at railway stations in Xinjiang and the major Chinese manufacturing province of Zhejiang is fighting a Covid-19 outbreak. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK natural gas prices rebounded to 357 pence a therm on Monday, close to a record 359 pence hit last week and tracking gains in the Dutch contract, as a drop in flows through the key Yamal-Europe pipeline triggered supply woes. German network operator Gascade measured an hourly volume of 366,735 kWh, compared with more than 1.2 million kWh/h on Saturday and more than 10 million kWh/h on Friday. Prices have rallied to record highs underpinned by cold weather, delays in the highly anticipated approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, supply-cut threats from Belarus’ President, and jitters about harsh economic sanctions being slapped on Russia’s energy sector amid growing tensions in eastern Ukraine. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Bank of Uganda kept its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 6.5% during its December 2021 meeting, saying that the economy continued to require considerable monetary policy support, despite signs that economic activity is gradually normalizing. Policymakers noted that risks to the growth remain tilted to the downside, owing to persistent global supply chains disruptions and the Omicron variant. The annual inflation hit an eight-month high of 2.6% in November, amid rising prices of food crop prices and energy; and will likely continue to rise as the economy recovers further and spare capacity is absorbed. Still, it should stabilize around the 5% target, contingent on the evolution of the pandemic and the efficacy of vaccines. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> EU natural gas prices resumed their rally to new all-time highs near €147 per megawatt-hour in the third week of December, as a cold blast is set to hit several European capitals amid reports that flows through the key Yamal-Europe pipeline have fallen sharply over the weekend. German network operator Gascade measured an hourly volume of 366,735 kWh, compared with more than 1.2 million kWh/h on Saturday and more than 10 million kWh/h on Friday. Combined with low wind power generation and outages in French nuclear plants, delays in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and geopolitical risks in Belarus and Ukraine, Europe is facing one of the most severe supply squeezes on records. With imports running low and depleting inventories, investors are now fearing that the ongoing natural gas crunch could be extended into next winter. </td>

Although still above the long-term average, it has fallen to a level comparable to the prepandemic situation. Consumers have once again voiced more pessimistic forecasts for the general economic situation, so they have fallen back to a level not seen for a year. In addition, fears of a rise in unemployment over the next twelve months have clearly risen. On a personal front, households are expecting to be able to save less, while anticipating an improvement in their financial situation. </td>

On Sunday, the Netherlands imposed a nationwide lockdown and several European countries are weighing the possibility of more Covid restrictions being introduced ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays. Meanwhile, ECB policymaker Robert Holzmann said that the central bank was ready to adjust policy if inflation didn't fall as expected. Last week, the ECB  announced a reduction in the pace of its asset purchases over the coming quarter, citing the progress on economic recovery and towards its medium-term inflation target but pledged further stimulus avoiding any discussion about the possibility of future rate hikes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ghislaine Maxwell trial: Closing arguments focus on her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN)Jurors deliberated for less than an hour Monday at Ghislaine Maxwell's federal trial after the prosecution and defense presented closing arguments that focused on her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , As the prosecutors argued, Maxwell manipulated and enticed vulnerable girls as a key accomplice in Epstein's extensive scheme to sexually abuse underage girls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "Maxwell and Epstein were a wealthy couple who used their privilege to prey on kids from struggling families," prosecutor Alison Moe said. "The way that they selected these girls tells you that they were targeting vulnerable kids. It is not an accident that Jane and Kate and Annie and Carolyn all came from single-mother households."                                                                                                                                                                , In response, Maxwell's defense used its closing argument to attack the motivations of the women who testified about the abuse and to contend that Maxwell's association with Epstein is not criminal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "She's being tried here for being with Jeffrey Epstein, and maybe that was the biggest mistake of her life, but it was not a crime," attorney Laura Menninger told the jury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to six federal counts, including sex trafficking of minors, enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and three related counts of conspiracy. If convicted on all six counts, she faces up to 70 years in prison.                                                                                                                                                              , The jury deliberated for less than an hour Monday before adjourning for the day. They are expected to return Tuesday morning at 9 a.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The closing arguments come after a three-week trial highlighted by testimony from four women who alleged Epstein sexually abused them and that Maxwell facilitated and sometimes participated in that abuse. The abuse occurred when they were younger than 18 and their accusations stretched from 1994 to 2004.                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Jane" testified that Maxwell organized sexual massages with Epstein and sometimes joined in the abuse. "Kate" testified Maxwell set up those sexual meetings. Carolyn testified Maxwell touched her breasts, hips and butt and told her -- when she was 14 -- she "had a great body for Epstein and his friends." Finally, Annie Farmer testified she was 16 when Maxwell massaged her naked chest at Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996.                                                                    , The defense rested Friday after presenting its case over two days. They argued that Maxwell is being scapegoated for Epstein's criminal behavior and tried to attack the women's memories and motivations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Maxwell declined to testify Friday, telling Judge Alison Nathan when asked whether she understood her rights: "Your honor, the government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And so there is no need for me to testify." The jury was not present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Epstein, the elusive financier who pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges, was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 but died by suicide in prison a month later. Maxwell, his close companion and longtime associate, was arrested in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Prosecution links Maxwell to Epstein                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , While the four women's testimony is the crux of the charges, the prosecution has also focused on closely linking Maxwell to Epstein. For example, the prosecution showed a series of photos to jurors of the two embracing and smiling together over the years, including several images of her massaging his foot.                                                                                                                                                                                           , In closing arguments, the prosecution said that close relationship was key to the abuse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "When you're with someone for 11 years, you know what they like," Moe said. "Epstein liked underaged girls. He liked to touch underaged girls. Maxwell knew it. Make no mistake, Maxwell was crucial to the whole scheme. Epstein could not have done this alone."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Maxwell normalized physical touch and sexuality to the alleged victims she groomed for Epstein, the prosecution argued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "A single middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch, to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy," Moe told jurors. "But when that man is accompanied by a posh, smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that's when everything starts to seem legitimate. And when that woman encourages those girls to massage that man, when she acts like it's totally normal for the man to touch those girls. It lures them into a trap. It allows the man to silence the alarm bells.", Jurors again saw pages from Epstein and Maxwell's "little black book with their victims' names in it" recovered from Epstein's home.

They proved to us that he was a master manipulator. That has nothing to do with Ghislaine and everything to do with Jeffrey Epstein. We are not here to defend Jeffrey Epstein. He is not my client," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Menninger suggested several theories in attempts to undermine the four women who testified they were abused. She theorized that they may be misremembering or lying for their personal gain, that they added Maxwell to their stories at the government's suggestion, and that the abuse may have happened years later when they were above the age of consent.                                                                                                                                               , "The money brought the accusers to the FBI, with their personal injury lawyers sitting right there next to them. The lawyers manipulated their stories, and the government accepted those stories at face value. Without ever testing them or corroborating them or checking with other witnesses to see if they were accurate," Menninger said.                                                                                                                                                              , The defense attorney went through the testimony of each accuser and questioned their "highly flawed" memories of decades-old allegations, highlighting the inconsistencies in their timelines and their previous interviews with law enforcement. Two of the victims, Carolyn and "Jane," did not mention Maxwell in their initial law enforcement interviews, according to trial testimony.                                                                                                                  , "Why would you go decades without mentioning Ghislaine Maxwell and suddenly when you have your personal injury lawyer you add her to the mix?" Menninger said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Menninger also suggested Maxwell herself was manipulated by Epstein, who showed her only parts of his life so she didn't know anything about Epstein's sexual proclivities or crimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "It was clear Epstein was a manipulator of everyone around him," Menninger said. "Someone like Jeffrey Epstein is always trying to control the people around them -- use his position to manipulate people and play them off against one another."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , CNN's Holly Yan, Dakin Andone and Travis Caldwell contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on UK 10-year government bond dropped back below 0.75%, moving towards an over three-month low of 0.7% hit on December 13th, as concerns over a surge in cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in Europe offset expectations of faster tightening policy by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. British Health Minister Sajid Javid declined to rule out further restrictions before Christmas, while UK government's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance told ministers at the weekend that new measures should be introduced as soon as possible to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. In addition, several countries have announced restrictions for travelers arriving from the UK. </td>

Also, persistent foreign outflows following tighter monetary policies by several central banks amid surging inflation weakened the investor sentiment.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures fell 4% to trade below $71 per barrel on Monday, the lowest in over two weeks as traders reassessed the demand outlook amid rising Covid cases globally, with the highly transmissible omicron variant prompting fresh lockdowns in some countries. The Netherlands led the way by imposing a nationwide lockdown on Sunday and the possibility of more Covid restrictions being introduced ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays loomed over several European countries. The International Energy Agency previously warned that a surge in Covid cases would dent global oil demand at a time when supply is set to increase, especially in the US. Energy services firm Baker Hughes Co reported on Friday that US oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by three to 579 in the week to Dec. 17, rising for a second week and reaching its highest level since April 2020. </td>

Output accelerated for all subindices, including manufacturing (13 percent vs 5.5 percent in October), electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply (47.7 percent vs 40.6 percent), mining and quarrying (4 percent vs 2.4 percent), and water supply; sewerage waste management and remediation activities (12.5 percent vs 10.7 percent).

Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, traded around $71 a barrel, the lowest in two weeks as the rapidly spreading omicron coronavirus variant threatens demand. On the monetary policy front, officials in Russia raised interest rates by 100bps last week to curb inflation and left the door open to further hikes. </td>

US Fed Governor Chris Waller said last week that he thought a rate increase in March would be "very likely" while the central bank should also begin reducing its balance sheet in mid-2022. The US Fed said at its December meeting it would speed up its tapering of bond purchases, putting it on track to conclude it in March 2022 and paving the way for three interest rate hikes by the end of next year. </td>

Current: $4,891 (389%) 
Goal: $1,000,000 sometime around February 
- 1 Trade a day
- Only SPY options
——————————————————————
Today’s SPY trade was fairly simple once again and was executed as expected.

Picked up some longer dated options as well for the new year outside of the challenge, easy to predict market lately and it has been obeying key levels to the tee. 

Just taking the challenge day by day helps, starts small but compounding is no joke, let’s keep building baby.

Another day in the books 

$1k -&amp;gt; $1m options challenge update 🚀

Start: $1,000
Current: $4,891 (389%) 
Goal: $1,000,000 sometime around February 
- 1 Trade a day
- Only SPY options
——————————————————————
Today’s SPY trade was fairly simple once again and was executed as expected.

Picked up some longer dated options as well for the new year outside of the challenge, easy to predict market lately and it has been obeying key levels to the tee. 

Just taking the challenge day by day helps, starts small but compounding is no joke, let’s keep building baby.

The US stock market will be closed all day Friday in observation of Christmas Day.

The US bond market will close Thursday at 2p EST, and close Friday too. 

Between now and then, inflation data will be the Key focus. This will especially be so following the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision and updated economic and interest rate outlooks, which showed it now sees the potential for 3 interest rate hikes in Y 2022, based on its Summary of Economic Projections...

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY the thing is a variant like omicron signals nearing the end of the pandemic because it’s a two sided weapon. It’s mutated so much it’s weakened and it’s so transmissible that nearly everyone will catch it so heard immunity combined with a weakening virus is the end the risk to markets is in that small window whether it’s a few weeks or months where the country and globe gets slammed it can be quite volatile due to uncertainty of how many serious cases and things like shutdowns to economy ,sports, schools etc. if we get strong positive leadership and communication from the administration and we get Pfizer Covid pill news and vaccine positive news on omicron etc and more good earnings like Nike etc today we could stay strong atleast until closer to Powell raising rates. Those are the variables to look for in which way markets head. God bless have a good night $QQQ 🙏🏻🤝 </td>

Those who are still unvaccinated aren&amp;#39;t only harming their own self, they are also harming their friends, family and those good citizens who got vaccinated, etc. It is a very selfish act for those unvaccinated to pass the virus to others if they are infected. </td>

The last hour action indicates a sneaky rally is in the working.  I will not be surprised to gap up tomorrow ahead of Biden speach, wall street likes rallies &amp;quot;ahead of&amp;quot;, as if they don&amp;#39;t know what he has to say. 
If that happens then we are likely to come down to restest the lows either Thursday or Next Monday. The low is very likely there, but very diffcult to be highly confident. In all cases it is few points away from today&amp;#39;s lows.  IMO of course. </td>

Must read about NIO the garbage...

People say the lower the stock goes the buy.

When it was @ $43 it looks cheap we bought.  then at $32 it looks cheaper and we wnated a rebound.  then  at $28 it&amp;#39;s even weaker don&amp;#39;t buy because tomorrow you can buy for less...  so wait for  $22 gap to fill

At $22 it will look ugly and weaker ,not a buy , at $15 you say why should i buy if i can get it  for 20% less at $12.  
   

CHINESE COMPANY. COULD TANK TO $22 GAP OR $15 OR $8 GAP
chinese don&amp;#39;t have a floor, they can delist and move to HK stock market. they will dilute , nio did and will do it again.
This is what i think will be the next news....delisting 

Now we expect for a poor sales @ 2022,   beacuse many will cancel the ET7 pre order, get the refound of (worth 150us)  and make a pre order of Et5 for next year with 25k us less, you get almost the same car with 25k us less , a lot of ,money. NIO made a huge mistake.
Also, Tesla could come with a $25k  car and kill nio. </td>

When you short attack this stock, you see how dented is moving average and the momentum is diverging away from moving up ..

This is not going to look good for bears.

Why? Once it goes up, momentum will go opposite direction meaning 

Just like when price go down, it goes faster when go down in normal situation.

Now this is abnormal situation:

When the price go down, the momentum will up ward slowly just like normal stock

It will take years to go down while it will be faster to go up due to disruption in momentum shift!

That’s why shorting is bad when you try to disrupt algo.

Don’t do it.. otherwise it’s game over for bears! </td>

Cover your shorts before too late!

Shorting is ugly in the end with huge money loss.

Between 2017 and 2021, investors shorting Tesla lost $52 billion; when going back to 2010, the number is closer to $57 billion. 

GameStop short sellers, by contrast, lost an estimated $8.4 billion, according to data from US exchanges analyzed by S3.

===================================================
Shares of Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) are up  Monday after the company presented preliminary data on how the third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine protects against the emerging Omicron variant.

The data showed that the booster significantly raises antibody levels. Half of the booster dose raised the level of antibodies 37-fold, Moderna said this morning. The full dose raised antibody levels by 83-fold.

“The dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases from the Omicron variant is concerning to all. However, these data showing that the currently authorized Moderna COVID-19 booster can boost neutralizing antibody levels 37-fold higher than pre-boost levels are reassuring,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. </td>

Holiday promo, this only lasts until December 23rd. Any of these stocks could be valued at up to $2000. So that&amp;#39;s potentially a big deal.  No worries either way, but wouldn&amp;#39;t want you to miss this if you want the free stocks.  I find Webull quite useful: I use their real time tools even when I&amp;#39;m trading somewhere else.

I guess every person with just a little bit of common sense understands that COVID and it&amp;#39;s variants are part of our life forever. Our life, lives of our children, grandchildren etc. There will be new pesky variants every 6 months. So what? Every six months sell-off  in stonks and then rally to new ATH-s? </td>

Angry owner blows up his Tesla (VIDEO)

https://www.rt.com/news/543738-tesla-explosion-musk-finland/

A Finnish man who was shocked by the cost of a battery replacement for his Tesla Model S decided that blowing up his electric car with an Elon Musk dummy inside would be a more suitable solution.

The owner said that he lost his faith in Musk’s company after he was told to pay 20,000 euros (around $22,500) for a new battery for his car. He was apparently among the early buyers of the Tesla Model S, which had been around since 2012, so his warranty had already expired.

The man was unwilling to part with such a massive sum, instead contacting bloggers from the local Pommijätkät channel on YouTube, who specialize in blowing stuff up.

Before the explosion, a mannequin with the face of the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, was placed in the driver’s seat.
