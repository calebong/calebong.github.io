His silhouette was a kind of inverse triangle with giant shoulders and a nipped waist. He loved latex, leather, and curves.                                                                                                                                                                              , His early muses included Grace Jones and Joey Arias. He had a longstanding creative collaboration with David Bowie, and even dressed him for his wedding to Iman. His unprecious sensibility led him from couture to putting together a tremendously successful Cirque Du Soleil show in Las Vegas. Long after he went into a state of semiretirement in the early 2000s, his perfume “Angel remained wildly successful., Alexander McQueen’s punk posh sensibility owed much credit to Mr. Mugler’s work. As did Lady Gaga’s early “Bad Romance” look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Mr. Mugler was also known to have dressed some of the biggest names in Hollywood and beyond, and made something of a comeback in 2019 by dressing Kim Kardashian for the Met Gala. The “wet dress” Mr. Mugler designed for Ms. Kardashian introduced him to millions of new fans.                                                                                                                                       , His current creative director Casey Cadwallader said, “Manfred, I am so honored to have known you and to work within your beautiful world. You changed our perception of beauty, of confidence, of representation, and self empowerment. Your legacy is something I carry with me in everything I do. Thank you.”                                                                                                       , A full obituary will appear shortly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Christine Chung contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Advertisement </td>

"Depending on the industry, telling people they have to be vaccinated maybe just wouldn't work."                                                                                                                                        , But as Covid-19 continues to resist containment, Dr Levin Scherz warns the pandemic may yet force company hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Employer vaccine mandates do work to get to near universal rates of vaccination," he says.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Japan Private Sector Shrinks for 1st Time in 4 Months </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The au Jibun Bank Japan Composite PMI dropped to 48.8 in January 2022 from a final 51.8 a month earlier, a flash reading showed. This marked the first contraction in the private sector since September 2021, amid a surge in COVID-19 cases from the Omicron strain. Services activity declined the most since last August,  as curbs were re-introduced across various prefectures including the capital Tokyo; while manufacturers saw a slight quickening in output growth. Both production and new orders fell after growing in December, while employment shrank for the first time in a year with backlogs of works decreasing following a rise in the prior month. Meanwhile, export sales growth accelerated, amid signs of improving global demand. At the same time,  it appeared that price pressures may have peaked as firms noted a softening in input price inflation for the first time in five months while output cost eased. Finally, sentiment hit its lowest in a year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Futures Rise Ahead of More Earnings, Fed Meeting </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures rose slightly on Monday following last week’s sharp losses, as investors awaited more earnings reports and a key policy decision from the Federal Reserve. Dow futures edged up 0.4%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. The major averages sold off broadly last week amid mixed earnings and concerns over higher interest rates, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting a 7.55% weekly loss and sitting about 15% off its November peak. The S&amp;P 500 also fell 5.68% last week and the Dow lost 4.58%. While more than 70% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results topped Wall Street estimates, a couple of key names including Goldman Sachs and Netflix disappointed investors last week. Companies slated to report earnings this week, meanwhile, include Apple, Microsoft and Tesla. Investors were also dumping risk assets on prospects of tighter monetary settings, as the looming Fed meeting which concludes on Wednesday is eyed for fresh policy signals. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The people deciding to ditch their smartphones </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In a world where many of us are glued to our smartphones, Dulcie Cowling is something of an anomaly - she has ditched hers.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The 36-year-old decided at the end of last year that getting rid of her handset would improve her mental health. So, over Christmas she told her family and friends that she was switching to an old Nokia phone that could only make and receive calls and text messages.                                      , She recalls that one of the pivotal moments that led to her decision was a day at the park with her two boys, aged six and three: "I was on my mobile at a playground with the kids and I looked up and every single parent - there was up to 20 - were looking at their phones, just scrolling away," she says., "I thought 'when did this happen?'. Everyone is missing out on real life. I don't think you get to your death bed and think you should have spent more time on Twitter, or reading articles online."                                                                                                            , Ms Cowling, who is a creative director at London-based advertising agency Hell Yeah!, adds that the idea to abandon her smartphone had built up during the Covid lockdowns.                                                                                                                                     , "I thought about how much of my life is spent looking at the phone and what else could I do. Being constantly connected to lots of services creates a lot of distractions, and is a lot for the brain to process."                                                                                              , She plans to use the time gained from quitting her smartphone to read and sleep more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , About nine out of 10 people in the UK now own a smartphone, a figure broadly replicated across the developed world. And we are glued to them - one recent study found that the average person spends 4.8 hours a day on their handset.                                                                          , Yet a small, but growing number of people, enough is enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Alex Dunedin binned his smartphone two years ago. "Culturally we have become addicted to these tools," says the educational researcher and technology expert. "They are blunting cognition and impeding productivity."                                                                                          , Mr Dunedin, who lives and works in Scotland, says another reason behind his decision was environmental concerns. "We are wasting exponential amounts of energy producing exponential amounts of CO2 emissions," he says.                                                                                        , He has become happier and more productive since he stopped using a smartphone, he says. Mr Dunedin doesn't even have an old-fashioned mobile phone or even a landline anymore. He is instead only electronically contactable via emails to his home computer.                                                   , "It has improved my life," he says. "My thoughts are freed up from constantly being cognitively connected to a machine that I need to feed with energy and money. I think that the danger of technologies is that they are emptying our lives."                                                                 , Lynne Voyce, a 53-year-old teacher and writer from Birmingham, has moved in the opposite direction - she started using a smartphone again last August after a break of six years.                                                                                                                               , She says she was reluctantly compelled to buy one again due to having to deal with QR codes in restaurants, and so-called Covid passports, plus making it easier to keep in touch with one of her daughters who lives in Paris.                                                                                 , But she plans to give up it up again, if she can. "After the pandemic, and when Ella [her eldest daughter] isn't living abroad, I might try and give it up again. It sounds like an addiction, doesn't it?"                                                                                                     , When Ms Voyce first abandoned her smartphone back in 2016 it was to help encourage her daughters to reduce the time they spent on their handsets.                                                                                                                                                               , "They were glued to their phones. I thought the only way to stop it was to get rid of my own phone. And it made all the difference.                                                                                                                                                                             , "For example, we'd got to a restaurant, and they would no longer see me pick up my phone."                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Not having a smartphone "took a lot of pressure off my brain" she says, "I didn't feel like I had to instantly answer things or be available when out".                                                                                                                                                         , Yet, while some worry about how much time they spend on their handset, for millions of others they are a godsend.                                                                                                                                                                                               , "More than ever, access to healthcare, education, social services and often to our friends and family is digital, and the smartphone is an essential lifeline for people," says a spokesperson for UK mobile network Vodafone.                                                                                  , "We also create resources to help people get the most from their tech, as well as to stay safe when they're online - that's hugely important."                                                                                                                                                                  , However, Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook, says there is a strong link between heavy device usage and relationship issues, quality of sleep, our ability to switch off and relax, and concentration levels.                                                            , "Many people have a constant drip feed of requests coming their way via their device, many with a false sense of urgency.                                                                                                                                                                                       , "They feel unable to lay boundaries down, with the result that they feel compelled to check their emails and messages last thing at night and first thing in the morning."                                                                                                                                      , If getting rid of your smartphone seems too much but you are concerned that you spend too much time on it, there are other measures you can take to reduce your usage.                                                                                                                                          , While it might initially seen counterintuitive, more apps are emerging to curtail mindless scrolling.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , For example, Freedom lets you temporarily block apps and websites so you can focus more.

"Starting to realise exactly how much time you're frittering away each day on your phone can be a powerful wake-up call and catalyst for change."                                                       , She also advises carving out short periods when you have your phone switched off or left at home, and gradually increase the wait period till you check it again.                                                                                                                                               , Finally, she recommends choosing an image or a word that represents what you would rather be doing - if only you had more time - as your phone's screensaver.                                                                                                                                                   , "Considering most of us check our phones 55 times per day and some of us even 100 times, this is a great visual reminder of a more valuable way to spend your precious time," she says.                                                                                                                         , Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The extraordinary rise and fall of underworld boss Paul Massey                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , © 2022 BBC.

U.S. citizens in Ukraine should consider departing now using commercial or other privately available transportation options," the State Department said in a statement., CNN reported on Friday that the embassy had requested that the State Department take this step as Russia has continued to mass forces and equipment near Ukraine's borders, sparking fears of a renewed invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The Ukrainian Defense Ministry's latest intelligence assessment, shared with CNN this week, assessed that Russia has now deployed more than 127,000 troops in the region. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week that Russia was in a position to launch an invasion "at any point."                                                                                                                   , The State Department has already issued the highest-level travel advisory for Ukraine, telling Americans not to travel to the country and to be aware of reports that Russia is planning for significant military action against Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                            , US officials still don't know what Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans are or whether he has even decided to invade. But some officials who have seen the intelligence say there is evidence that Russia is planning to try to take Kyiv and overthrow the government, as CNN has previously reported.                                                                                                          , The UK foreign office said in a statement on Saturday that it has information the Russian government is planning to "install a pro-Russian leader in Kyiv as it considers whether to invade and occupy Ukraine."                                                                                                                                                                                                     , This story has been updated with additional information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stock futures rise following S&amp;P 500's worst week since March 2020 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Stock futures rose slightly in overnight trading Sunday, following the S&amp;P 500's worst week since March 2020, as investors awaited more corporate earnings results and a key policy decision from the Federal Reserve.                                                                                                                              , Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures climbed 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.9%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The overnight action followed a brutal week on Wall Street in the face of mixed company earnings and worries about rising interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 lost 5.7% last week and closed below its 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the first time since June 2020. The blue-chip Dow fell 4.6% for its worst week since October 2020., The sell-off in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was even more severe with the benchmark dropping 7.6% last week, notching its fourth straight weekly loss. The index now sits more than 14% below its November record close, falling deeper into correction territory.                                                                              , The fourth-quarter earnings season has been a mixed bag. While more than 70% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results have topped Wall Street estimates, a couple of key firms let down investors last week, including Goldman Sachs and Netflix.                                                                                            , "What had initially been a stimulus withdrawal-driven decline morphed last week to include earnings jitters," Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. "So investors are now worried not just about the multiple placed on earnings, but the EPS forecasts themselves."                                                         , IBM is set to report numbers after the bell Monday. Investors will also digest a slew of high-stakes Big Tech earnings, including Microsoft, Tesla and Apple.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Another crucial market driver will be the Fed's policy meeting, which wraps up on Wednesday. Investors are anxious to find out any signals on how much the central bank will raise interest rates this year and when it will start.                                                                                                                 , Goldman Sachs said Sunday that its baseline forecast calls for four rate hikes this year, but the bank sees a risk for more rate increases due to the surge in inflation.                                                                                                                                                                           , Investors are dumping riskier assets this year as they brace for the Fed to tighten monetary policy. Bitcoin dropped more than 8% over the weekend to trade around $35,511 apiece, wiping out nearly half of its value at its record high reached in November.                                                                                      , Meanwhile, bond yields have surged in the new year in anticipation of Fed rate hikes, which partly triggered the drastic sell-off in growth-oriented tech shares. While the 10-year Treasury yield finished last week lower around 1.76%, the benchmark rate has jumped about a quarter of a percentage point in 2022.                              , "The big story so far in 2022 has been the rapid move higher in interest rates, which is prompting investors to re-assess valuations for some of the most expensive segments of the market and rotate into value stocks," said David Lefkowitz, head of equities Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.                                          , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australia Private Sector Activity Shrinks </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Australia Composite PMI dropped sharply to 45.3 in January of 2022 from 54.9 in December, pointing to the first contraction in private sector activity in four months due to the latest surge in COVID-19 infections as operations were disrupted, flash estimates showed. The services sector slipped into contraction (45 vs 55.1) and manufacturing growth slowed sharply (55.3 vs 57.7). Private sector output and demand both declined in January which led to employment growth grinding to a halt. Meanwhile, amid the disruptions backlogged work continued to build while input price inflation rose. Business optimism was likewise affected, falling sharply to the lowest since April 2020 with concerns reported surrounding the elevated COVID-19 infections and lingering supply chain issues. </td>

After emphatic resistance from investors and analysts — one analyst titled his research note about the deal “Please Don’t” — over concerns about price and ability to integrate the business, Unilever said it would not raise its takeover bid, effectively walking away., Unilever has said that it wants to focus more on higher-growth businesses like beauty, health and hygiene, and that it would sell slower-growing businesses. The company has already taken steps toward that, including through its deal last year to sell global tea brands like Lipton and Tazo.                                                                                                                            , And two years ago, it moved to consolidate its vast consumer goods empire in London, abandoning its second headquarters in Amsterdam to simplify its operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Even before the GlaxoSmithKline bid, another of Unilever’s top shareholders, the investment firm Fundsmith, criticized the company for focusing too much on climate- and social-focused causes, and said the company had neglected its fundamental businesses.                                                                                                                                                                , Unilever now faces a potential new threat in Trian, known for writing detailed analyses of the operations of its shareholder activism targets. (Its so-called white paper on G.E. ran to 80 pages.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Trian is known for pushing for companies to simplify their corporate structures, often through divesting underperforming businesses. At P.&amp;G., for example, Trian argued that the consumer goods giant should cut costs and layers of bureaucracy, though not necessarily that it should sell off divisions.                                                                                                                  , Mr. Peltz eventually gained a board seat at P.&amp;G. in 2017, after waging what was the most expensive board fight on record. He finally stepped down last year, with P.&amp;G.’s shares up significantly from when Trian first began calling for changes.                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australia Services Sector Slips into Contraction </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Australia Services PMI slumped to 45 in January of 2022 from 55.1 in December, pointing to the first contraction in the services sector in four months, flash estimates showed. Amid the surge in COVID-19 infections, both services demand and activity declined. New export orders slipped at a sharper rate in tandem and employment levels similarly fell, albeit marginally. Anecdotal evidence suggested that both COVID-19 disruptions and hiring difficulties contributed to the drop. Cost pressures meanwhile persisted with input price inflation climbing to a record. Selling price inflation however eased as demand dropped. Overall optimism nevertheless sustained but had eased to the lowest level since April 2020. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australia Factory Growth at 5-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Australia Manufacturing PMI fell to 55.3 in January of 2022 from 57.7 in December, pointing to the slowest growth in factory activity in 5 months, flash estimates showed. New order growth eased while output slipped into contraction for the first time in five months. Although demand persisted in growth, manufacturers reported a slowdown in production, affected by the shortages of inputs, labour constraints and other COVID-19 disruptions. Suppliers’ delivery times lengthened at a more severe rate, implicated by the worsening of COVID-19 conditions. This led to firms ramping up their input purchases with intentions of safety stock building. Meanwhile hiring activities decelerated with panellists reporting difficulties in securing labour. Price pressures showed signs of easing across both input costs and output prices. Overall sentiment amongst manufacturers, while positive, fell due to concerns over COVID-19 and supply chain issues. </td>

Employees at about 20 other Starbucks have since filed for union elections.                                                                                                                                                                                             , The filing at the REI store in SoHo asked the labor board for an election involving about 115 employees, who are seeking to be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, the same union that has overseen the union campaign at the Amazon warehouse in Alabama.                                                                                                                                                , In addition to filing for the election, the REI employees have asked for voluntary recognition of their union, which would make a vote unnecessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Like Starbucks, REI, a consumer cooperative made up of customers who buy lifetime memberships for $20, cultivates a progressive image. REI’s website says that the cooperative believes in “putting purpose before profits” and that it invests more than 70 percent of its profits “back into the outdoor community” through initiatives like dividends to members and employee profit-sharing.                                       , The site also says that REI closes all of its roughly 170 stores, none of which are currently unionized, on Black Friday to allow employees to spend the day with family and friends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The retailer has more than 15,000 employees in the United States, compared with more than 230,000 at roughly 9,000 U.S. Starbucks locations that are owned by the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In a statement, Graham Gale, an employee involved in union organizing at the SoHo REI store, said the campaign was partly a response to “a tangible shift in the culture at work that doesn’t seem to align with the values that brought most of us here.”                                                                                                                                                                             , The statement also pointed to “the new struggle of facing unsafe working conditions during a global pandemic.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In a follow-up text, Mx. Gale, who prefers gender-neutral courtesy titles and pronouns, said REI declined to bring back some long-tenured employees who had been outspoken about workplace concerns after the retailer temporarily closed its stores in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                          , Since the beginning of the pandemic, some REI employees have criticized the retailer over what they say are insufficient safety protocols, including a lack of transparency over which employees have tested positive for Covid and a decision to relax its masking policy. The retailer has said that it follows relevant guidance from state and federal health authorities, but it has adjusted some policies as it faced criticism., Responding to the union campaign in Manhattan, REI said in a statement: “We respect the rights of our employees to speak and act for what they believe — and that includes the rights of employees to choose or refuse union representation. However, we do not believe placing a union between the co-op and its employees is needed or beneficial.”                                                                                  , The statement went on to say that the co-op was committed to working with employees at the SoHo store to resolve their concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Despite the organizing efforts at companies like Amazon and Starbucks last year, membership in unions declined to 10.3 percent of the work force, matching its lowest figure in Labor Department records that date back to 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Advertisement </td>

Trump called for scrapping laws that offer the news media broad protection from libel suits — “We’re going to have people sue you like you’ve never got sued before,” he said in 2016 as he was running for president — many journalists and the lawyers who defend them brushed it off as an empty threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But a libel case that begins Monday in federal court in Lower Manhattan, Sarah Palin v. The New York Times Company, shines a spotlight on the many ways that Mr. Trump’s seemingly far-fetched wish may no longer be so unthinkable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A lot has changed in the country’s political and legal landscape since Ms. Palin, a former Alaska governor, filed her suit in 2017. It alleges that The Times defamed her with an editorial that incorrectly asserted a link between her political rhetoric and a mass shooting near Tucson, Ariz., in 2011 that left six people dead and 14 wounded, including Gabrielle Giffords, then a Democratic member of Congress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The editorial was published on June 14, 2017, the same day that a gunman opened fire at a baseball field where Republican congressmen were practicing, injuring several people including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana. The headline was “America’s Lethal Politics,” and the editorial asked whether the Virginia shooting was evidence of how vicious American politics had become.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , As it first appeared, the editorial then argued that “the link to political incitement was clear” between the 2011 Giffords shooting and a map circulated by Ms. Palin’s political action committee that showed 20 congressional districts that Republicans were hoping to pick up. Those districts, including the one held by Ms. Giffords, were displayed under stylized cross hairs. In correcting the editorial, The Times said it had “incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting.”                                                                                                                  , Those who argue that media outlets should pay a steeper legal price when they get something wrong or make a mistake are more emboldened now than at any point since the landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision in The New York Times Company v. Sullivan. That ruling set a high bar for public officials to prove defamation: They had to show not only that a report was inaccurate and harmed their reputation, but that those who produced it had acted with “actual malice,” meaning they displayed a reckless disregard for the truth or knew it was false.                                                                                        , The Palin case, being tried in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, won’t directly deal with larger constitutional issues. The jury will weigh testimony and evidence that is expected to offer a rare, under-the-hood glimpse at the often messy process of how daily journalism is produced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Most libel suits against The Times are dismissed before they ever reach a jury, making this case particularly uncommon. Though defenders of broad First Amendment protections for the media have said Ms. Palin’s evidence is weak, they also acknowledged that a jury could decide otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “The case will come down to whether the jury — as juries sometimes do — will decide based on their likes and impressions of the parties,” said George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center and a former lawyer for The Times, “or whether they will actually follow the actual malice rules the judge will give them.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But those fundamental First Amendment issues loom over the trial. And lawyers for Ms. Palin, through legal briefs and public statements, have made no secret of the fact that they want to see the courts rethink the legal leeway that media organizations have to make an unintentional error. The law currently considers an occasional mistake a natural result of a free press.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Some First Amendment scholars, politicians and judges, mostly but not exclusively conservative, have started to press their case more boldly for unwinding the bedrock precedent set by the Sullivan case, saying it has not kept pace with the changing nature of news and public commentary. These include two Supreme Court justices, Clarence Thomas, who suggested in 2019 that Sullivan was not grounded in the original meaning of the Constitution, and Neil M. Gorsuch, who wrote last summer that the standard has “evolved into an ironclad subsidy for the publication of falsehoods.”                                                     , At the same time, some Republicans are using defamation allegations against journalists with an aggressiveness that media advocates say is without precedent — from the Trump campaign’s since-dismissed suit against The Times in 2020 for a critical opinion piece to former Representative Devin Nunes’s ongoing case against a reporter now working for Politico who posted to Twitter an article that Mr. Nunes said defamed his family.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The heart of The Times’s defense in the Palin case is that the error in the editorial was not a case of actual malice but a mistake made under a tight and routine production deadline that was corrected after it was pointed out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The statements that Ms. Palin argues were defamatory were introduced during the editing process by James Bennet, who was then the editorial page editor for The Times.

And she said she is looking at the Palin case as a test of how harshly a jury — in today’s tribal political climate — will judge media companies for their mistakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Ms. Palin’s suit was initially dismissed by the judge, Jed S. Rakoff, soon after it was filed. But a three-judge appeals court panel overturned that decision in 2019 and reinstated the case. Elizabeth Locke, who represented Ms. Palin during the appeal but is no longer involved in the case, has argued on behalf of several high-profile clients in defamation suits against major media outlets and been at the forefront of the conservative effort to make the rethinking of libel laws more mainstream. Ms. Locke said in an interview that while the Sullivan precedent is not worth scrapping entirely, it fails in today’s media culture., “How do you balance free speech rights with the right to your individual reputation, and in the context of public officials who have volunteered for public service and do need to be held to account?” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “Redrawing that balance does not mean that we lock up journalists or that any falsehood should result in a huge jury verdict,” Ms. Locke added. “But imposing the potential for legal liability, which is virtually nonexistent with the Sullivan standard in place, would create self-restraint.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ms. Palin’s lawyers have argued that Mr. Bennet had to know that there was no evidence that her political rhetoric incited the shooter and that he had a “preconceived storyline” and harbored ill-will toward the pro-gun rights former governor in part because his brother, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, is a Democrat who favors gun control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The Times has denied those allegations, rebutting the notions that it would ever knowingly print something false and that Mr. Bennet was acting out of spite. “We published an editorial about an important topic that contained an inaccuracy. We set the record straight with a correction,” a spokeswoman for The Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said. “We are deeply committed to fairness and accuracy in our journalism, and when we fall short, we correct our errors publicly, as we did in this case.”                                                                                                                                           , A lawyer for Ms. Palin did not respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr. Bennet left the paper in 2020 after the newspaper’s opinion section published an Op-Ed by Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, calling for a military response to civic unrest in American cities.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 'Shameless,' former NBC host says of the Olympics returning to Beijing  - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN)Former NBC sportscaster Bob Costas, who has covered 12 Olympic Games as a host and commentator, did not hold back when discussing the challenges journalists will face during the Beijing Winter Olympics next month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "The IOC deserves all of the disdain and disgust that comes their way for going back to China yet again," Costas said on CNN's  "Reliable Sources" Sunday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Costas referenced the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and the 2015 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia as examples of the International Olympic Committee's seeming disregard for the prevalence of human rights abuses when selecting host nations. But now, there's a  "greater understanding of everything that China represents," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,  "They're shameless about this stuff," Costas said of the IOC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Journalists will face a unique challenge during the Beijing games — balancing politics and sports, CNN's chief media correspondent Brian Stelter said, adding that there are many unknowns in terms of censorship and how free international journalists will be when it comes to reporting on events in and around the games.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Some journalists heading to Beijing are taking precautions like bringing burner phones and laptops," Stelter said, referencing an earlier Washington Post story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , There is a lot of money on the line — NBCUniversal has a $12 billion contract to broadcast the Olympics through 2023. And both NBC and ESPN announced this week they will not be sending their usual contingent of reporters and producers to the Games due to Covid concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , NBC previously announced it would include geopolitical context during its Beijing coverage, but that its focus will be on the athletes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "We are going to be focusing on telling the stories of Team USA and covering the competition," Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production, said during a presentation to reporters Wednesday. "But the world, as we all know, is a really complicated place right now. And we understand that there's some difficult issues regarding the host nation."                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Costas, acknowledging his respect for the challenges his former colleagues will face in Beijing, described Olympics reporting as a sort of "quasi journalism."  That's because NBC pays a massive rights fee along with the production costs, putting the network in a somewhat promotional position for the Games. He added that covering the Olympics isn't simply a news event, but also an important "cultural panorama" and  "travel log" of the host nation, aspects that could be greatly reduced because of Covid and the potential for constant monitoring by Chinese authorities., "It's a centerpiece of the entire network strategy at a time where everything is fractionalized," Costas said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , During the fanfare of the Games, Stelter asked how viewers should expect the geopolitical context to be covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "I would anticipate ... [NBC] will acknowledge the issues at the beginning," Costas said, "and then address them only if something specific that cannot be ignored happens during the course of the Games."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Inflation surge could push the Fed into more than four rate hikes this year, Goldman Sachs says </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Accelerating inflation could cause the Federal Reserve to get even more aggressive than economists expect in the way it raises interest rates this year, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                         , With the market already expecting four quarter-percentage-point hikes this year, Goldman economist David Mericle said the omicron spread is aggravating price increases and could push the Fed into a faster pace of rate increases.                                                                                                                                                    , "Our baseline forecast calls for four hikes in March, June, September, and December," Mericle said in a Saturday note to clients. "But we see a risk that the [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to take some tightening action at every meeting until the inflation picture changes."                                                                                           , The report comes just a few days ahead of the policymaking group's two-day meeting starting on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Markets expect no action regarding interest rates following the gathering but do figure the committee will tee up a hike coming in March. If that happens, it will be the first increase in the central bank's benchmark rate since December 2018.                                                                                                                                      , Raising interest rates would be a way to head off spiking inflation, which is running at its highest 12-month pace in nearly 40 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Mericle said that economic complications from the Covid spread have aggravated imbalances between booming demand and constrained supplies. Secondly, wage growth is continuing to run at high levels, particularly at lower-paying jobs, even though enhanced unemployment benefits have expired and the labor market should have loosened up.                                          , "We see a risk that the FOMC will want to take some tightening action at every meeting until that picture changes," Mericle wrote. "This raises the possibility of a hike or an earlier balance sheet announcement in May, and of more than four hikes this year."                                                                                                                      , Traders are pricing in nearly a 95% chance of a rate increase at the March meeting, and a more than 85% chance of four moves in all of 2022, according to CME data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , However, the market also is now starting to tilt to a fifth hike this year, which would be the most aggressive Fed that investors have seen going back to the turn of the century and the efforts to tamp down the dot-com bubble. Chances of a fifth rate increase have moved to nearly 60%, according to the CME's FedWatch gauge.                                                    , In addition to hiking rates, the Fed also is winding down its monthly bond-buying program, with March as the current date to end an effort that has more than doubled the central bank balance sheet to just shy of $9 trillion. While some market participants have speculated that the Fed could shut down the program at next week's meeting, Goldman does not expect that to happen., The Fed could, though, provide more indication about when it will start unwinding its bond holdings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Goldman forecasts that process will begin in July and be done in $100 billion monthly increments. The process is expected to run for 2 or 2½ years and shrink the balance sheet to a still-elevated $6.1 trillion to $6.6 trillion. The Fed likely will allow some proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off each month rather than selling the securities outright, Mericle said.       , However, the unexpectedly strong and durable inflation run has posed upside risks to forecasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "We also increasingly see a good chance that the FOMC will want to deliver some tightening action at its May meeting, when the inflation dashboard is likely to remain quite hot," Mericle wrote. "If so, that could ultimately lead to more than four rate hikes this year."                                                                                                           , There are a few key economic data points out this week, though they will come after the Fed meets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Fourth-quarter GDP is out Thursday, with economists expecting growth around 5.8%, while the personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is due out Friday and forecast to show a monthly gain of 0.5% and a year-over-year increase of 4.8%.                                                                                           , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cryptocurrencies continued their slide during the weekend, with bitcoin falling to below $35,000, losing nearly half of its value since hitting a record high of $69,000 in November. Investors are moving away from risky assets as major central banks are becoming more hawkish and many countries are cracking down on digital currencies. Meanwhile, the Etherum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell below $2400 from an all-time high of $4800 hit in November. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK Royal Navy seizes more than $20 million worth of drugs in Gulf of Oman - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The British Royal Navy has seized more than a ton of illicit drugs worth almost £15 million ($20.3 million) in the Gulf of Oman, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement on Sunday.                                                                          , "In an operation lasting almost 10 hours, a team from the warship boarded a suspect in international waters off the coast of Oman and seized 663kg of heroin, 87kg of methamphetamine and 291kg of hashish and marijuana," the statement said.                                  , "This is the largest Royal Navy drugs bust since last year, HMS Montrose seized 2.4 tons of illicit substances in the Arabian Sea," the MoD said.                                                                                                                               , A team from HMS Montrose approached a small vessel on two Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat -- where after a search they were able to collect the illicit drugs -- before proceeding to analyze and destroy them.                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , According to MoD, HMS Montrose has been deployed to the region since early 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                , The warship regularly works alongside international partners which make up the 34-nation coalition Combined Maritime Forces, which was led by the Royal New Zealand Navy at the time of the drugs bust. The leadership role has now passed to the Pakistan Navy.                , The MoD said: "The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is a multinational maritime partnership, which exists to counter illicit non-state actors.                                                                                                                                    , "This successful operation has prevented a large amount of illicit drugs from potentially reaching the UK and being sold on British streets. Organized criminals, often associated with the funding of terrorism, have also been denied a source of income," the statement said., The Commanding Officer of HMS Montrose, Commander Claire Thompson said in a statement:                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Our enduring presence never wanes.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)At least 16 people were killed after a fire tore through a nightclub in Cameroon's capital city Yaoundé early on Sunday morning, according to the country's government.                                                                                                                          , Eight other people were seriously wounded in the fire at the Liv Nightclub, according to the government's statement. During a press conference held at the scene of the fire, the director of the Yaoundé Central Hospital said several people in critical condition were transferred to the hospital. , The Cameroonian Ministry of Communication said the ceiling at the nightclub caught fire from fireworks explosions.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The fire later caused two strong explosions that sparked panic among those in the venue, according to the statement.                                                                                                                                                                                   , President Paul Biya has ordered an in-depth investigation into the incident and sent his condolences to the victims' families.                                                                                                                                                                         , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Boris Johnson is facing a make-or-break moment with report due into 'Partygate' scandal - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)It could be a crucial week for Boris Johnson in his battle to stay in power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The British Prime Minister has been under pressure for weeks over alleged summer garden parties and Christmas gatherings held in Downing Street when the rest of the country was under strict Covid-19 lockdowns. A report into the allegations, set to be released this week, could be the final straw for Johnson's increasingly mutinous party.                           , Johnson's approval ratings are plunging and there appears to be a growing sense among some parts of his ruling Conservative Party that he is becoming a liability. Two polls in the last week suggested that as many as two-thirds of voters want him to resign.                                                                                                             , The parliamentary rebellion is growing. One Conservative MP defected to the opposition Labour Party last week and newspapers have reported rumors of more lawmakers demanding Johnson's exit.                                                                                                                                                                                , The Prime Minister has given unconvincing answers when asked about the numerous parties. First he said there were none. Once undeniable evidence emerged, he denied knowing about the gatherings. When a photo of him at one such event was published, he insisted he didn't realize the gathering was a party, claiming he "believed implicitly that this was a work event.", Johnson was even forced to apologize to the Queen after it emerged that a party was held in Downing Street the night before the funeral of Prince Philip. It was noted at the time that due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Queen was forced to mourn her husband at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle while sitting alone.                                                , Adding fuel to the fire, Johnson's former senior adviser Dominic Cummings claimed this week he would swear under oath that the Prime Minister was warned about the true nature of one of the drinks parties. Johnson denied that vehemently, saying: "Nobody warned me that it was against the rules... because I would remember that."                                      , As new "Partygate" allegations emerged, Johnson and his loyalists tried to dismiss them as a "distraction," steering the conversation away. Johnson has launched an inquiry into the gatherings, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, whose report is due to come out this week, according to media reports.                                                                , Downing Street said on Sunday it had no control over when the report would appear. "It's not for us to set out when it will be published. That is up to the investigation team," a spokesperson told CNN.                                                                                                                                                                    , On Thursday, as more Conservative lawmakers openly criticized the PM about the parties, allegations emerged of blackmail and bullying by government officials.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Conservative MP William Wragg said Thursday that "a number of members of parliament have faced pressures and intimidation from members of the government because of their declared or assumed desire for a vote of confidence in the party leadership of the Prime Minister."                                                                                                , Wragg told the House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee that the reports he has been made aware of "would seem to constitute blackmail."                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Johnson dismissed the reports of bullying, saying he has "seen no evidence" to support accusations of intimidation leveled at his government by a Conservative lawmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Under Conservative party rules, if MPs want to get rid of their leader, they submit a confidential letter of no confidence to the chair of the 1922 Committee, a group of backbench MPs who do not hold government posts. The process is murky -- the letters are kept secret and the chairman, Graham Brady, doesn't even reveal how many have been handed in.              , When 15% of Conservative lawmakers have submitted letters, it triggers a vote of confidence among all Conservative lawmakers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , CNN's Luke McGee, Lauren Kent, Duarte Mendonca, Richard Allen Greene, Robert Iddiols and Sharon Braithwaite contributed to this report. </td>

"It's not surprising that both will start to become more volatile as the liquidity taps turn off."                                           , One measure of how bitcoin has become more entwined with markets: The cryptocurrency is near its highest correlation with the stock market since September 2020, according to Kaiko. That means when the stock market goes down, so does bitcoin.                                                                                        , That side-by-side movement has fluctuated over time, with long stretches when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies move according to their own impulses.                                                                                                                                                                                   , The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies among investors may have made them more sensitive to selloffs in stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , CLICK HERE FOR FOX BUSINESS' REAL-TIME CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICING DATA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The decline in bitcoin's dollar value on Friday coincided with a 20% fall in Netflix's shares, erasing more than $40 billion of market capitalization. The streaming giant said it expects to add a much smaller number of subscribers this quarter than it did a year ago.                                                              , Some analysts suggest that selloffs among popular tech stocks could prompt investors to liquidate positions in their crypto holdings to limit overall losses and meet margin calls, demands from brokers to post cash to cover possible losses on trades made with borrowed money.                                                       , BITCOIN SAGS IN 2022 UNDER WEIGHT OF STOCK SELLOFF AND FED POLICY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "We've seen exactly that happen before.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global dropped 13%. MicroStrategy, which makes business software but has invested billions of dollars in bitcoin and whose chief executive, Michael Saylor, is a vocal advocate of the cryptocurrency, shed 18%., Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com </td>

Disney began to publicly excoriate the Walt Disney Company for its “obscene” pay inequality, with Robert A. Iger, who was then chief executive, at one end of the scale and hourly theme park workers at the other. The company founded by her grandfather and great-uncle repeatedly returned fire, at one point calling her assertions a “gross and unfair exaggeration of the facts.”                                                                                                                     , But Ms. Disney has refused to back down, even though the company recently agreed to a 16 percent raise for certain theme park workers. In fact, she is escalating her campaign — and, for the first time, bringing along two of her three siblings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales,” an activist-minded documentary about the pay gap between corporate haves and have-nots, will premiere on Monday as part of the Sundance Film Festival, which is being held digitally because of the pandemic. Ms. Disney and Kathleen Hughes directed the film; Ms. Disney’s sister, Susan Disney Lord, and a brother, Tim, are among the executive producers. The movie positions the entertainment company that bears their name as “ground zero of the widening inequality in America.”   , To paint that harsh picture, Ms. Disney and Ms. Hughes profile four Disneyland custodians, who, at the time of filming (prepandemic), earned $15 an hour. They all struggle mightily with soaring housing costs in Southern California. One says he knows Disneyland workers who have had to “make a decision between medication or food.”                                                                                                                                                                                               , Intermittently, the filmmakers cut to photographs of Mr. Iger, who was Disney’s chief executive from 2005 to 2020, a period of stunning gains for stockholders (including Ms. Disney and other members of her family). Viewers are reminded that Disney awarded him a pay package in 2018 worth $65.6 million. Stock awards tied to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets made up 40 percent.                                                                                                                                       , Ms. Disney and her sister are then shown reminiscing about their grandfather, Roy O. Disney, who founded the company in 1923 with his brother, Walt. “I cannot see him taking $66 million home for a year’s work in the same year when, at the same company, people can’t afford food,” an indignant Ms. Disney says. Her sister responds, “That would never have happened — that would never have happened.”                                                                                                                            , The Disney family has not been involved in managing Disney since their father, Roy E. Disney, stepped down from the board in 2003 and led a shareholder revolt that resulted in Mr. Iger’s ascension. Roy E. Disney died in 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The New York Times was allowed to view the film ahead of its premiere. Disney, which was not given early access, responded to queries about the film’s content and tone with the following statement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “The well-being and aspirations of our employees and cast will always be our top priority. We provide a leading and holistic employment package that includes competitive pay and comprehensive benefits for our cast members to grow their careers and care for their families. That starts with fair pay and leading entry wages, but also includes affordable medical coverage, access to tuition-free higher education, subsidized child care for eligible employees, as well as pathways for personal and professional development.”, The statement added, “We are committed to building on our significant efforts to date.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Recent developments at Disneyland cut against the film’s narrative. In December, unions representing 9,500 custodians, ride operators and parking attendants ratified a new contract that lifts minimum starting pay to $18 an hour by 2023 — up from $15.45 last year, a 16 percent increase — and includes seniority-based bonuses. Disneyland has almost returned to full staffing after being closed for more than a year because of the pandemic, a spokeswoman said. The Anaheim resort employs roughly 30,000 people.             , Mr. Iger has also left the company. Ms. Disney tells viewers that she decided to make the film because she was frustrated and angry at his “curt” response to an email she sent him in 2018 about theme park employee pay. He declined to comment for this article.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Ms. Disney has faced claims of discrimination and unfair treatment from former employees at one of her companies, Level Forward, which helps finance and produce entertainment projects with a social justice focus. (“There’s fair criticism in there,” Ms. Disney told The Hollywood Reporter last year.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In an interview via Zoom, Ms. Disney and Ms. Hughes, an Emmy-winning television newsmagazine producer, said they were “encouraged” by the Disneyland pay increase but said it wasn’t enough — that around $24 an hour was the needed “living wage.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “If everything’s different, then why did the new C.E.O. walk away with $32.5 million for a not very profitable year?” Ms. Disney said. She was referring to Bob Chapek. Disney reported $2 billion in profit for 2021, compared to a loss of $2.8 billion in 2020. Before the pandemic, Disney was generating $10 billion annually in profit.                                                                                                                                                                                            , The filmmakers are still looking for a distributor. They hope to use Sundance to generate interest from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ or another Disney competitor. In addition to its condemnation of Disney, “The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales” takes on a host of complicated subjects, including the evolution of capitalism, shifting government economic policies and racial injustice.                                                                                                                           , “I want changes to the entire system — from C.E.O.s generally and from Wall Street especially — that result in the recognition of the dignity and humanity of every single worker,” Ms. Disney said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ms. Disney is a prominent member of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group that pushes for higher taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals like themselves. As she has said over the years, it is a position that some of her own family members have a difficult time understanding. (That appears to include a brother, Roy P. Disney, who has supported Mr. Iger and is not involved with “The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales.”)                                                                                                , Lest anyone think the film is her final word on the subject of pay inequality at Disney and other companies, she ends her documentary with these words: “To be continued.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> First-time buyers surge: 'I couldn't keep paying rent' </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Jake Olenick, 24, is spending almost two-thirds of his take-home pay renting a London flat but he started to get on the property ladder last year.                                                                                                 , A new job, rigorous saving and "lucky family circumstances" have enabled him to buy a share of a flat in Kilburn.                                                                                                                                  , Jake is not alone in managing to get a foot on the housing ladder in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                         , Figures from mortgage lender Halifax suggest there were a record number of first-time buyers last year, despite rising house prices and falling affordability.                                                                                     , Jake, who is originally from New York, graduated from Oxford University and got a job in Oxford working as a games developer in 2019.                                                                                                              , Six months ago, he landed a software development job in London and moved into a West Hampstead flat with his girlfriend.                                                                                                                           , That relationship broke down in October and Jake started to pay all of the rent, which worked out at about 60% of his take-home pay.                                                                                                               , "I couldn't keep paying that much in rent and I already knew that it's almost always much better to buy," he said.                                                                                                                                 , So he started the ball rolling on buying 40% of a flat in Kilburn, sharing ownership with a housing association. In total, he'll be paying 35% of his salary on rent, mortgage and service charge when he moves in.                                , He said one of the main reasons he was able to do this was "extremely lucky family circumstances".                                                                                                                                                 , His parents had been saving for him to go to a US university, which was much more expensive than a UK one, and they were able to cover his fees at Oxford.                                                                                         , So when he left, he had no student loans, which helped him when viewing properties.                                                                                                                                                                , He also managed to put aside money from his job and has been saving birthday and Christmas money his whole life.                                                                                                                                   , Jake is really looking forward to moving into his new flat.                                                                                                                                                                                        , "I'm very excited!" he says. "I'll be able to put up posters, make repairs, the oven door will close, I'll be able to sleep because the windows are insulated, triple-glazed even!                                                                 , "I'll be able to afford a weekend away, maybe I'll be able to afford a keyboard so I can play piano again.

That rate dropped by 13% in 2020, when the number of Halifax buyers was about 300,000.                                       , A stamp duty holiday that started in 2020 saw house buyers rush to pick up properties - although first-time buyers were not part of this stampede.                                                                                                 , However, this meant a number of so-called "first-rung" homes came on to the market, which first-time buyers took advantage of in 2021, despite hikes in property prices.                                                                           , Esther Dijkstra, mortgage director at Halifax, said: "There were a number of factors influencing home-buying decisions in 2021.                                                                                                                    , "While working from home and the 'race for space' was key for many, particularly movers, it's clear that the stamp duty holiday increased the availability of first-rung homes as others moved up the ladder."                                     , The average age of first-time buyers rose to 32, up from 29 in 2011. Ms Dijkstra said that this rise in average age was mostly due to "the need to save a significant deposit to get on the housing ladder".                                       , The average buyer used a £53,935 deposit on a first property costing £264,140.                                                                                                                                                                     , Because of difficulties raising a deposit, the gap between the purchase price and the deposit widened in every region in the UK, Ms Dijkstra added.                                                                                                , It's only in three local authority areas in Scotland that homes are either more affordable - in Clackmannanshire and Moray - or as affordable - in East Ayrshire, since 2011.                                                                      , Houses in the rest of the UK have become less affordable since then, Halifax said.                                                                                                                                                                 , On average, properties now cost nearly seven times the annual salary of first-time buyers.                                                                                                                                                         , The limit for affordability is considered to be four times the average income.                                                                                                                                                                     , In some areas, affordability has dropped very sharply since 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                  , In one London borough, Merton, affordability has halved, with similar drops, albeit not as pronounced, in Reigate and Banstead, South Kesteven, Westminster and Ashford.                                                                           , Anya Martin, director of campaign group PricedOut, which pushes for more affordable housing, said: "House prices and rents have been pushed out of reach by decades of failure to build enough homes.                                              , "First-time buyer schemes may help a few, but ultimately they are designed to help people stretch to high prices, rather than dealing with the cause of those high prices."                                                                        , Many first-time buyers get help from their parents to be able to afford a home, but some use a mortgage firm that was itself set up by frustrated first-time buyers.                                                                               , Retail worker Chae Sarjant is buying a home with her partner, who works for the NHS, on the same road where she grew up in East Finchley.                                                                                                          , They got a mortgage through a company called Generation Home.

"It's the same road I grew up on and it means my son gets to go to the same schools I went to.                                                                         , "We're all thrilled, although we're currently in conveyancing hell," she says.

The ongoing supply chain disruption has caused the main chemicals in fertilizer — nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash — to rise since spring of 2021.                                                                                                           , "This is a moment for patience as the storm swirls," Larry Oldham, soil specialist with the Mississippi State University Extension Service, said in a report from the extension service.                                                                                                                                                                                        , HARVARD ECONOMIST ON HOW LONG PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO SOAR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Growers trying to make crop decisions for the 2022 season can take steps to limit their costs, Oldham said in the report. Farmers should be efficient with fertilizer application by doing careful soil testing, which can help determine fertilizer needs and avoid overapplication. Applying at the best time and in the best way for highest efficiency is also key, he said., Hays said the high prices will lead to farmers buying less fertilizer, which likely means a smaller harvest. He believes prices could return to normal sometime around June, while the MSU study says it could go until next winter.                                                                                                                                            , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The last time fertilizer prices shot up was between 2007 and 2008.

Shares of retailers have been under pressure for the past several years, while those of online sites have, until recently, been soaring.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Kohl’s is already under pressure to improve its share price. The activist firm Macellum Advisors, which has a 5 percent stake in Kohl’s, urged the retailer in a letter last Tuesday to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale. That was after it raised similar criticisms over Kohl’s stock performance last year. The hedge fund Engine Capital has also been calling on Kohl’s to consider a sale, along with other strategic initiatives.                                                                                                                       , The quick procession of Macellum’s letter and the consortium’s offer may be the beginning of a dance to put pressure on Kohl’s to consider a sale — or otherwise quickly boost its share price. In response to Macellum’s letter, Kohl’s said this past week that it was confident in its board and would “aggressively pursue the best interests of all shareholders.”                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The private equity firm Sycamore Partners has also reached out to Kohl’s about a potential deal, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, as well as a second person close to the matter. The firm is known for its acquisitions of retailers, including Staples and Belk Department Store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Kohl’s, based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., and founded in 1962, is a department store focused on casual wear, home wares and sporting goods. Unlike other retailers like Nordstrom, Kohl’s stores are frequently found in smaller shopping centers, rather than malls. That has made its real estate more valuable as malls have fallen on hard times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A key question will be whether the Starboard consortium will secure the necessary funds to finance the bid, particularly given challenges posed by past leveraged buyouts of retailers, like Toys “R” Us, Payless and Neiman Marcus. Those deals saddled the retailers with debt, leaving them unable to make the necessary investments as e-commerce transformed the retail landscape. All three were eventually unable to make their loan payments and filed for bankruptcy. Both Neiman Marcus and Payless emerged from bankruptcy, while Toys “R” Us ultimately liquidated., Shares of Kohl’s have risen less than 4 percent over the past year, giving it a market capitalization of around $6.5 billion. The offer, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, would value the retailer at $64 a share, 37 percent premium to its closing price of $46.84 on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Acacia Research Corporation, which is leading the bid, has been backed by Starboard since 2019. Starboard has helped Acacia raise a “significant” amount of equity capital to fund its offer, one of the people familiar with the discussions said. Acacia has also received a letter of confidence from a bank, this person said, stating that the bank believes it can help assemble part of the debt necessary for the transaction. Acacia is also in talks with a real estate firm that would sell off part of Kohl’s real estate to help fund the bid, this person said.  , All people who spoke about the matter requested anonymity because the offer is confidential. A spokeswoman for Kohl’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The pandemic sparked the problem. The highly intricate and interconnected global supply chain is in upheaval. Much of the crisis can be traced to the outbreak of Covid-19, which triggered an economic slowdown, mass layoffs and a halt to production. Here’s what happened next:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A reduction in shipping. With fewer goods being made and fewer people with paychecks to spend at the start of the pandemic, manufacturers and shipping companies assumed that demand would drop sharply. But that proved to be a mistake, as demand for some items would surge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Demand for protective gear spiked. In early 2020, the entire planet suddenly needed surgical masks and gowns. Most of these goods were made in China. As Chinese factories ramped up production, cargo vessels began delivering gear around the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Then, a shipping container shortage. Shipping containers piled up in many parts of the world after they were emptied. The result was a shortage of containers in the one country that needed them the most: China, where factories would begin pumping out goods in record volumes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Demand for durable goods increased. The pandemic shifted Americans’ spending from eating out and attending events to office furniture, electronics and kitchen appliances – mostly purchased online. The spending was also encouraged by government stimulus programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Strained supply chains. Factory goods swiftly overwhelmed U.S. ports. Swelling orders further outstripped the availability of shipping containers, and the cost of shipping a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles skyrocketed tenfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Labor shortages. Businesses across the economy, meanwhile, struggled to hire workers, including the truck drivers needed to haul cargo to warehouses. Even as employers resorted to lifting wages, labor shortages persisted, worsening the scarcity of goods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Component shortages. Shortages of one thing turned into shortages of others. A dearth of computer chips, for example, forced major automakers to slash production, while even delaying the manufacture of medical devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , A lasting problem. Businesses and consumers reacted to shortages by ordering earlier and extra, especially ahead of the holidays, but that has placed more strain on the system. These issues are a key factor in rising inflation and are likely to last for months — if not longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Even with financing uncertainty, the offer could put pressure on Kohl’s since Macellum has threatened to nominate directors to Kohl’s board “if the status quo persists.” Macellum criticized Kohl’s in its letter for “mismanaging the business and failing to implement necessary operational, financial and strategic improvements.” It is pressuring Kohl’s to consider carving out its e-commerce business.                                                                                                                                                               , Macellum struck a settlement with the retailer last April that included the addition of three new directors to its board. Shares in Kohl’s have fallen more than 20 percent since then, as supply chain challenges have snarled the industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “We have continued to engage with Macellum since the settlement and are disappointed with the path they have taken and the unfounded speculation in their announcement and letter,” Kohl’s said in response to Macellum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Kohl’s has argued that its efforts to invest in its online and active wear business are underway — and getting traction. In November, it reported that its third-quarter sales had jumped 16 percent. In December 2020, it announced a partnership with Sephora to help draw more shoppers to its stores. Its active wear business, which it is working to make more inclusive to all sizes, now makes up a little more than a quarter of its sales.                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

The officials increasingly cite high inflation in places including the euro area, where prices are climbing at the fastest pace on record, as a sign that the world is experiencing a shared moment of price pain, deflecting the blame away from U.S. policy., But a chorus of economists point to government policies as a big part of the reason U.S. inflation is at a 40-year high. While they agree that prices are rising as a result of shutdowns and supply chain woes, they say that America’s decision to flood the economy with stimulus money helped to send consumer spending into overdrive, exacerbating those global trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The world’s trade machine is producing, shipping and delivering more goods to American consumers than it ever has, as people flush with cash buy couches, cars and home office equipment, but supply chains just haven’t been able to keep up with that supercharged demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Kristin J. Forbes, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, said that “more than half of the increase, at least, is due to global factors.” But “there is also a domestic demand component that is important,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The White House has tried to address inflation by boosting supply — announcing measures to unclog ports and trying to ramp up domestic manufacturing, all of which take time. But rising inflation has already imperiled Mr. Biden’s ability to pass a sprawling social policy and climate bill over fears that more spending could add to inflation. Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat whose vote is critical to getting the legislation passed, has cited rising prices as one reason he won’t support the bill.                                                                                         , The demand side of today’s price increases may prove easier for policymakers to address. The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates to make borrowing more expensive, slowing spending down, in a recipe that could help to tame inflation. Fading government help for households may also naturally bring down demand and soften price pressures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Inflation has accelerated sharply in the United States, with the Consumer Price Index climbing by 7 percent in the year through December, its fastest pace since 1982. But in recent months, it has also moved up sharply across many countries, a fact administration officials have emphasized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “The inflation has everything to do with the supply chain,” President Biden said during a news conference on Wednesday. “While there are differences country by country, this is a global phenomenon and driven by these global issues,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said after the latest inflation data were released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , It is the case that supply disruptions are leading to higher inflation in many places, including in large developing economies like India and Brazil and in developed ones like the euro area. Data released in the United Kingdom and in Canada on Wednesday showed prices accelerating at their fastest rate in 30 years in both countries. Inflation in the eurozone, which is measured differently from how the U.S. calculates it, climbed to an annual rate of 5 percent in December, according to an initial estimate by the European Union statistics office.                                                        , “The U.S. is hardly an island amidst this storm of supply disruptions and rising demand, especially for goods and commodities,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But some economists point out that even as inflation proves pervasive around the globe, it has been more pronounced in America than elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “The United States has had much more inflation than almost any other advanced economy in the world,” said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and former Obama administration economic adviser, who used comparable methodologies to look across areas and concluded that U.S. price increases have been consistently faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The difference, he said, comes because “the United States’ stimulus is in a category of its own.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , White House officials have argued that differences in “core” inflation — which excludes food and fuel — have been small between the United States and other major economies over the past six months. And the gaps all but disappear if you strip out car prices, which are up sharply and have a bigger impact in the United States, where consumers buy more automobiles. (Mr. Furman argued that people who didn’t buy cars would have spent their money on something else and that simply eliminating them from the U.S. consumption basket is not fair.)                                                                , Administration officials have also noted that the United States has seen a robust rebound in economic growth. The International Monetary Fund said in October that it expected U.S. output to climb by 6 percent in 2021 and 5.2 percent in 2022, compared with 5 percent growth last year in the euro area and 4.3 percent growth projected for this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “To the extent that we got more heat, we got a lot more growth for it,” said Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , While many nations spent heavily to protect their economies from coronavirus fallout — in some places enough to push up demand, and potentially inflation — the United States approved about $5 trillion in spending in 2020 and 2021. That outstripped the response in other major economies as a share of the nation’s output, according to data compiled by the International Monetary Fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Many economists supported protecting workers and businesses early in the pandemic, but some took issue with the size of the $1.9 trillion package last March under the Biden administration. They argued that sending households another round of stimulus, including $1,400 checks, further fueled demand when the economy was already healing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Consumer spending seemed to react: Retail sales, for instance, jumped after the checks went out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the U.S. government spent too much in too short a time in the first half of 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “If there had not been the bottlenecks and labor market shortages, it might not have mattered as much. But it did,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Americans found themselves with a lot of money in the bank, and as they spent that money on goods, demand collided with a global supply chain that was too fragile to catch up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Virus outbreaks shut down factories, ports faced backlogs and a dearth of truckers roiled transit routes. Americans still managed to buy more goods than ever before in 2021, and foreign factories sent a record sum of products to U.S. shops and doorsteps. But all that shopping wasn’t enough to satisfy consumer demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The Port of Los Angeles is a window into the mismatch. The port had its busiest calendar year on record last year, processing 16 percent more containers than in 2020. Even so, it still has a huge backlog of ships waiting to dock, several of which, as of Friday, have been waiting a month or more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The extra help the government provided to families last year mattered to inflation because of those bottlenecks, economists said. Giving households more money to buy camping equipment or a new kitchen table widened the gap between what consumers wanted and what companies could actually supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , As goods came into short supply and began to cost more to transport, businesses raised their prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Government checks haven’t been alone in driving strong U.S. demand. As virus fears prevent consumers from planning a trip to Paris or a fancy restaurant dinner, many have turned to refurbishing the living room instead, making goods an unusually hot commodity. Lockdowns that forced families to abruptly stop spending at the start of the pandemic helped to swell savings stockpiles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , And the Federal Reserve’s interest rates are at rock bottom, which has bolstered demand for big purchases made on credit, from houses and cars to business investments like machinery and computers. Families have been taking on more housing and auto debt, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows, helping to pump up those sectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , But if stimulus-driven demand is fueling inflation, the diagnosis could come with a silver lining. It may be easier to temper consumer spending than to rapidly reorient tangled supply lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , People may naturally begin to buy less as government help fades. Spending could shift away from goods and back toward services if the pandemic abates. And the Fed’s policies work on demand — not supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Advertisement </td>

In that time, some people have started new jobs, Zoomed their days away and then left companies where they never even met their co-workers in person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , But one aspect of work remains remarkably unchanged: the importance of the traditional, single-page résumé created in a word processor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Hiring managers and recruiters still rely on the résumé,” said Vicki Salemi, an expert on the job-search process at Monster, the online job-posting site. The résumé, Ms. Salemi continued, is still “the standard to apply for a job and get noticed.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In Monster’s recent “Future of Work” report, recruiters in the United States ranked résumé search — the ability to look through uploaded résumés on sites such as Monster or Indeed — as the most effective tool for finding candidates. The report also found that for employers, a résumé was second only to an in-person interview in determining whether a candidate was a good fit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Résumé design and formats are relatively static, too. A job seeker might find herself using the same format to apply for a type of job that didn’t even exist when she first created a document with her name and address at the top and work history in bullet points below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , That’s because while the basics of the résumé itself haven’t changed, the audience has. In the era of databases and applicant-tracking technology, software systems sort through job candidates before they make their way to recruiters. So it’s important to make sure that a résumé can easily be understood by both humans and technology, said Kathryn Minshew, founder and chief executive officer of The Muse, a website that offers job listings and career coaching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , And machine and human readers alike struggle with overly stylized fonts, such as Comic Sans. Tried-and-true classics like Times New Roman, Arial, Helvetica, Calibri and Georgia are still among the best font options for your résumé, Ms. Minshew said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “In many more traditional fields like banking and finance, STEM, academia, a traditional résumé is still very important, but the look and feel carries less weight,” Ms. Minshew said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Ms. Salemi said that it was crucial for job seekers to highlight and quantify their skills and experience and to make sure they were using the right keywords. These strategies help ensure that their résumé shows up when recruiters search a job site or internal database for specific terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Unlike those seeking jobs in the days of faxed and mailed résumés, today’s job candidates might apply for one position through a company’s job portal, have their résumés uploaded and stored in a database, and then be matched with a different role at the same company months or years later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “If companies are experiencing labor shortages in different areas, they may very well go back to their database,” Ms. Salemi said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , That is why keywords matter. Ms. Minshew counsels people to look closely at the job description and highlight keywords and skills the company is looking for in that role. “Make sure that, if it’s relevant and applicable, you’re highlighting similar skills or even some of the same keywords on your résumé,” Ms. Minshew said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Ms. Minshew noted that a 2019 report from Jobscan found that nearly 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies used an applicant tracking system, which could put job seekers who don’t include the right terms in their résumé at a disadvantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Part of why the résumé has stayed constant while work itself has transformed is that no one method has come along to take over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “The traditional résumé is in the process of being disrupted, but I don’t think it’s necessarily clear yet what the outcome will be,” Ms. Minshew said — adding that it might be replaced by several products instead of a single one. Part of the reason straying from traditional formatting is risky is a résumé could be discarded by the software screening if it can’t process a candidate’s experience correctly. “This is a classic situation of, most people want something different,” she said — but no one has yet had the power to really change things. Though she did say that a number of recruiters — humans not robots — primarily consider a candidate’s LinkedIn profile, rather than a résumé, which is why she encourages people to keep both up-to-date., But just because the format of the résumé hasn’t changed much, it doesn’t mean job seekers shouldn’t try to make theirs look great, especially in creative fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Marcos Chin, an illustrator and professor at the School of Visual Arts, said design professionals are often held to a different standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “My résumé would have to look nice in the sense that it would need to be visually appealing,” he said. “So typography would be considered.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Chin also helps his students — many of whom are just starting out in their careers — polish their résumés, giving them feedback about font sizes and spacing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “A really important thing is the way in which information is organized, so that it can be presented in a way that looks beautiful and makes the person who receives it want to sort of dive deeper into what it is that you do,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Design professionals often have the additional burden of creating a portfolio or personal website that showcases their work.

Other suitors may emerge too. But Kohl's shares closed at $46.84 Friday, so the bid represents a 37% premium.                                                                                                                               , Menomonee Falls, Wis.-based Kohl's has been under pressure to boost its share price, which rose early last year but is little changed from roughly two decades ago. Two activist shareholders -- Macellum Advisors GP LLC and Engine Capital LP -- have recently called on the company to explore selling itself.                                                                     , Customers leave the Kohl's store in Westminster, Colorado                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Kohl's said earlier this week that its strategy is producing results and that its board "regularly works with specialized advisers to evaluate paths that have the potential to create long-term value." It said it plans to unveil its strategic plans at an investor day in March.                                                                                                  , Little-known Acacia has a market value of just $215 million, but the consortium told Kohl's it received what is known as a "highly confident" letter from a bank asserting that it will be able to attain a debt-financing package for a portion of the bid, the people said. While such letters are no guarantee, they can be a meaningful vote of confidence.                       , AMAZON PLANS A CLOTHING STORE FOR A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MALL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Other details of the consortium's proposal -- and who is in the group -- couldn't be determined. Reuters reported earlier this week that Acacia was exploring a possible bid for Kohl's.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Should it succeed, the group could aim to sell the company's real estate to another party, which could make pulling off the transaction easier. Activists have proposed that Kohl's explore sale-leasebacks of its real estate, which they have estimated could be worth $7 billion or more.                                                                                          , RETAIL EXPERT WARNS RISE IN CRIME COULD 'CATALYZE THE NEXT RECESSION'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Macellum said in an open letter to Kohl's shareholders Tuesday it has been pushing the company to add additional directors with retail experience or to hire bankers to explore a sale.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Before Starboard invested in the firm and joined its board in 2019, Acacia was primarily a holding company for patents.

The CEO explained that for a long time the company has wanted to pay their employees more in-line with other professions that require long bouts away from home, and recent economic conditions have provided that opportunity.                                                                       , JOBLESS CLAIMS UNEXPECTEDLY RISE TO 286,000, HIGHEST SINCE OCTOBER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Richards says that over-the-road trucking is "one of the toughest occupations in the country from a standpoint of just the conditions that you deal with along with being away from your family and away from home, so it's a difficult job." He compared it to offshore oil field workers who make a lot of money, but the trade-off is living away from home for a period of time., KLLM was able to provide the pay boost, Richards says, because it has been able to charge more to "shippers at levels we've never seen before," and the company wants to pass that along to its drivers. The CEO says KLLM is catching up now after "a long time that we've not been able to pay drivers what they're worth."                                                       , Blue Bell Ice Cream is seen on shelves of a grocery store (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The trucking company has been in business for 55 years and hauls products for Fortune 500 companies such as Mars, Kraft, General Foods, ConAgra and Hershey, along with Richards' favorite, Blue Bell Creameries. </td>

That element is the Federal Reserve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , As the worst economic ravages of the pandemic appear to be waning, at least for now, the Fed is ushering in a return to higher interest rates. It is also beginning to withdraw some of the other forms of support that have kept stocks flying since it intervened to save desperately wounded financial markets back in early 2020.                                                                                                                                                                       , This could be a good thing if it beats back inflation without derailing the economic recovery. But removing this support also inevitably cools the markets as investors move money around, searching for assets that perform better when interest rates are high.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “The Fed’s policies basically got the current bull market started,” said Edward Yardeni, an independent Wall Street economist. “I don’t think they are going to end it all now, but the environment is changing and the Fed is responsible for a lot of this.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The central bank is tightening monetary policy partly because it has worked. It helped stimulate economic growth by holding short-term interest rates near zero and pumping trillions of dollars into the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , This flood of easy money also contributed to the rapid rise in prices of commodities, like food and energy, and financial assets, like stocks, bonds, homes and even cryptocurrency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , What happens next comes from an established playbook. As William McChesney Martin, a former Fed chairman, said in 1955, the central bank finds itself acting as the adult in the room, “who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The mood of the markets shifted on Jan. 5, Mr. Yardeni said, when Fed officials released the minutes of their December policymaking meeting, revealing that they were on the verge of embracing a much tighter monetary policy. A week later, new data showed inflation climbing to its highest level in 40 years.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Putting the two together, it seemed, the Fed would have no choice but to react to curb rapidly rising prices. Stocks began a disorderly decline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Financial markets now expect the Fed to raise its key interest rate at least three times this year and to start to shrink its balance sheet as soon as this spring. It has reduced the level of its bond buying already. Fed policymakers will meet next week to decide on their next steps, and market strategists will be watching.                                                                                                                                                                       , Low interest rates made certain sectors especially appealing, foremost among them tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 information technology sector, which includes Apple and Microsoft, has risen 54 percent on an annualized basis since the market’s pandemic-induced trough in March 2020. One reason for this is that low interest rates amplify the value of the expected future returns of growth-oriented companies like these. If rates rise, this calculus can change abruptly.                              , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                    , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The very prospect of higher interest rates has made technology the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Since its peak in late December, it has fallen more than 11 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The S&amp;P’s three best-performing sectors in the early days of 2022, on the other hand, are energy, financial services and consumer staples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The energy index is dominated by fossil fuel companies, like Exxon Mobil and Halliburton, whose fortunes have risen along with oil and gas prices. Financial companies can charge more for loans when interest rates are high. Big banks like Wells Fargo have reported bumper earnings over the past week. Consumer companies like Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup lagged the explosive share price growth of tech stocks earlier in the pandemic, but they have been gaining ground in this new environment., The stock market, overall, has also lost some of its buoyancy for reasons other than monetary policy. “Stay at home” stocks that flourished during pandemic restrictions, like Netflix and Peloton, have begun to flag as people venture out more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Some astute market analysts foresee bigger problems. Jeremy Grantham, one of the founders of GMO, an asset manager, predicts a catastrophic end to what he calls a “superbubble.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But the current losses could be beneficial if they let a little air out of a potential bubble, without bursting investor portfolios. This year’s declines erase only a small share of the market’s gains in recent years: The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 27 percent last year, more than 16 percent in 2020 and nearly 29 percent in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                         , And the prospects for corporate earnings remain good. Once the Fed starts to act, and the effects are better understood, the stock market party could continue — at a less giddy pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures jumped towards $4 per million British thermal units after hitting an over two-week low of $3.78 on January 20th, underpinned by expectations of record demand and tight supplies. Weather forecasts showed colder temperatures for the fortnight ahead, which is expected to cause domestic inventories to stand below the 5-year average for the first time since mid-December, as utilities draw larger-than-normal amounts of gas from storage. Meanwhile, a cold snap in Texas and other producing states has frozen wells and other equipment, curtailing output levels to their lowest in four months. Production in the lower 48 states averaged 95.3 bcfd so far this month, down from a record 97.6 bcfd in December. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazil's 10-year government bond yield traded around 11% in January, easing from near a 7-week high of 11.595% hit on January January 18th, tracking a fall in global yields on falling risk sentiment. Domestically, President Bolsonaro is expected to sign the 2022 budget, which would remove a point of uncertainty. Still, Brazil's economic outlook remains clouded by high inflation and the prospect of rising rates, elevated unemployment, as well as fiscal and political concerns ahead of presidential elections in October. While neither candidate has formally declared his candidacy, former President Lula is leading the pools, and despite he suggesting he could name Geraldo Alckimin as a running mate if he is elected a worsening in Brazil’s budget deficit is on the radar. </td>

       slumped 2.3% toward an eight-month low in morning trading Friday, and have tumbled 26.5% amid a six-day losing streak, enough for formerly bearish BofA Securities analyst Geoff Meacham to say investors should stop selling the biotechnology company. Meacham raised his rating to neutral from underperform, and lifted his stock price target to $180 from $135. Meacham said he has been bearish on Moderna for some time because of "overly optimistic" Wall Street assumptions on COVID-19 boosters, but has valuation has compressed in recent months and as the pandemic starts moving toward endemic status, he is now focusing more on the beyond-"Spikevax" pipeline. "Bulls previously called Moderna the 'Tesla of Biotech,' which meant that the stock narrative overruled valuation assumptions but now, the latter looks more reasonable," Meacham wrote in a note to clients. "As a results, we think the risk/reward in [Moderna] shares is more favorable, considering Moderna's leadership position in mRNA technology."

Its symptoms present in a spate of two-week notices. Its transmission is visible in real time. And few bosses seem to know how to inoculate their staff against this quitagion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , It catches quickly. “There’s a shock when you see multiple people leaving — it’s like, oh, is there something I’m not seeing?” said Tiff Cheng, 27, who left her job in digital marketing in July, along with five of her close friends at the 40-person agency. “Is it my time to leave as well?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Quitting rates were high in August, September and October. Then, according to Labor Department data, they climbed even further: More than 4.5 million people left their jobs voluntarily in November, a record high in two decades of tracking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Economists explained the numbers by noting that competition for workers led to better pay and benefits, driving some to seek out new opportunities. Psychologists have an additional explanation: Quitting is contagious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , When workers weigh whether to jump jobs, they don’t just assess their own pay, benefits and career development. They look around and take note of how friends feel about the team culture. When one employee leaves, the departure signals to others that it might be time to take stock of their options, what researchers call “turnover contagion.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , So quitting begets more quitting, a challenge that employers can’t always solve with raises or perks. Even a single resignation notice can breed a “hot spot,” said Will Felps, who teaches management at the University of New South Wales and was an author of a study of turnover contagion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr. Felps and his team studied staffing at a hospitality company and a selection of bank branches, all in the United States, and found that one worker’s decision to leave is especially likely to inspire others who don’t feel strongly embedded at the company. In a recent poll of more than 21,000 LinkedIn members, 59 percent said a colleague’s departure had led them to consider quitting as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The office has long been a petri dish for infectious behavior. Lying, cheating and job satisfaction all tend to spread from desk to desk. Financial advisers, for example, are 37 percent more likely to commit misconduct if they encounter teammates who have done so, what researchers refer to as “peer effects,” noting that one case of misconduct results on average in an additional 0.59 cases. Employees also mimic the nutritional patterns of people they sit with in the cafeteria. Teammates are suggestible to one another in far subtler ways than they realize.                                                             , But when it comes to heading for the exit, peer effects are particularly potent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “When you walk by a restaurant and it’s full of people, it’s a clue this restaurant is pretty good,” Mr. Felps said. “Similarly, when the people you know, like and respect are leaving a job, you think maybe the grass is greener somewhere else.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Here are more fascinating tales you can’t help but read all the way to the end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Ms. Cheng saw her inbox begin to fill with resignation notes last summer. Every other week she got an email from a colleague who was quitting her company, where hours were long and career advancement options seemed limited. She decided to turn full time to her own coaching business, which she now runs from Vancouver, British Columbia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “It’s always really scary to make a decision to leave your job, and it was nice to be able to see other people were doing it,” Ms. Cheng said. “It didn’t feel as lonely, or like I was an outsider.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A sense of workplace disaffection and restlessness started growing for many Americans in the early stages of the pandemic. For some, social media became a therapy couch, a space to vent those employment frustrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Back in March 2020, Erika Cruz, 31, was working at a Silicon Valley start-up, where she had grown disgruntled with the hallmarks of work life: “meetings that could have been an email” and lack of control over her schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , She got the motivation she needed to leave that summer when she watched a friend she had met on Instagram ditch a cushy tech job to open a coaching firm. Then Ms. Cruz, who had about six months of living expenses saved up, moved back to her parents’ home in the Bay Area and put in her one month’s notice at work. She sought advice from social media about how to start a business. Ms. Cruz realized, though, that there was no one-size-fits-all approach to upending a career.                                                                                                                                                   , “If you Google banana breads, there’s over a million recipes online, and they’re all going to be good but they’re all slightly different,” she said. “You have to choose your own recipe.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , It’s the story of the pandemic: When people posted their banana bread photos, they influenced their friends to start baking as well. But like quitting, it was something no two people did the same way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The friend who inspired Ms. Cruz’s resignation, Cat Del Carmen, 34, agreed that it was important to develop her own quitting strategy. Ms. Del Carmen was able to leave a job at Adobe by cutting back spending on restaurant meals, vacations and TJ Maxx splurges. The six months after she left her job were high pressure financially. Ms. Del Carmen drew comfort from her correspondence with friends on social media who were also navigating the post-paycheck territory.                                                                                                                                                            , That bond forged by resignation, as people look to one another for inspiration and affirmation, is a phenomenon that predates the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “It’s a huge decision,” said Anthony Klotz, an organizational psychologist at Texas A&amp;M University. “If you Google how to resign from your job, there’s lots of conflicting guidance. Those answers are not in a company handbook. It makes sense people reach out for sounding boards from trusted others.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Aimee Wells, 53, who works in public relations, had her own quitagion experience years ago. She had been working at a global marketing firm in San Francisco, where she bristled at the time constraints of corporate life. She was never able to drop off her son at kindergarten. She remembered watching the 1996 movie “One Fine Day,” in which Michelle Pfeiffer plays an architect who decides to make her family a priority over high-powered work. It left Ms. Wells grappling with how to reset the balance between her own corporate job and personal life (far as it was from the realities of Ms. Pfeiffer and George Clooney’s)., One evening, on the train coming home from work at 6, she ran into a neighbor carrying shopping bags full of files, office supplies and photographs. The neighbor told Ms. Wells that she had just quit the role that was burning her out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “I went home and started thinking about it a lot more seriously,” Ms. Wells said. One month later, she put in her own resignation notice, catalyzed by the run-in with her neighbor. “She was like my hero.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The payoffs for some pandemic quitters have been significant. Nikissa Granados, 26, was weighing whether to leave her job at an Orange County, Calif., school in 2020 to do freelance social media marketing. She made the leap after seeing two of her teammates resign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Ms. Granados went from making $2,100 a month, spending days on her feet setting up cots for nap time and begging children to wear their masks, to making as much as $8,000 monthly while dictating her own schedule, she said. She realized something now viscerally clear to many child care providers: In her work at the school, the mismatch between strain and pay had been stark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , For employers, replacing just one quitter is a straightforward task. But replacing several, or even dozens, is far more challenging, and the interim period tends to leave existing staff with a heavier load, while recruiters field awkward questions about what’s fueling all the departures. With quitting rates soaring, some executives are wondering how to lift morale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Seth Besmertnik, chief executive of the marketing software company Conductor, had seen his company’s turnover rates hover in the low single digits for years. He even worried that his retention was too strong, making it hard to scout new talent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Over the last two years, though, turnover rose into the double digits. Mr. Besmertnik had to get creative in his tactics to keep workers content, including adding new holidays and bringing Broadway actors from “Hamilton” and “Dear Evan Hansen” to sing “Burn” and “Waving Through a Window” (respectively) for staff during all-company video meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Career coaches, meanwhile, worry that some people are being too easily influenced by the behaviors of their roaming colleagues. Kathryn Minshew, chief executive of the Muse, a job search site, warns clients that a single employee’s desire to leave a company shouldn’t have too much bearing on the decisions that friends make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “When one person announces their resignation, there are usually some questions from their colleagues and workplace friends,” she said. “‘Where are you going?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Producer prices in Slovenia jumped 10.6 percent year-on-year in December of 2021, quickening from a 9.9 percent rise in the previous month. It was the highest producer price inflation since records began, mainly driven by prices in manufacturing industries (10.9 percent vs 10.2 percent in November), mining &amp; quarrying (7.1 percent vs 6.7 percent), and to a lesser extent, water supply (4.8 percent vs 3.0 percent). In contrast, inflation remained steady for prices of utilities (2.7 percent). On a monthly basis, producer prices rose by 0.6 percent, easing from a 0.9 percent rise in November. On a yearly basis, producer inflation climbed to 5.5 percent, compared with 5.1 percent in 2020. </td>

Weather forecasts showed colder temperatures for the fortnight ahead, which is expected to cause domestic inventories to stand below the 5-year average for the first time since mid-December, as utilities draw larger-than-normal amounts of gas from storage. Meanwhile, a cold snap in Texas and other producing states has frozen wells and other equipment, curtailing output levels to their lowest in four months.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stocks opened mostly lower Friday, on track for a hefty weekly loss as the Nasdaq Composite pushes deeper into correction territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
        DJIA,
        -1.30%
       rose 56 points, or 0.2%, to 34,772, while the S&amp;P 500

At rival JPMorgan, the bonus pool for that category rose 30% to 40%, other people with knowledge said, confirming a Bloomberg report.                                                                                                                          , "I know bankers who are exceptionally happy, they generally did the best this year as opposed to traders," said David McCormack, head of finance recruitment firm DMC Partners. "This is the highest compensation many people have seen in the last decade."                                                                                                                                  , Pay is up everywhere you look on Wall Street, from first-year bankers to partners and top executives, after a two-year boom in mergers and markets activity sparked by the Federal Reserve's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Wage inflation was a key theme this past week as banks disclosed fourth-quarter results, with analysts fretting that rising expenses will eat into profits., The rise in bank's bonus pools tracks their results for 2021. For instance, at Goldman, investment banking revenue jumped 58% from the previous year to $14.9 billion on high levels of completed mergers and initial public offerings. JPMorgan said last week that its 2021 investment banking fees climbed 39% to $13.2 billion.                                                           , The rise in compensation pools doesn't tell the full story. Managers use the pools to dole out bonuses to individual employees, and their incentives are determined by how much they contributed to team results. Rainmakers who source and close billion-dollar deals are paid the most.                                                                                                     , Goldman partners in areas that did particularly well like technology and health-care investment banking made between $12 million and $15 million last year, McCormack said. Senior partners running divisions made even more, he said.                                                                                                                                                        , Top-performing managing directors, who are one level down from partners, brought in $5 million to $7 million, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , And the Goldman figures don't include special one-time awards for partners which can amount to multimillion-dollar sweeteners, according to the people familiar with the situation. The bonuses were dubbed PPA, or Partnership Performance Awards, by the bank, according to a source.                                                                                                       , "We wanted to remind partners how valuable they are and express how exceptional this year was," one person said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , At Goldman, the rise in banker pay mirrored the advance in overall compensation for the firm's 43,900 workers. Pay and benefits expenses jumped 33% to $17.7 billion, which amounts to $403,621 per person, compared with $329,000 in 2020.                                                                                                                                                   , At JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, compensation costs rose 13% to $13.1 billion, or $193,882 for each of the division's 67,546 workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "There's a lot more compensation for top bankers and traders and managers who I should say did an extraordinary job in the last couple years," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said last week in a conference call.  "We will be competitive in pay. If that squeezes margins a little bit for shareholders, so be it."                                                                              , Wage inflation reached all corners of the investment bank. Dimon himself earned a 10% raise to $34.5 million last year, the bank said Thursday in a filing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Pressure to retain workers amid fierce competition for talent even filtered down to recent college graduates. JPMorgan recently boosted base salaries for first-year investment banking analysts to $110,000, matching the rate that Goldman set last year, according to sources who confirmed a Financial News report.                                                                       , But for every banker who is celebrating a windfall, there are many others who are or will be deeply disappointed after learning their number. Michael Sloyer, a former Goldman trader who is now a leadership development coach, shared his own realizations about the intensity of banking culture.                                                                                          , "At times, the money became a proxy for my value as a person," said Sloyer, who spent 11 years climbing the ranks at Goldman, ultimately reaching managing director. "As the number grew larger over the years, the comparisons only grew to the people around me. It could feel like a never-ending treadmill."                                                                              , Read more: Wage inflation has arrived in a big way and Jamie Dimon says CEOs ‘shouldn’t be crybabies about it’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Dow Jones was shifting between gains and losses after opening slightly higher, and the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq remained into negative territory on Friday amid disappointing earnings results and as investors anticipate a tighter monetary policy. Netflix was the main drag falling 22% after the company's subscriber outlook missed estimates due to the rise in streaming competition. Focus now turns to the Fed monetary policy decision next week and further earnings reports from big tech companies which investors fear could disappoint. The Nasdaq is on track for its worst week since October 2020 and both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are likely to book a 3rd straight week of losses. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lithium carbonate prices in China rose to 348,500 yuan/tonne in the second half of January, amid high global demand and difficulty of securing supplies. Prices have surged over 25% this year from continuously increasing demand from lithium battery manufacturers, especially for electric vehicles. Global electric vehicle sales are estimated to have increased by 160% during 2021, while deliveries in China are expected to double in 2022 to over 5 million sales. Meanwhile, battery manufacturers race to secure long-term supply contracts due to mineral scarcity and environmental concerns with mining. On January 20th, the Serbian government revoked mining giant Rio Tinto’s exploration licenses following extensive protests of environmental concerns. The now-defunct project would have been worth USD 2.4 billion and was estimated to produce enough lithium for 1 million electric vehicle batteries. </td>

Considering November, retail sales increased 0.7 percent over a month earlier, easing from a downwardly revised 1.5 percent in October and missing preliminary estimates of a 1.2 percent increase. Sales rose in 6 out of 11 sub-sectors, with overall growth driven by increased retail in gasoline stations (4.9 percent), building material, garden equipment and supplies (3 percent), and food and beverage stores (1 percent). Across major Canadian provinces, gains took place Quebec (1.2 percent), Ontario (0.5 percent), and British Columbia (0.8 percent), despite intense flooding during November. On an annual basis, retail trade hiked 4.4 percent in November, easing from an upwardly revised 5.5 percent in October. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Heating Oil Futures Ease from 7-Year High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Heating oil futures moderated to $2.6 per gallon after touching an over seven-year high of $2.73 on January 19th amid a broad pullback in futures of crude and oil derivatives, as traders monitored changes in domestic inventories. Oil inventory stocks unexpectedly rose in the second week of the month, after being on a downward trend for seven weeks, while heating oil inventories increased for the first time in four weeks. Still, storage levels remained near their lowest since 2014 following a freezing start of the year in the US Northeast, which provided upward momentum. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK 10Y Bond Yield Eases from Near 3-Year High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the UK 10-year government bond fell back below 1.2%, as tensions between the US and Russia and a fall in equity markets boosted demand for safe-haven assets. Washington said it was prepared to impose significant sanctions on Moscow if it invades Ukraine, while Russia said there are currently no plans to launch an attack while making several demands to the West, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. The UK yield has recently touched a near three-year high of 1.3%, amid prospects of faster monetary policy tightening due to stubbornly high inflation. Data showed Britain's consumer prices rose 5.4% in December, the largest increase since March 1992. The CPI numbers, combined with stronger November activity data and better jobs data, pointed to a possibility of a 25bps rate hike by the Bank of England on February 3rd, which is expected to be followed by multiple rate rises this year. Elsewhere, the US Fed is also seen raising rates in March. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Serbia revokes Rio Tinto lithium mine permits following protests </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Serbia has withdrawn the exploration licences of Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto following weeks of protests over plans for a lithium mine.                                                                                                                                 , "All permits were annulled... we put an end to Rio Tinto in Serbia," Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said on Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                     , The decision comes just weeks ahead of Serbia's general election in April.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Relations between Belgrade and Canberra have also soured recently over Australia's treatment and deportation of Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic.                                                                                                                                   , Djokovic, the world's number one men's tennis player who was unable to compete in the Australian Open, has supported the protests against the controversial mine.                                                                                                                     , In December, he posted images on social media of demonstrators and green landscapes along with comments written in Serbian such as "clean air and water are the keys to health" and "nature is our mother".                                                                           , Thousands of demonstrators have been taking to the streets in recent months, blocking main roads in several cities, including the capital Belgrade and the country's second-largest city Novi Sad.                                                                                    , They say the development of a large mine near the town of Loznica in the western Jadar Valley could cause irreparable damage to the landscape and contaminate the region's water supplies.                                                                                            , Rio Tinto had previously said that any mining development in the country would meet both domestic and European Union environmental standards.                                                                                                                                         , Speaking at a news conference in Belgrade on Thursday, Ms Brnabic - Serbia's first woman and first openly gay prime minister - said the decision to abandon the $2.4bn (£1.8bn; A$3.3bn) Jadar lithium mine was made in response to requests from environmental groups.               , The project had been due to start production in 2027.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Rio Tinto's shares tumbled in Australia following the news, and were down more than 4% after markets opened in London.                                                                                                                                                                , It is undoubtedly tempting to look for a link between Australia's treatment of Novak Djokovic and Serbia's cancellation of Rio Tinto's mining project.                                                                                                                                , After all, it does have headquarters in Melbourne as well as London. And Serbia's prime minister, Ana Brnabic, announced the demise of the much-trumpeted lithium extraction operation just days after her counterpart in Australia cheered the deportation of Serbia's sporting icon., The cancelled project is more likely a victim of Serbia's domestic politics, rather than a bizarre diplomatic tit-for-tat. Novak Djokovic is important to Serbia - but not as important as the $2.4bn which the mining giant had promised to invest.                                  , In fact, pulling the plug is a reaction to months of protests. The movement has surprised Serbia's authorities with its organisation, unity and broad support going well beyond the usual coalition of opposition activists.                                                          , The government does not want to go into April's elections against a backdrop of blocked roads and accusations about favouring foreign investors over local interests.                                                                                                                 , But the environmentalists say they will continue protesting until the authorities issue a permanent ban on lithium mining.                                                                                                                                                            , In December, local authorities in western Serbia scrapped a plan to allocate land for a lithium mine in the region.                                                                                                                                                                   , President Aleksandar Vucic had said that the opening of such a mine would require approval following an environmental study and a referendum.                                                                                                                                         , In a statement to Reuters news agency, the Australian government said it regretted Serbia's decision: "We note the strong economic benefits of the significant investment by Rio Tinto in Serbia," it said.                                                                           , Lithium is the main component of the batteries used in electric vehicles and demand for the element is increasing.                                                                                                                                                                    , The World Bank estimates that globally the production of lithium will need to increase by 500% by 2050.                                                                                                                                                                               , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Can they keep their progress hidden from their loved ones?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The extraordinary rise and fall of underworld boss Paul Massey                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , © 2022 BBC.

This chart is just.. yeah we haven’t been here for a while. 

🤮 

Lost all support on daily, weekly, this bad boy is just getting started for a very, very interesting ride down. 

However, don’t let anyone fool you. They’ve fooled you thinking the market has been in an overall bull run because these big indices were looking so “healthy” - when realistically what happened is never healthy for any time frame. That being said, just because this is going to dump hard, don’t let them fool you into thinking the overall market is dumping as well. The opportunity is now to find great companies with awesome products &amp;amp; balance sheets, great products that are immensely undervalued &amp;amp; pick them up at the bottom. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Market Breadth Shows Stock Sell-Off Not Over And Could Have More Weakness Ahead

By:Ming Jong Tey

Published: Jan 23, 2022, 09:10 CST•
4min read

The current stock market breadth reading is not yet below the capitulation line, which suggests the market sell-off might continue with more weakness ahead.

Despite the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPX) has come down nearly 10% off the peak in this month, with stock market breadth continues the downtrend since May 2021, there is no sign of market bottoming. Having said that, SPX is definitely oversold with climatic down move and wide price spread, which is likely to experience a selling climax soon before an automatic rally kicks in.

If you are placing a directional bet for Friday you are straight gambling.  

Bulls want this back over 200 SMA. Bears want those gaps below to fill.

This chart is just.. yeah we haven’t been here for a while. 

🤮 

Lost all support on daily, weekly, this bad boy is just getting started for a very, very interesting ride down. 

However, don’t let anyone fool you. They’ve fooled you thinking the market has been in an overall bull run because these big indices were looking so “healthy” - when realistically what happened is never healthy for any time frame. That being said, just because this is going to dump hard, don’t let them fool you into thinking the overall market is dumping as well. The opportunity is now to find great companies with awesome products &amp;amp; balance sheets, great products that are immensely undervalued &amp;amp; pick them up at the bottom. </td>

And, trustee, inflation is ON HIS MIND.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $QQQ See a lot of people comparing the bubble now to 2000. Here&amp;#39;s a friendly remind that it&amp;#39;s not even close to being comparable.  
 
Highlighted are the two years leading up to the top of the dot com bubble and the two years leading up to the most recent all time high.  
 
Notice how parabolic the dot com bubble was in comparison to our current trend, which don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, is over extended, but not anything like it was back then. And then not the two year return. While the current two year return was pretty crazy, it&amp;#39;s less than a third of the 2000 bubble&amp;#39;s last two year return. </td>

Trump really was the greatest gift to the Chinese government. 

I mean think about what this one guy did. Single handedly caused friction amongst the European alliance and other US partners. Caused hysteria around vaccines and masks to the point where about 30% of the population is now skeptical of vaccines (not understanding nor realizing the longer term economic or societal complications that will be caused by those ~15% who end up with long covid who may need assistance for life). Sowed doubt in the legitimacy of numerous institutions and the legitimacy of the vote. 

Honestly Trump was the greatest gift to China.I believe 2016 will go down in history as the year that China overtook the United States. I mean US citizens won’t even get a shot to protect their fellow man. They’re gonna beat China (who has basically snuffed out covid at this point) in a war? Not a chance. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Ukraine, the Fed and earnings will set the tone in next week.  

$PSFE Foley will continue to buy more and continue to lower his cost basis. Then in time maybe late in the year, he will sell it to a more successful Fintech a bank or call his buds at Blackstone at buy it outright soon, and take it public at $9B in a few years. Rinse and repeat.  Buy low from retail sell high to retail.

This is going to be a crazy week.  What are you looking at?

$SOFI Chamath is convinced the world is ending and he probably sells any pop.  Unfortunately they own way too much and SoFi price remains at his mercy.  Maybe when he announces that he is all out, it will have a move towards $20.

$AAPL $MSFT are expensive safe havens.  It was not long when Apple traded under $140 &amp;amp; Microsoft at $280. Compared to their growth these two are expensive.  The question is will investors place higher value on safe havens? Yes but best to wait for the October prices. </td>

My thoughts on the week ahead  

One of the biggest mistakes I made back in 2020 was being bearish too long. Many of you who follow me remember me getting well ahead of the mkt crash in 2020. I was warning with multiple posts on ST about a market that was about to crash when the SPY was making all-time highs (SEE BELOW). But I fell into the same trap many will once again fall into this time around. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I feel the mkt has some more pain.  But, I&amp;#39;ve been shorting since the start of the year. And I play the bounces. The trap many will fall into is not realizing how strong short squeeze rallies can be. 

I spent the weekend putting together my Game Plan for the Week. I also wrote a blog titled &amp;quot; How do we know when we are at a bottom&amp;quot; . These are some very volatile times in the mkt but also some of the greatest opportunities. TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, UVXY - where are they headed. If  interested in joining, email me at

Friday, we saw $PTON bounce off of a devastating fall. But, like the last big PTON drop, had a bounce, which then followed by further decline. Let&amp;#39;s see how this one plays out!

Thursday&amp;#39;s report will likely add to this optimism as sales jump to over $118 billion and profits improve to about $1.89 per share from $1.68 per share a year ago. Looking further out, shareholders are just as excited about Apple&amp;#39;s future as it uses assets like its huge cash stockpile to extend its lead into augmented reality, virtual reality, and potentially the automotive industry.

Analysis
Apple earnings preview: Apple (AAPL) reports earnings with expectations that the Cupertino tech giant will report revenue of $118.2B and EPS of $1.88. Morgan Stanley expects Apple to guide for a relatively in-line March quarter on the back of improving iPhone production into year end and modest Services outperformance. Following the recent share price stumble, the firm says it would be buyers on any further weakness following earnings as it views AAPL as a more defensive/quality outperformer in challenging markets. Meanwhile, UBS heads into the Apple print with an expectation for FY22 iPhone units of 230M, which it calls a conservative mark given lingering supply chain headwinds and uncertain carrier promotional activity next fall and winter. </td>

In times of uncertainty, it is critical to understand multiple ways of trading in order to be successful. 

Today we saw $SPY heading towards the open gap at 436.04. Steadily trending down on multiple technicals. Once hit, we will be expecting a reversal shortly after.

2. For the earnings of $MSFT $TSLA $AAPL buy calls and puts for 5% of the price. 

You will make money unless they don’t move 5% up or down either way which is highly unlikely. If you want to play safe instead of 5% do 2%. </td>

Expect to see Giga Berlin beginning production sometime in March of 2022

Once it begins production, we should see the factory ramp up quickly - probably more than the 150,000 yearly run rate that Giga Shanghai did when it first opened.

Expectations are running high ahead of Tesla, Inc.&amp;#39;s (TSLA) earnings next week. The company is on strong footing for its fourth quarter 2021 earnings call on Jan. 26. It weathered the pandemic successfully by pivoting its production capabilities to overcome the automobile industry&amp;#39;s chip shortage. The carmaker also opened two new factories and reported record deliveries for its electric vehicles. To top it all off, Tesla was the best-selling electric vehicle (EV) brand in Europe in 2021.1 Appropriately enough, analysts are predicting a great performance next week. 
 
KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Analysts have issued bullish assessments ahead of Tesla&amp;#39;s earnings next week. 
They say the car company will exceed analyst expectations during its earnings call and have set high price targets for the company based on its future growth trajectory.

Eventually the ones writing these call options are going to figure out it is not worth the risk and stop buying common shares to remain neutral.  This goes for Apple too.  The end is near.  Just like Qualcomm brought down the house in 2000 Apple and Tesla will do the same. </td>

Remember! 

Psychological fear is generally used at War against enemy to break them down its well documented through out History of Wars !! You can literally win a war without any effort just break down your opponents psychologically ! 

These terrorists HFs with their criminal Media are  terrorizing ppl spreading fear to break them down psychologically so they can sell at losses  - they’re at war with American ppl against the United State of America 🇺🇸— your courage and conviction in Tesla ,, America will prevail — follow your intuition not your emotions and you shall emerge victorious!! 

It is my understanding: DOJ , SEC , including WH are responsible to protect the ppl who elected them !! 

Long &amp;amp; Strong —- zero FUCKING fear!!

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA next week will be one of the most volatile this year probably. And we already had insane volatility.
I read and watched everything I could and it is pretty clear that we r dealing with 3 unpredictable developments. They r still unpredictable for all guru-s and experts, so if u don&amp;#39;t read and watch anything, u won&amp;#39;t lose anything

So it is unpredictable:
- how market moves before Fed 
- want Fed says (hawkish surprise or not)
- how mkt reacts to Fed (it is not even clear that mkt dumps if Fed will be hawkish, cuz it is possible that market already prices the hawkishness in until Wed)

So, relax, everyone is in the same boat. 

I think the most logical strategy is to simply treat it as a random casino play. If u like casino, stay in the market. If u don&amp;#39;t like gambling - simply stay away and wait until the dust settles. </td>

The company is on strong footing for its fourth quarter 2021 earnings call on Jan. 26. It weathered the pandemic successfully by pivoting its production capabilities to overcome the automobile industry&amp;#39;s chip shortage. The carmaker also opened two new factories and reported record deliveries for its electric vehicles. To top it all off, Tesla was the best-selling electric vehicle (EV) brand in Europe in 2021.1 Appropriately enough, analysts are predicting a great performance next week. 
 
KEY TAKEAWAYS 
Analysts have issued bullish assessments ahead of Tesla&amp;#39;s earnings next week. 
They say the car company will exceed analyst expectations during its earnings call and have set high price targets for the company based on its future growth trajectory.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA Start with a simple exercise. Try to give a brief as possible description for your stocks and investments, but that captures as much as possible. For Tesla, I get:

An Advanced AI Based Robotics and Clean Energy Company. 

How much do you think such a company is worth in the future (5-10 years, or more). I think several trillion.

I will post more snippets of my analysis and models here from time to time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA a lot of people have their direction for the automotive industry going in the wrong direction. Automakers will have a huge year this year, due to the supply chain issues. Banks will take a beating, as lending rates continue to increase, their portfolios will decrease. We still haven’t felt the impact in the housing industry yet! A lot of automakers have their own financing/banks, and control their own rates. The automakers are where you want to invest. Even if we go into a recession, people still need transportation! </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $ATOM If it is true about $TSLA, and I personally  believe it very well coukd be, you will see recent irrational despair change to irrational exuberance so quick your head will spin. Part of me wonders if that is the root cause of Rich Shannon&amp;#39;s original $150 moonshot comment. Being involved with Tesla certainly could be a driver of such a move.  Whatever he was referencing, it was based on something he had clearly heard and of a highly substantial nature. Wr shall see.... </td>
