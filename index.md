Biden is 100% correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Putin -- whom Biden has rightfully called a "war criminal" -- should not remain in power given his horrific attack on Ukraine, his role in slaughtering civilians in Syria and his efforts to undermine Western democracies, including during the 2016 US presidential campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Biden didn't hold back in what will likely be seen as a historic speech Saturday just hours from the Ukrainian border. The president appealed directly to the Russian people, telling them, "I refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God's sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs."                                                                                                                              , Biden also shared his emotional conversations with Ukrainian refugees earlier that day, recounting how he "saw tears in many of the mothers' eyes as I embraced them; their young children -- their young children not sure whether to smile or cry." And he shared the story of what they said to him such as "one little girl [who] said, 'Mr. President' -- she spoke a little English -- 'is my brother and my daddy -- are they going to be okay? Will I see them again?' "                                                                   , The world has seen the horrors Putin has rained down upon the people of Ukraine simply because they won't bend a knee to this brutal dictator and agree to give up their democracy and self-determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The civilian death toll in Ukraine has exceeded 1,100 people -- including nearly 100 children -- according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, but it notes the actual figures are likely considerably higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Some of the most horrific events include the actions of Putin's forces in the March 16 bombing of Mariupol's Drama Theater -- a shelter for civilians -- killing about 300 people, according to Ukrainian officials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , And as The New York Times documented last week, Russian forces have bombed at least 23 hospitals and other health care infrastructure, 330 schools and 27 cultural buildings as well 900 houses and apartment buildings. The paper also detailed Russian forces have used cluster munitions, which are imprecise and amount to indiscriminate bombings of civilians.                                                                                                                                                                               , Biden has been right to call Putin a "war criminal" and even a "butcher," as he stated Saturday after visiting Ukrainian refugees in Poland. No one who engages in an unprovoked attack on another nation and then in war crimes should remain in power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But Putin, the "murderous dictator," as Biden has also described him, engaged in these types of gruesome attacks on civilians in Syria as well, beginning in 2015 when his forces provided military support to keep Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in power. Putin's forces in Syria -- as in Ukraine now -- bombed hospitals, schools, markets and other civilian targets. Putin's military devastated Syrian cities and in the process slaughtered more than 24,000 civilians, as The Guardian detailed, citing civilian casualty monitor Airwars., Beyond those apparent war crimes, Putin has been actively working to undermine Western democracies. For example, in France's 2017 presidential election campaign, Russian operatives reportedly spread disinformation in an effort to hurt the candidate they opposed, the moderate Emmanuel Macron, while boosting the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen.                                                                                                                                                                                        , And of course, in the United States, as the Mueller report documented, "The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion." The report further noted "a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton," explaining "the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome."                                              , Biden on Saturday reiterated a point he has made time and time again since becoming President, namely the world is locked in a contest between democracy and autocracy. During his inaugural address on January 20, 2021 -- just two weeks after the January 6 attack on the Capitol -- he declared, "We have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile."                                                                                                                                                                     , It's why just a month later during his virtual speech at the Munich Security Conference, Biden said, "Democracy doesn't happen by accident. We have to defend it, fight for it, strengthen it, renew it." It also explains why in December his administration organized the Summit for Democracy, which brought together democratic leaders from around the world to tackle the threat of autocratic forces such as Putin.                                                                                                                         , Near the end of his speech Saturday, Biden returned to this theme as he explained the world is caught in "a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , In keeping with that point, he slammed Putin's ambitions, declaring "a dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty." Instead, Biden promised "a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , That is when Biden said about Putin, "For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , All I can say in response is: Amen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent Drops as Shanghai Locks Down </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures fell more than 3% toward $116 per barrel on Monday, erasing a 1.4% gain in the previous session, in anticipation of a drop of fuel demand in China after authorities in Shanghai said they would shut the country’s financial hub to carry out Covid-19 testing over a nine-day period. Shanghai’s city government said Sunday public transport, including ride-hailing services, will be suspended during the lockdown, adding that unapproved vehicles will not be allowed on the roads. It also said that all companies and factories will suspend manufacturing or have people work remotely. The moves followed an 11.8% jump in oil prices last week as markets grappled with supply disruptions caused by sanctions against Russian energy, damage to a major pipeline in the Black Sea and militant attacks on Saudi oil facilities. Meanwhile, investors also weighed failure within the EU to ban Russian oil imports on opposition from Germany and others reliant on energy exports from the country. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Qatar Trade Surplus Widens Sharply in February </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The trade surplus in Qatar surged to QAR 22.4 billion in February of 2022 from QAR 13.2 billion in the same period of last year, amid solid global demand and rising commodity prices. Exports soared 54.6 percent to QAR 31.9 billion, due to higher sales of petroleum gases &amp; other gaseous hydrocarbons (41.7%), crude petroleum oils &amp; oils obtained from bituminous minerals, etc. (120.3%), and non-crude petroleum oils &amp; oils obtained from bituminous minerals, etc (127.4%). Among major key partners, exports increased to China (118.8%), South Korea (1.7%), Japan (46.6%). Meanwhile, imports grew at a much softer 28.1 percent to QAR 9.6 billion, with purchases increasing for turbojets, turbo propellers &amp; other gas turbines; parts thereof 50.2%) and motor cars &amp; other motor vehicles for the transport of persons (47.9%). Imports were up from China (37.2%), the US (13.9%), India (46.4%), and Oman (249.7%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Japan 10 Year Government Bond Yield increased to a 6-year high of 0.244%, as the benchmark of 10-year US Treasury yield hovered near its highest since May 2019, amid signs of faster and bigger rate increases by the Federal Reserve this year following stubbornly high inflation in the world's largest economy. On the price front, Japan's annual inflation rate accelerated to 0.9% in February, the most since April 2019; while core consumer prices were up 0.6%, the 6th consecutive month of rises and the most in 2 years, amid widening divergence between the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The Governor of the Bank of Japan, Kuroda said that must maintain ultra-loose monetary policy as recent cost-push inflation could hurt the economy. The central bank last month defended its key bond yield target by offering to buy unlimited amount of 10-year bond at 0.25%. </td>

They are also increasing standing charges to the maximum level for each region, which means a big jump for some places. , The average increase - of just under 20p per day - will add more than £71 a year to a standard electricity tariff. But in North Wales and Merseyside, the South West, the Midlands, South Scotland and South Wales the rise will add over £80 a year. In London less than £30 will be added.                                                            , Price per day for Single Rate Electricity Meter from April 2022 by British region in order of percentage charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Source: Ofgem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The changes are slightly different for customers using prepayment meters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , It comes as households in England, Scotland and Wales prepare for an even bigger hit when the energy price cap - which limits what consumer pay per unit of gas and electricity - also goes up in April.                                                                                                                                                , In Liverpool, David and Joan Boyle told us their energy bill was rising by £700.

He was enjoying a day out in the sunshine with his son Leo. He told us they'd "normally shop around every year when bills come in, but at the moment it's pointless".                                                                                              , He added: "We're managing alright with things but we're conscious of having the heating and things like that on.

It is also the part of your bill that will contribute to the cost of the 28 energy suppliers that have gone bust since last autumn amid a cost crunch sparked by sharply rising wholesale energy prices.                        , Ofgem told the BBC that the levy added to bills to pay for costs associated with energy suppliers going bust had been spread equally across the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                , It says standing charges in some regions are increasing more than others because of a reallocation of network costs, the level of which differs between distribution networks.                                                                                                                                                                          , The BBC contacted major suppliers British Gas, Scottish Power, EDF, EOn, Ovo/SSE, Shell, Octopus and Bulb, and almost all confirmed they now have a majority of customers on a standard default tariff, which is controlled by the Ofgem cap.                                                                                                           , Three of the biggest suppliers, British Gas, Scottish and Ovo/SSE would not give details on their charges, calling them "commercially sensitive".                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But EOn, EDF, Shell, Octopus and Bulb confirmed they were increasing standing charges on these tariffs in line with the standard charge cap, with example prices (including VAT) from Bulb, EDF and Shell varying from 32p a day in London and 38p in the East, to around 50p in Northern Scotland and the South West.                                  , And it is not an expense that can be avoided by shopping around. While tariffs actively chosen by customers, such as fixed rate tariffs, are not subject to the default tariff cap on standard charges, there are only a handful of such deals on the market.                                                                                           , Moneysupermarket told the BBC that as of 14 March, there were just five fixed tariffs available to consumers. This compares to about 96 fixed deals available at the same time in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                 , Standing charges are certainly not the biggest part of your energy bill, and they are dwarfed by the massive increases in the unit price for the energy you use.                                                                                                                                                                                        , But in normal circumstances an extra £80 a year on your energy bill just from standing charges would not go unnoticed, especially as in some areas they are increasing by a lot more than others. So is something fishy going on?                                                                                                                       , Ofgem assures me that the extra costs for failed energy companies are being spread equally across the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But the Energy Networks Association say that no major network developments have happened in any areas in the last six months that would explain the regional divisions.                                                                                                                                                                                 , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Incredible technology takes you on an emotional journey deep inside!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stock futures edge lower ahead of a big week of economic data </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Stock futures were slightly lower Sunday evening as investors look ahead to a series of key economic reports and continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve's planned interest rate hikes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved lower by 58 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures each fell 0.1%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The Dow and S&amp;P rose in the previous session to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.                                                                                                                                                        , The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia's war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed's plans to hike interest rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "It seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. "Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won't be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.", The bull case on Apple that could take it 70% higher from here, according to Evercore ISI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A rebound in small caps could spark even more gains for the S&amp;P 500, chart analyst says                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Forget Tesla — this auto stock is the one to buy right now, analyst says                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank's chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                        , On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.                                                                                                                                      , Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Two of P&amp;O Ferries' competitors are set to meet officials from the Department for Transport to discuss the fallout from P&amp;O's decision to sack 800 staff.                                                                        , Bosses from DFDS and Stena Lines have been invited for talks on Monday as the government plans to force ferries to pay the minimum wage in UK waters.                                                                            , P&amp;O Ferries prompted outrage when it replaced staff with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage.                                                                                                                         , The prime minister has backed calls for the boss of P&amp;O Ferries to resign.                                                                                                                                                       , Last week, P&amp;O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that the decision to sack 800 workers without notice broke the law.                                                                                              , On Saturday, protests took place at several ports, with unions holding demonstrations at Dover, Hull and Liverpool.                                                                                                              , Authorities have detained P&amp;O Ferries' European Causeway in Northern Ireland, saying the vessel was "unfit to sail".                                                                                                             , The ship was held in Larne over "failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training", the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said. P&amp;O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service. , Unions have raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, after P&amp;O replaced their members with agency workers whose average hourly rate of pay would be £5.50 - less than the UK minimum wage.                              , As the company's ships operate internationally and are registered overseas, the UK minimum hourly rate of £8.91 does not apply.                                                                                                  , P&amp;O Ferries has said it had to replace crews as it was losing £100m a year, and would not be a viable business without making the changes.                                                                                       , However, this week Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to propose measures which will force ferry companies to pay UK minimum wage when a ship is in UK waters.                                                         , There has also been concern over the possible disruption to Easter holiday travel plans if P&amp;O ships are unable to sail.                                                                                                         , A Department for Transport spokesperson said: "Ministers are working to understand how we can ensure the continuation of services in collaboration with other operators, including DFDS and Stena."                              , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                                       , Incredible technology takes you on an emotional journey deep inside!                                                                                                                                                             , Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle                                                                                                                                                                              , © 2022 BBC.

He was 103.                                                                                                                                                                                 , His death was confirmed by his daughter Deborah Pope, who did not specify a cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , OLEDs are thin organic materials sandwiched between two electrodes that illuminate when tweaked with an electrical current. Highly energy efficient and often wafer thin, OLEDs are the technology of choice in high-end cellphone displays and televisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Dr. Pope (who changed his last name from Poppick to avoid anti-Jewish prejudice) made a series of discoveries that laid the basis for the field of molecular semiconductors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , He based his experimental studies on organic compounds called anthracene and tetracene. It was a serendipitous choice: Dr. Pope found that these compounds contained the necessary ingredients for the creation of carbon-based electronic devices that paralleled the operation of silicon. But unlike silicon, which comes from minerals, carbon-based materials with semiconductor properties can be soft and pliable, making them easier to shape into thin films used in electronic devices., In the early 1960s, Dr. Pope published one of his most important papers, “Electroluminescence in Organic Crystals,” which reported that electricity could be used to generate light from anthracene. “That was a milestone that has found root in the high-performance displays we’re seeing today,” said Richard Friend, a physicist at the University of Cambridge.                                                                                                                            , Dr. Pope’s insight into some of the strange quantum mechanical phenomena shown by tetracene also turned out to be well ahead of its time. In a paper published in 1969, he demonstrated the possibility of producing two excited molecules, or excitons, in a tetracene crystal after just one photon of light was absorbed in it.                                                                                                                                                               , The result, Dr. Pope said in a 2011 interview for this obituary, was a scientific two-for-one. “Since two excitons are created by a process that usually creates one, the efficiency of converting light into useful electric current is greatly increased,” he said. The practical application of the discovery is growing apparent as it offers a way to improve the efficiency of solar cells.                                                                                                , “If you go through the scientific literature, too often stuff is plain wrong,” said Professor Friend. “Martin managed to get a whole range of things absolutely right so early, and I marvel at that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Having laid the scientific foundations for the field, Dr. Pope wrote, with Charles E. Swenberg, the definitive text “Electronic Processes in Organic Crystals and Polymers.” First published in 1982, the book of more than 1,300 pages remains the principal reference in the field of organic semiconductors.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Dr. Pope, who focused on basic research, held few patents and did not seek to profit from his discoveries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In 2006, the Royal Society awarded Dr. Pope the Davy Medal, given annually to a scientist whose research helped bring about extraordinary advances in any field of chemistry. Several people who have built on Dr. Pope’s work have won Nobel Prizes. In 2000, the prize in chemistry was awarded jointly to Alan J. Heeger, Alan G. MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa for inventing a technique for making plastic conduct electricity.                                                           , “In a sense, Martin Pope’s work was a prelude to all that,” Sir John Meurig Thomas, an emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of Cambridge, said in an interview in 2011. (He died in 2020.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Martin Pope was born Isidore Poppick on Aug. 22, 1918, in a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His parents, Phillip and Anna, were both Jewish immigrants who had come to New York from Poland as teenagers. His father worked as a laborer in a fur shop, stretching animal skins.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “We were completely dependent on whether times were good enough for people to buy fur coats,” Dr. Pope said in the 2011 interview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , In 1938, as an undergraduate at the City College of New York studying physical chemistry, the 20-year-old Isidore Poppick published a research paper in the prestigious Journal of the American Chemical Society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , After serving as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Forces in World War II, he sought employment. Aware of an undercurrent of antisemitism, Dr. Pope applied in 1946 for a position at the American Cyanamid Company using two names: Isidore Poppick, with the published paper listed on his résumé, and Martin Pope, with no such record.                                                                                                                                                      , “Martin Pope received an application, and Isidore Poppick received a notice that no positions were available,” Dr. Pope said. “I decided to use Martin Pope as my new name.” One of Dr. Pope’s brothers also changed his name to Pope when he encountered similar prejudice while looking for work.                                                                                                                                                                                              , In 1946, Dr. Pope took a position as a research scientist at Balco Research Laboratories, a small industrial research laboratory in Newark. Also that year, he married Lillie Bellin, a high-school teacher; they remained married until her death in 2015.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Dr. Pope returned to Balco after a break for graduate studies at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, where he received his Ph.D. in 1951.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But, unhappy with the commercial sector’s emphasis on patents, Dr. Pope left Balco in 1956 and took a post as a research scientist in the physics department at New York University, where he began to experiment with inorganic and organic insulators that could be used to store data. He remained at N.Y.U. for the duration of his career.                                                                                                                                                  , Besides his daughter Deborah, Dr. Pope is survived by another daughter, Miriam Pope; a brother, Michael; and four grandchildren.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Dr. Pope was known among his colleagues and friends as someone who shunned self-promotion. “He was a scientist’s scientist, and by that I mean he never sought great publicity,” said Roald Hoffmann, a theoretical chemist at Cornell who was a winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981.  “He just kept on working and producing good work.”                                                                                                                                             , In the 2011 interview, Dr. Pope said he was surprised by the practical application of his discovery. “At the time I carried out my research,” he said, “I did not have the faintest idea that it would become of worldwide importance.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Shanghai has said it will lock down each half of the city by turns for mass Covid-19 testing starting Monday amid surging infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The eastern half of the city -- comprising around 11 million residents -- will go into lockdown at the start of the week for four days, while the 14 million remaining people will start lockdown from Friday, the Shanghai government said on Sunday night.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Everyone is required to participate in the citywide Covid-19 screening to maintain a "green" health code status that would allow them to access grocery stores and public areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , During their respective lockdowns, people will be banned from going out, and all non-essential workers must work from home. Public transport including buses, subways, ferries, and taxis in lockdown areas will also be suspended.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Shanghai registered 2,678 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday alone, accounting for nearly half of all new cases recorded in China that day, according to the country's National Health Commission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , China's inability to bring its latest outbreak under control so far has prompted online rumblings from frustrated citizens, as questions about Beijing's zero-Covid strategy break into the mainstream for the first time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In Shanghai -- a city with some of the best infrastructure in the country -- social media complaints suggest that systems intended to ensure residents have what they need are failing, as lockdowns are extended without notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "How can I buy groceries? ...

In a bid to relieve the pressure on hospitals. several indoor stadiums and exhibition centers in the city have been converted into centralized quarantine facilities for Covid-19 patients who are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms., Despite sealing off more residential compounds after Covid-19 cases were detected, Shanghai was reluctant to implement a citywide lockdown before the Sunday announcement. "If Shanghai came to a complete halt, there would be many international cargo ships floating in the East China Sea," said Wu Fan, a medical expert with the city's pandemic task force on Saturday.                                                                , China is still reluctant to impose full, citywide lockdowns despite rising case numbers -- the highest since the pandemic started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Prince William says he respects any country's decision to become a republic  - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Britain's Prince William says he's not in the business of "telling people what to do" and any future relationship between countries in the Caribbean and the UK is "for the people to decide."                                                                                                                                                                                           , The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have spent the last week traveling through three Commonwealth realms -- Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas -- on a trip aimed at celebrating Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne.                                                                                                                                                                          , His unprecedented remarks came at the conclusion of a tour that has been plagued by negative headlines and sparked questions over the continued role of the monarchy in the region.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Last November, Barbados severed its last remaining colonial ties to London, removing the Queen as head of state and inaugurating its first president, Sandra Mason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In a statement issued by Kensington Palace on Saturday, the duke said overseas tours were "an opportunity to reflect."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "You learn so much. What is on the minds of Prime Ministers. The hopes and ambitions of school children. The day-to-day challenges faced by families and communities," he explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , However, in a candid admission, William continued: "I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future. In Belize, Jamaica and The Bahamas, that future is for the people to decide upon. But we have thoroughly enjoyed spending time with communities in all three countries, understanding more about the issues that matter most to them."  , William reiterated his commitment to service, along with his wife Catherine's, before adding: "For us that's not telling people what to do. It is about serving and supporting them in whatever way they think best, by using the platform we are lucky to have."                                                                                                                              , The second-in-line to the British throne said royal tours reaffirmed their desire "to serve the people of the Commonwealth and to listen to communities around the world." He then signaled he wouldn't mind if in the future someone outside of the royal family took on leadership of the Commonwealth, the 54-member group of mostly former British territories.                            , "Who the Commonwealth chooses to lead its family in the future isn't what is on my mind. What matters to us is the potential the Commonwealth family has to create a better future for the people who form it, and our commitment to serve and support as best we can."                                                                                                                        , William and Kate's first official visit to the region was beset by issues. The couple were told by Jamaica's prime minister on Wednesday that the country was "moving on" and will attain its "true ambition" to be "independent."                                                                                                                                                             , A day before, a group of anti-monarchy protesters had gathered in front of the British High Commission to demand an apology from the visiting royals over Britain's role in the transatlantic slave trade.                                                                                                                                                                                     , Earlier in the trip in Belize, a royal engagement was also canceled amid reported opposition from local residents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Sign up to CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls. </td>

"Moreover, 32% of all consumers expected their overall financial position to worsen in the year ahead, the highest recorded level since the surveys started in the mid-1940s." , Curtin assessed that the combination of rising prices and less positive income expectations meant that half of all households anticipated declines in inflation-adjusted incomes in the year ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The only area of the economy that consumers remained optimistic over was the job market, with 30% of respondents anticipating in March that during the year ahead it was more likely that the unemployment rate would post further declines compared to the 24% of respondents who anticipated increases.                                                                                                                                                                                    , "Strong job growth will continue to put upward pressures on wages, resulting in higher income and stronger job prospects," Curtin said. "This strength will then act to expand consumer demand and ultimately lead to another cycle of price and wage increases. These factors represent the necessary (but not sufficient) conditions for the development of inflationary psychology as a self-fulfilling prophecy."                                                                        , He further assessed that "the prevention of inflationary psychology is much less costly before it becomes ingrained in the economic behavior of consumers and firms." While confidence that economic policies will resolve the problem is essential, Curtin noted unfortunately, half of all consumers unfavorably assessed current policies, more than three times the 16% who rated them favorably.                                                                                        , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , According to Investopedia, many consumers worried that the Federal Reserve failed to adequately act on chances to nip inflation in the bud at its earlier stages. The MCSI assessed in mid-January that respondents’ confidence in government policies declined to its lowest level since 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                              , The MCSI end of March findings rated the current economic conditions at 67.2%, representing a 1.5% decline from the 68.2% in February and a 27.7% decline since a year ago in March 2021. The index of consumer expectations was at 54.3% by the end of March, down by 8.6% from February’s 59.4% and a decrease of 31.9% from a year ago in March 2021. </td>

Their armored groups have struggled against Western-supplied anti-tank weapons and Turkish-made drones. Ukrainian air defenses have punched above their weight and are now being reinforced by thousands of US-made Stinger missiles.                                                                                                                                                     , Poor logistical support, questionable tactics and growing evidence of poor morale among Russian battalion tactical groups have allowed the Ukrainian military to hold off Russian advances in several regions -- and begin to take the fight to the enemy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , CNN analysis of satellite imagery, social media content and official statements from both sides suggests the conflict may now be moving into a new phase: a war of attrition in which the Russians may lose more ground than they gain and suffer even greater resupply issues as the Ukrainians cut into their extended lines.                                                                                                                                                , There are indications that the Russian military is trying to compensate for this by greater use of missile forces and indirect fire from artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. To the north and west of Kyiv, for example, the Russians appear to be digging in rather than seeking to advance, shelling areas like Irpin and Makariv, where Ukrainian troops have established a tenuous hold.                                                                         , In the last two weeks, there's been an uptick in Russian missile strikes, from Lviv in the west to Zhytomyr in central Ukraine and Mykolaiv in the south, with prime targets being fuel dumps, military depots and airfields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ukraine goes on the attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The Ukrainians have been mostly circumspect about going on the offensive, but on Friday National Security Adviser Oleksiy Danilov said: "We are going on the counterattack in some areas, and this counterattack is absolutely productive."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , These fightbacks are limited and focused but include fronts in the south, central Ukraine and the northeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The Institute for the Study of War, in its latest assessment, describes them as "prudent and effective, allowing Ukrainian forces to regain small areas of tactically or operationally significant terrain without overextending themselves."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The south                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The push towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson is perhaps the most ambitious. After resisting attempts by Russian forces to take Mykolaiv -- a bridgehead for assaulting Odesa -- the Ukrainians launched devastating missile attacks against the Russian command at Kherson's airport (killing a Russian general in the process, they say) and gained ground to the north of the city. This as civil disobedience in the city has frayed the nerves of Russian troops. , On Sunday, a large crowd took to the streets of Kakhovka -- east of Kherson -- to protest Russian occupation. A local journalist, Oleh Baturin, told CNN that Russian forces still controlled the area. Kakhovka matters because it's close to a bridge linking Kherson with points east. A Russian land corridor linking Crimea with its border would be hard to sustain without that access.                                                                                 , Baturin said there was heavy fighting near the nearby town of Tavriysk and Nova Kakhovka, where there was a large concentration of Russian forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , How this battle evolves could have a major bearing on the Russian campaign in the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The northeast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Perhaps surprisingly, Ukrainian units have also gained territory close to the Russian border, around the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. Kharkiv, just 30 miles from the Russian border, has been under almost constant attack since the first day of the invasion but remains in Ukrainian hands.                                                                                                                                                                                 , Ukrainian forces now appear to have retaken some outlying areas. Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, claimed Saturday that "several settlements were liberated" east of the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , A long video analyzed by CNN showed an assault by troops of the ultra-nationalist Azov Battalion on a village near Kharkiv in which they took a number of Russian prisoners, some of them apparently badly wounded. Other videos showed a string of villages south of Kharkiv now in Ukrainian hands.                                                                                                                                                                          , Russian forces continue a weeks-long attempt to take Izium, to the south of Kharkiv, but Ukrainian resistance continues in the heavily damaged city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , A local official, Maksym Strelnyk, said Sunday that "currently, the situation in Izium is extremely complicated.

If sustained, these gains could complicate an already long Russian supply chain and even cut off forward Russian units.                                                                                                                                                                        , It's not all one-way traffic. The city of Chernihiv north of Kyiv is still surrounded by Russian forces, which have also entered the nearby city of Slavutych this weekend. Social media videos showed them in control of the center of the city, using stun grenades and bursts of automatic fire into the air as a crowd of several hundred Ukrainian civilians protested.                                                                                                   , And the Russians retain the ability to shell the outskirts of Kyiv from the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Moscow's shifting language                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , As their ground campaign falters, Russian officials have asserted that encircling Ukrainian cities actually serves an ulterior goal: to pin down Ukrainian forces and prevent them from focusing on the separatist regions of Donbas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia's General Staff, said Friday that laying siege to Ukrainian cities and damaging military infrastructure "allow us not only to tie down their forces and prevent them from strengthening their grouping in the Donbas."                                                                                                                                                                                            , In announcing the special military operation on February 24, President Vladimir Putin said it was aimed at securing Donbas -- the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk -- from an alleged Ukrainian assault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Rudskoy appeared to reference that, saying, "In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed." The Russian intention was never to storm Ukrainian cities, he insisted, adding that while the possibility was not excluded "our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing -- the complete liberation of Donbas."                                                                                                               , But Rudskoy also referred to a more ambitious goal of Putin, the so-called "demilitarization and denazification" of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The available evidence suggests Russian forces are edging forward on the fringes of Donbas. But a significant component of those forces has been itself tied down in the grueling siege of Mariupol. Losses there will affect their ability to project force elsewhere in the southeast.                                                                                                                                                                                       , The Institute for the Study of War said Rudskoy's comments "could indicate that Russia has scaled back its aims and would now be satisfied with controlling the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but that reading is likely inaccurate."                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The ISW says: "The absence of significant Russian offensive operations throughout most of Ukraine likely reflects the inability of the Russian military to generate sufficient combat power to attack rather than any decision in Moscow to change Russia's war aims or concentrate on the east."                                                                                                                                                                              , The Ukrainian armed forces command appears unconvinced too, saying that Russian units are reorganizing and consolidating to replace combat losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , All of which suggests a second and possibly still bloodier phase of the conflict is about to begin, as Russia tries to reinvigorate a faltering campaign on the ground while doubling down on its use of cruise and ballistic missiles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , CNN's Eliza Mackintosh, Julia Presniakova and Nathan Hodge contributed to this report. </td>

Putin of Russia said last week that he would require “unfriendly countries” to pay for Russian gas in rubles. The move was intended to force countries like the United States and Britain to prop up Russia’s currency, which crashed after sanctions targeting Russia’s central bank effectively froze hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. People, in turn, rushed to exchange their rubles for dollars or euros. Officials in Europe and experts in the United States have already rejected the idea of paying in rubles. In another attempt to mitigate economic ruin, the Russian stock market reopened for limited trading on Thursday after a monthlong shutdown. The MOEX index rose 4.4 percent, but this upward trend was probably because of government measures aimed at avoiding a sell-off.                                                                                                           , The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, foreshadowed the central bank’s more aggressive approach to inflation, speaking urgently last week about the Fed’s willingness to take additional measures to ease demand and curb record inflation. His comments followed the Fed’s decision to increase its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, the first of several increases the Fed is now projecting for 2022. “If we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” Mr. Powell said last Monday. In Britain, where inflation is at a three-decade high, officials announced measures on Wednesday to help people cope with the rising prices, including plans to cut taxes on gasoline and diesel and release more funds to support low-income households.                                            , The Biden administration made two moves to roll back tariffs imposed by President Donald J. Trump that sought to limit trade with Britain and China. On Tuesday, the administration announced an end to Trump-era tariffs on British steel and aluminum. In return, Britain agreed to lift tariffs on a variety of American products including whiskey and blue jeans. The agreement removed some of the remaining trans-Atlantic trade tensions, which bubbled up under Mr. Trump. The next day, the Office of the United States Trade Representative said it would allow some Chinese products to bypass tariffs imposed during a trade war between Mr. Trump and Beijing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a comment period for a far-reaching rule that would require public companies to report their impact on the environment to shareholders and the federal government. The public can respond for 30 days after the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register or until May 20, whichever comes first. The rule is intended to inform shareholders about the risks that climate change may pose to a company’s bottom line, including whether consumers may lose interest in products or services that contribute to global warming. Advocates for the measure say it will hold companies accountable for how they affect the climate and give investors more leverage to nudge businesses toward more environmentally friendly practices. But the proposed rule is already facing opposition from some business trade groups and the prospect of potential court challenges.             , Union drives continue to sweep Starbucks locations across the country, with employees in Seattle, the franchise’s hometown, and Mesa, Ariz., voting last week to unionize. The stores are the seventh and eighth locations to vote for unions. Since December, more than 100 Starbucks stores have filed for union elections. Amazon has been trying to fend off unions in two of its own elections: Employees in Staten Island were still casting their ballots, and voting ended on Friday in Bessemer, Ala. A union victory in either location would be a first for Amazon’s operations in the United States. There is special attention on Bessemer, where the union lost an election last year and Amazon was hit with complaints from the National Labor Relations Board for its activities during the union efforts. This time, Amazon has relied largely on mandatory meetings intended to discourage workers from supporting the union., Last month’s jobs report showed a strong gain, with U.S. employers adding 678,000 jobs in February. The March report is also expected to be strong — though how strong will depend on the elasticity of demand, which has to do with whether factors like changing prices affect consumer behavior. The March report from the Department of Labor will not have registered any effects of the Fed’s rate increase, which was announced midway through the month. But the central bank’s moves will be a big caveat going forward as a potential recession looms large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes and spooking investors. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices, and could severely affect various countries and industries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion.  Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Financial turmoil.

In a surprise move, he declined to renew his contract as host of “Fox News Sunday” and jumped to archrival CNN. His daily interview show — “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” — starts Tuesday on the new CNN+ streaming service.                                                                                                                                                                                              , So why did Mr. Wallace change the channel?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion,” Mr. Wallace said in his first extensive interview about his decision to leave. “But when people start to question the truth — Who won the 2020 election? Was Jan. 6 an insurrection? — I found that unsustainable.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “I spent a lot of 2021 looking to see if there was a different place for me to do my job,” he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The anchor was eager to describe what attracted him to his new gig: excitement about CNN+, the more freewheeling format of streaming TV — “I don’t have to say, you know, ‘Wolf Blitzer starts right now at 6:59:59’” — and the opportunity to expand beyond politics. In early episodes, he discusses space travel with the “Star Trek” actor William Shatner, asks the former Disney boss Bob Iger about meeting the pope, and at one point sings a warbling duet with the songstress Judy Collins., But Mr. Wallace also acknowledged that he felt a shift at Fox News in the months after Donald J. Trump’s defeat in 2020 — a period when the channel ended its 7 p.m. newscast, fired the political editor who helped project a Trump loss in Arizona on election night and promoted hosts like Mr. Carlson who downplayed the Jan. 6 riot.                                                                                                                                                           , He confirmed reports that he was so alarmed by Mr. Carlson’s documentary “Patriot Purge” — which falsely suggested the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was a “false flag” operation intended to demonize conservatives — that he complained directly to Fox News management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Mr. Wallace said of his time at the network. “And since November of 2020, that just became unsustainable, increasingly unsustainable as time went on.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Still, he acknowledged that some viewers may wonder why he did not leave earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “Some people might have drawn the line earlier, or at a different point,” he said, adding: “I think Fox has changed over the course of the last year and a half. But I can certainly understand where somebody would say, ‘Gee, you were a slow learner, Chris.’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Fox News declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Wallace said his new CNN+ series, which airs at 6 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, was inspired by the work of famed interviewers like Larry King and Charlie Rose. (His father, the “60 Minutes” legend Mike Wallace, hosted a versatile interview program of his own in the late 1950s, with guests ranging from Henry Kissinger to the actress Jean Seberg.)                                                                                                                                   , The set of the show is sparse, just Mr. Wallace and a guest sitting on either side of a Plexiglas table — a more brightly lit version of Mr. Rose’s long-running PBS format. Mr. Wallace said he hoped “to have the kind of intimate, thoughtful conversation where we forget we’re on camera in a studio.”                                                                                                                                                                                          , Marketing materials for CNN+ prominently feature Mr. Wallace alongside younger hosts like the former NPR host Audie Cornish, the chef Alison Roman and the actress Eva Longoria. The advanced ages of some of his early guests — Ms. Collins is 82, and Mr. Shatner just turned 91 — also suggest that Mr. Wallace’s program might complement more millennial-focused fare.                                                                                                                          , The service, which costs $6 a month, debuts on Tuesday, years after the arrival of streaming competitors like Fox Nation and the CBS News Streaming Network. CNN executives view it as a major effort to gain a foothold with viewers who are abandoning cable subscriptions in favor of online alternatives for news.                                                                                                                                                                               , The stakes are high for CNN, which is undergoing wrenching change. The channel’s parent company, WarnerMedia, is expected to be acquired by Discovery Inc. in the next few weeks. A new president, Chris Licht, is taking over CNN after the network’s longtime leader, Jeff Zucker, resigned in February over an undisclosed relationship with a colleague.                                                                                                                                         , Mr. Wallace allowed that he was “obviously unhappy” that Mr. Zucker, the man who hired him, was forced out in a corporate scandal just weeks after he joined up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “It’s not ideal,” he said of Mr. Zucker’s exit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Mr. Wallace is best known for his political expertise — he moderated two presidential debates, served as NBC’s chief White House correspondent and is an equal-opportunity griller of Democrats and Republicans — but he now plans to graze on other topics, including sports and the arts. Interviewing Ms. Collins, he chimes in with a few lyrics from her 1975 hit, “Send In the Clowns.”                                                                                                        , “I wanted to get out of politics,” Mr. Wallace said, adding, “Doing a Sunday show on the incremental change from week to week in the Build Back Better plan began to lose its attraction.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , He demurred when asked about recent opinions expressed by Mr. Carlson and other Fox News commentators about Russia and Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “One of the reasons that I left Fox was because I wanted to put all of that behind me,” Mr. Wallace said, adding that since his exit, “there has not been a moment when I have second-guessed myself about that decision.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Britain will reveal crypto regulation plans in coming weeks, sources say </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , LONDON — The U.K. government will soon reveal plans to regulate the cryptocurrency market, focusing on a fast-growing type of token known as stablecoins, according to four industry sources familiar with the matter.                                                                            , British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to make an announcement in the coming weeks about a new regulatory regime for crypto, the sources told CNBC, preferring to remain anonymous as the information hasn't yet been made public.                                                      , The Treasury declined to comment when asked about the plans by CNBC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Details of the plans are still being finalized, however sources who spoke to CNBC say they are likely to be favorable to the industry, providing legal clarity for a sector that has so far been mostly lacking in regulation.                                                                    , According to the sources, Treasury officials have shown a willingness to understand the complexities of the crypto market and so-called stablecoins, digital assets that derive their value from existing currencies like the U.S. dollar.                                                        , The department has been in discussions with a number of firms and trade groups. That includes the Winklevoss brothers' crypto exchange Gemini, one of the sources said. Gemini issues its own stablecoin called the Gemini dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.                            , Five months in, bitcoin ETFs are down big but showing signs of staying power                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Jim Chanos reveals new short position in crypto exchange Coinbase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Jeffrey Gundlach says he would buy bitcoin over gold in the short term                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Stablecoins have seen exponential growth in terms of usage over the past few years, in tandem with rising interest in cryptocurrencies more broadly. Tether, the world's largest stablecoin, now has a total circulating supply of more than $80 billion — up from about $4 billion two years ago., But those tokens have also caused concern for regulators, who worry they may not be fully backed by an equivalent amount of reserves, and are being used for money laundering and other illicit activities.                                                                                       , Meanwhile, regulators are worried about possible exposure of the financial system to bitcoin and other digital currencies, as well as their potential use for evading sanctions imposed on Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.                                                                   , The Bank of England on Thursday called for policymakers to expand regulatory frameworks to limit the risks posed by crypto to financial stability.                                                                                                                                                , BOE Deputy Governor Sam Woods wrote a letter to several bank CEOs saying there has been "increased interest" from banks and investment firms in "entering various crypto markets."                                                                                                                , The Treasury's move is being viewed as a response to President Joe Biden's executive order calling for coordination from different U.S. federal agencies on regulating crypto, the sources said. Several industry insiders have bemoaned the lack of similar action from the U.K.                 , A number of companies, including Revolut, Blockchain.com and Copper could be forced to wind down their crypto operations in the U.K. this week if they fail to make it onto the Financial Conduct Authority's cryptoasset register in time for a Mar. 31 deadline.                                , The FCA said a "high number" of crypto businesses aren't meeting the required anti-money laundering standards. Just 33 companies have made it onto the register. More than 80% firms assessed by the regulator have either withdrawn their applications or been rejected.                         , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada says it can provide more oil, gas and uranium to help solve the global energy crisis.                                                                                                                                                               , Prices have soared as a result of Russian supplies being squeezed because of its invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                      , Canada's natural resources minister said many countries are committed "to help as much as we can in terms of displacing Russian oil and gas".                                                                                                              , The world's fourth biggest oil producer has committed to exporting an extra 200,000 barrels of oil.                                                                                                                                                        , Its Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told BBC News it would also export an additional 100,000 barrels of natural gas.                                                                                                                         , It follows requests from its allies at a meeting of the world's energy ministers at the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris, which pledged to accelerate the move to clean energy.                                                                  , "We expect that by the end of the year we will be fully up to the 300,000 barrels," said Mr Wilkinson.                                                                                                                                                     , However, that is only a fraction of the three million barrels a day that the IEA says will be removed from global markets by next month because of sanctions against Russia.                                                                               , Canada is limited in how much oil it can export because its pipelines are running near full capacity, but Mr Wilkinson says sending it via the United States is an option.                                                                                 , Canada's biggest pipeline company Enbridge told the BBC it is "prepared to do what we can to increase energy security for both North America and Europe".                                                                                                  , The impact of Canada's extra supplies "will be relatively limited given the regionality of Canadian crude, which will likely stay in the North American market", according to Louise Dickson, who is a senior oil analyst at the consultancy Rystad Energy., "The main energy crisis is playing out in Europe due to supply shortages, and Asia where demand is on the cusp of recovering if Covid-19 lockdowns can be kept at bay," added Ms Dickson.                                                                  , Canada has joined the US and UK in introducing a ban on Russian oil. That has seen prices pushed up as high as almost $130 (£98.56) a barrel since the war in Ukraine began.                                                                               , Mr Wilkinson believes "there is a consensus" among the other energy ministers at the meeting that the world needs to cope without Russian oil and gas, adding: "I think the only differences are around how fast can you actually get away from it."       , However, the investment bank JP Morgan says it thinks the "current extreme aversion to Russian oil will subside" and that the price of a barrel of oil will fall back to about $100 in the second half of this year.                                       , The International Monetary Fund  is among those who have raised concerns that higher oil prices are causing costs of goods and energy bills to rise and that inflation is harming the global economy.                                                      , Mr Wilkinson said leaders must ensure that people "are able to heat their homes and that industries are able to produce the goods that we all need."                                                                                                       , In the longer term, Mr Wilkinson said he recognised that "energy security and fighting climate change are intimately linked".                                                                                                                              , Addressing immediate concerns, he argued: "Canadian oil displacing Russian oil doesn't cause more climate change. There's no more CO2 emissions."                                                                                                          , Having previously run a "clean energy" company, Mr Wilkinson said he was a big believer in using hydrogen and other renewable sources to create more energy going forward.                                                                                 , The variable nature of solar and wind power means "there is a role for nuclear in many jurisdictions in terms of providing baseload rather than intermittent power", Mr Wilkinson said.                                                                    , Russia plays a key role in the global nuclear power industry. As well as mining uranium, it does a lot of the processing to make it useable in power stations.                                                                                             , Canada is "absolutely" prepared to export more uranium, said Mr Wilkinson. He explained "our uranium producers actually do have excess capacity and certainly could ramp up to to help to fill the gap that Russian supplies will provide".                , The UN Secretary General didn't mention a role for nuclear power when he said a few days ago that the rush to use fossil fuels because of the war in Ukraine is "madness" and threatens the ability to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C.      , Mr Wilkinson said: "I think where the secretary general and I would agree very much... is the need to accelerate the work that we're doing on climate change.                                                                                              , "We are we are running out of time. There is no question about that - we need to make significant progress by 2030."                                                                                                                                       , He suggested that the war in Ukraine is underlining "how important it is not just from a climate perspective, although that's enough, it's from an energy security perspective that we actually do this now. We don't wait."                               , You can watch Jonathan Wilkinson's full interview on "Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst" this weekend.                                                                                                                                                , Viewers in the UK can watch the show on Sunday at 15:30 on the BBC News Channel.                                                                                                                                                                           , In other countries, it will be on BBC World News at Saturday at 12:30 &amp; 23:30 GMT and Sunday 06:30 &amp; 18:30 GMT.                                                                                                                                            , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Incredible technology takes you on an emotional journey deep inside!                                                                                                                                                                                       , Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle                                                                                                                                                                                                        , © 2022 BBC.

After 42 years with no leads, the local sheriff’s office wanted to try a relatively new technique pioneered in the Golden State Killer case, combing through consumer genetic databases to find the man’s relatives, however distant, to triangulate his identity. The local sheriff couldn’t afford it, so a genetics lab called Othram was panhandling on the internet.                                                  , Othram’s founder and chief executive, David Mittelman, a metaphor-loving geneticist, compares the forensic money request to Kickstarter. “Instead of a product, you’re getting justice for a family,” he said. “We’re crowdfunding for justice.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , That phrase has traditionally meant funding bail or legal bills for the accused, but Othram was seeking $5,000 to sequence the victim’s DNA. On a whim, Ms. Davis, a wellness coach who lives in Dubai, donated the remaining $3,897.52 needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , She didn’t stop there. Over the last year, Ms. Davis has given more than $100,000 to Othram, as if it were a charity rather than a venture-backed start-up, primarily for cold cases in Mississippi, her birth state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “A friend told me I should just invest in the company,” Ms. Davis said. “It didn’t matter to me that it wasn’t tax-deductible. These families have waited so long for answers.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Ms. Davis is part of a growing cohort of amateur DNA detectives, their hobby born of widespread consumer genetic testing paired with an unquenchable desire for true crime content. Why just listen to a murder podcast when you can help police comb through genealogical databases for the second cousins of suspected killers and their unidentified victims?                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , So far donors around the country have given at least a million dollars to the cause. They could usher in a world where few crimes go unsolved — but only if society is willing to accept, and fund, DNA dragnets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , It’s hard to commit a crime, or do anything, without leaving some DNA behind. While crime scenes may include incriminating genetic evidence from perfectly innocent people, “probative” DNA — material that is clearly relevant to an investigation, such as a bloodstain — can be a powerful clue. But only if investigators can match it to the right person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The case of the Golden State Killer, who committed 13 murders and dozens of rapes in California, went unsolved for decades, until the F.B.I. decided in 2018 to use DNA evidence from a sexual assault to build out the perpetrator’s likely family tree. The resulting identification and prosecution of a 72-year-old former police officer proved the value of what’s called “forensic genetic genealogy.”                                                                                                                                                                                 , What made the investigation possible was GEDmatch, a low-frills, online gathering place for people to upload DNA test results from popular direct-to-consumer services such as Ancestry or 23andMe, in hopes of connecting with unknown relatives. The authorities’ decision to mine the genealogical enthusiasts’ data for investigative leads was shocking at the time, and led the site to warn users. But the practice has continued, and has since been used in hundreds of cases.                                                                                                       , Because many local agencies lack the resources to participate, philanthropists have stepped in to help. A group of well-off friends calling themselves the Vegas Justice League has given Othram $45,000, resulting in the solving of three murder-rape cases in Las Vegas, including those of two teenage girls killed in 1979 and in 1989.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “We want to help the police and the community just knock these out,” said Justin Woo, an online marketer who founded the Las Vegas group. “It’s not quite ‘Minority Report,’ where you’re predicting and stopping, but if you get these people off the street through the DNA stuff, it’s really helpful.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In the publicized cases in Las Vegas, the perpetrators were dead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Mr. Woo said people had contacted him to ask if they could donate money to prioritize the case of a loved one. “I don’t have that ability,” he said. “But I can pass this along to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and they decide.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Natalie Ram, a law professor at the University of Maryland, expressed concern about “the public picking and choosing between cases,” saying investigative priorities could be determined by who can donate the most. Ms. Ram said the “largest share” of cases solved so far with the method “tend to involve white female victims.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , An existing bias toward prioritizing white victims, which has been documented in media coverage, could be compounded by the demographic makeup of the genealogy databases. Their composition “skews heavily white,” according to a recent law review article, which contrasted these databases to state collections of DNA, such as the F.B.I.’s Codis, which overrepresent Black people, who are more likely to be arrested and have their DNA taken.                                                                                                                                        , Ms. Ram is also concerned about the constitutional privacy issues raised by the searches, particularly for those people who haven’t taken DNA tests or uploaded their results to the public internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Even if you resolve never to put your DNA on a site accessible to law enforcement authorities, you share DNA with many other people so could still be discoverable. All it takes is your sibling, aunt or even a distant cousin deciding differently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , As donations pour in for these searches, the fortunes of the services that make them possible are also on the rise. The two main consumer databases used for law enforcement searches — FamilyTreeDNA and GEDmatch — have both recently been acquired by larger companies, while the DNA testing behemoths Ancestry and 23andMe, which have largely resisted police access to their databases, have valuations in the billions of dollars.                                                                                                                                                    , Even a former F.B.I. lawyer who worked on the Golden State Killer case is getting in on the action. Steve Kramer, who said he helped the F.B.I. establish three forensic genetic genealogy units across the country, left the agency in November to help found a company seeking to automate genealogical research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “I don’t consider genetic genealogy for just cold cases. We’ve solved active homicides within weeks,” said Mr. Kramer, who has already come up with a catchphrase. “We want to take the word serial out of serial killer.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The philanthropy is also being fueled by true crime, an entertainment genre that has come to dominate podcast charts. Audiochuck, an Indiana company with a slate of popular true crime shows, has donated approximately $800,000 to organizations doing investigative genealogical research, including Othram, but the majority has gone to a nonprofit started by Ashley Flowers, host of the network’s “Crime Junkie” podcast.                                                                                                                                                             , “What keeps me sane is knowing we’re doing something to make it better,” said Ms. Flowers, whose show largely consists of discussing murders in detail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The nonprofit, called Season of Justice, has raised another $250,000, some through crowdfunding, and so far, has made grants toward 53 unsolved murders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “I was pretty stunned when we put our PayPal button up and raised that money almost without trying,” said Steve DuBois, the nonprofit’s executive director. “This is the GoFundMe generation, this is what they do.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The processing of DNA evidence typically costs around $5,000. And then there’s the painstaking creation of the family tree by forensic genetic genealogists. This new breed of experts are often women, like Ms. Davis, who honed their skills initially as amateurs piecing together their own family history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , For most of her life, Carla Davis did not know who her father was. Her teenage mother, who had kept the man’s identity a secret, died in a motorcycle accident when Ms. Davis was 5 years old. Raised by her grandmother in a Mississippi town with just 2,000 people, a population that almost certainly included her father, Ms. Davis had no way to find out who he was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , That is, until four decades later, when relatively inexpensive consumer genetic tests became popular. Starting in 2013, Ms. Davis sent vials of her saliva to 23andMe, FamilyTreeDNA and Ancestry, which extracted and analyzed her DNA for about $100 each, and then provided lists of other customers to whom she was genetically related, unearthing third cousins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , From there, she tracked down census records, marriage licenses, death records, obituaries, and social media accounts to build out her unknown father’s family tree, much like putting together a puzzle, but one filled with relatives. After three years, she found the missing piece: Her father was a drag car racer who had lived mere miles from her childhood home. He had died of prostate cancer, but his brother took a DNA test to confirm the match.                                                                                                                               , “It felt like the weight of the world had lifted off me, like I had finally learned who I was,” Ms. Davis said. “I started learning everything I could about DNA and how to build trees.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , By then, Ms. Davis had moved from Mississippi to the United Arab Emirates, where her husband’s family-owned real estate company was based. Her daughter was grown and Ms. Davis was working as a nutrition and lifestyle consultant, advising people virtually. After absorbing books and YouTube tutorials about genetics, she joined a Facebook group called DNA Detectives, which led to a new calling: helping over 200 strangers identify their unknown parents.                                                                                                                         , “I’m a volunteer search angel,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ms. Davis funded the Tennessee murder victim’s case because she believed in the power of her hobby to help solve crimes. She also knew the pain inflicted when a loved one is missing; years earlier, her daughter’s 11-year-old friend was abducted and killed. “For three horrible days, we didn’t know her fate,” Ms. Davis said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Hours after Ms. Davis made the contribution, an Othram employee emailed, asking whether she’d really meant to donate almost $4,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “We don’t usually receive contributions of that size,” he wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr. Mittelman, Othram’s C.E.O., said his company had received more than $400,000 from philanthropic donors. According to Crunchbase, the start-up has also raised $28.5 million from institutional investors to corner the market around this new investigative technique. Founded in The Woodlands, Texas, in 2018, the company now has 30 employees, said Mr. Mittelman, including five full-time genealogical researchers, and will soon move to a new building, with a lab four times the size of its current one.                                                                        , Othram’s pitch is simple: Government labs lack the expensive equipment needed to process DNA evidence — cigarette butts, bloodstained fabric, bone — which may be decades old, degraded or mixed with nonhuman materials. For now, private labs must do the work of creating genetic profiles that are compatible with those generated, much more easily, from a consumer’s saliva. Then forensic genetic genealogists must do the time-consuming labor of sorting through third cousins and population records. Finally, another DNA test is typically required to confirm a suspected match., Othram wants to be the authorities’ one-stop shop for the whole process. “Once they see it, they are never going back,” Mr. Mittelman said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The company created a site called DNASolves to tell the stories of horrific crimes and tragic John and Jane Does — with catchy names like “Christmas tree lady” and “angel baby” — to encourage people to fund budget-crunched police departments, so that they can hire Othram. A competitor, Parabon NanoLabs, had created a similar site called JusticeDrive, which has raised around $30,000.                                                                                                                                                                                             , In addition to money, Othram encouraged supporters to donate their DNA, a request that some critics called unseemly, saying donors should contribute to databases easily available to all investigators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “Some people are too nervous to put their DNA in a general database,” said Mr. Mittelman, who declined to say how large his database is. “Ours is purpose-built for law enforcement.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Carla Davis has donated her DNA, as well as that of her daughter and son-in-law. Her husband declined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , After reassuring Othram that her large donation was intentional, Ms. Davis expressed interest in another DNASolves case: the “Talladega Superspeedway Jane Doe.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The decomposing remains of a white woman of average height had been found nine years earlier in the yard of an abandoned house near the famous racetrack. According to law enforcement officials, the deceased, who had lung cancer, had been wearing dentures inscribed with the word “Powders.” The local police department in Lincoln, Ala., believed her body might have been dumped by someone who planned to steal her identity to access her finances.                                                                                                                                 , Othram had come across the case while perusing the approximately 14,000 unidentified people cataloged in NamUs, a database maintained by the Justice Department, which describes when and where a body was found, its condition, and any clothing or accessories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The case seemed likely to have usable DNA, so in 2020, Othram contacted Shannon Hallmark, the Lincoln police captain of investigations, describing what the company could do if it could raise enough money. “A lot of small agencies don’t have the funding to do something like that,” Captain Hallmark said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The case jumped out to Ms. Davis because she had already researched families from the area while searching for someone’s parent. “I’m not sure if Othram accepts the help of volunteers,” Ms. Davis wrote in an email, “but if so, I would like to help solve this particular case.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , She donated nearly $4,000 again, so that Othram could process a bloodstain card collected during the woman’s autopsy, using a million-dollar DNA sequencing machine called the NovaSeq 6000. From there, Othram generated a data file containing her autosomal DNA, the genetic material that is shared among families. When uploaded to GEDmatch Pro, a special investigative version of the service, it revealed that the woman had over 1,000 distant relatives in the database.                                                                                                           , Othram asked Captain Hallmark whether she was interested in a civilian volunteer and Ms. Davis became part of the cold case task force, a scenario that Captain Hallmark called “very rare.” Then the sleuthing started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Ms. Davis works from a guest bedroom that she has converted into a his-and-her office decorated in the style of a high-end hotel room. She has the research abilities of a digital archaeologist, the can-do energy of a personal trainer and the fervor of a true believer. “This is what I know is my purpose,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , GEDmatch told her how many centimorgans, a measure of genetic linkage, each of the relatives shared with the victim. Ms. Davis fed the 25 closest relations into software called DNA Painter that predicted how they relate, to build a possible family tree: Is it a great-grandniece or a second cousin? She then used Ancestry.com to map the tree, keeping it private so only she could see it.                                                                                                                                                                                           , “The DNA unfolds and tells a specific story and you just have to follow the story and see where it leads,” Ms. Davis said. It’s not usually a story that unfolds easily. People on GEDmatch typically list anonymous email addresses. It’s one thing to put your DNA publicly on the internet, it’s another to explicitly say it’s yours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ms. Davis tries not to contact matches directly, particularly in a forensic investigation, because it could tip off a suspect or send a family into despair. So instead, to figure out the person behind an email address, she will turn to data broker sites such as BeenVerified that specialize in linking phone numbers and email addresses to names, home addresses and housemates (who could be other relatives). “It’s a tedious process,” Ms. Davis said.                                                                                                                             , In this case, the closest match shared a great-great-grandparent with the victim. Starting from there, Ms. Davis learned the family’s roots so intimately that she discovered an 1800s-era affair between an ancestor and a neighbor, another example of the surprising historical revelations encoded in our genes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , After five months of digging, Ms. Davis figured out where on the tree the victim had to be, a branch with two sisters. One was alive, but when Ms. Davis searched for the other on Facebook, she gasped at the post that came up: “Where is Jean?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A retired biology teacher and grandmother who had lived in Georgia, Jean Ponders had been declared missing in July 2013. “I was very emotional,” Ms. Davis said. “I finally had a face to look at.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Ms. Davis emailed her findings to Captain Hallmark, asking whether the “Powders” on the dentures could have been “Ponders.” Captain Hallmark got contact information for the Ponders family from local authorities, and a daughter, Jennifer Hazelwood, provided a DNA sample. It was a match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , For years, Ms. Hazelwood had longed to know her mother’s whereabouts, Googling her frequently. “My mind was tortured,” Ms. Hazelwood said. “It really touches my heart that someone cared enough to keep pushing to find her family.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Captain Hallmark is now investigating how Ms. Ponders got to Alabama from Georgia and who dumped her body in the yard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Carla Davis hopes that more family members like Ms. Hazelwood can get closure, but that is relatively rare so far. Beyond the funding issues, the genealogical databases have limited populations. Tens of millions of Americans have taken DNA tests, but only a small portion have made that DNA available to investigators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Of the 24 cases Ms. Davis has funded, seven previously unknown individuals have been publicly named, including, most recently, Gary Simpson, a 20-year-old Black man from New Orleans, whose remains were found in a Mississippi river in 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But some have stalled out, including the Tennessee murder victim. He is still unidentified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Heather Murphy contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

SailGP will expand from eight to 10 national teams for its third season.                                                                                                                                              , While the agreement with NEAR is expected to have many benefits for fans, including NFTs, the highlight would be ownership of a sailing team by a community of token-holders known as a DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The SailGP DAO would differ from traditional sports team structures in which a single owner or a small group calls the shots, said SailGP co-founder Russell Coutts and NEAR Foundation CEO Marieke Flament. The DAO could involve people from all over the world who vote on everything from the management structure to the length of the skipper’s contract and could even decide whether there should be a woman steering the boat.               , "That’s in some ways why this is so exciting," Coutts said in a video interview. "This is groundbreaking technology, a groundbreaking initiative. We don’t believe it’s been done before, especially on this scale. And when you think about it, with our events being all over the world, as well, we’re not just in one particular territory. That’s of interest as well."                                                                          , CRYPTO FOR UKRAINE PROVIDES A FLOW OF WAR-RELATED ASSISTANCE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Coutts, a New Zealander who has won the America’s Cup five times, said he expects a DAO would attract more than just sailors.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biden's off-the-cuff remark on Putin sends shock waves on dramatic final day of trip - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Warsaw, Poland (CNN)At nearly the same moment President Joe Biden declared him a "butcher," Vladimir Putin's missiles began falling in Lviv, Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Sending black smoke and flames billowing into the air, and injuring at least five people, the strikes on a fuel depot pierced what had been relative calm in the western hub city that had seen relatively little of the war that has engulfed the nation.                                                                                                                                         , The target hardly seemed coincidental. Biden was 250 miles away, visiting Ukrainian refugees in bitter cold at Poland's national stadium. He heard pleas from young mothers to pray for the men -- husbands, fathers, brothers -- they had left behind.                                                                                                                                            , "We Ukrainian mothers are ready to strangle (Putin) with our bare hands," said a woman whose son remained to fight. Gathering up a small girl wearing a pink coat and pigtails, Biden told her he wanted to take her home.                                                                                                                                                                         , When he returned to his hotel, aides briefed Biden on the strikes in Lviv. A few hours later on Saturday, propelled by heartache and anger, Biden walked into the courtyard of an old Polish castle to declare the Russian President "cannot remain in power."                                                                                                                                     , The very final words Biden would utter on his last-minute swing through Europe ended up being the most consequential, reverberating widely as Air Force One departed for Washington. They surprised his aides, many of whom spent hours honing the text of a speech viewed by the White House as a significant moment for Biden's presidency. The line Biden uttered wasn't in what they wrote.    , Gathered backstage at the castle, White House officials hastily issued a clarification -- one of several on this trip alone -- to say Biden wasn't calling for regime change. But not before the Kremlin issued its own affronted response, saying Russia's ruler is "not to be decided by Mr. Biden."                                                                                             , On Sunday, Biden told reporters he was not calling for regime change in his remarks, responding, "No," to a question shouted from a reporter as he was leaving church in Washington, DC.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The administration had continued to downplay the remarks earlier on Sunday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying from Israel, "I think the President, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else."                                                           , The series of events that unfolded here Saturday afternoon placed into sharp relief the highly unsettled atmosphere that pervades Europe as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second month. A display of aggression from Putin in the borderlands of Ukraine was followed by an offhand yet forcefully delivered suggestion from Biden that Russians find another leader.                    , "He went to the National Stadium in Warsaw and literally met with hundreds of Ukrainians. He heard their heroic stories as they were fleeing Ukraine in the wake of Russia's brutal war in Ukraine. In the moment, I think that was a principled human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day," Biden's ambassador to NATO, Julianne Smith, said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." , Biden's view of Putin had been growing increasingly dark over the past month, according to officials, and his language has sharpened in describing a "pure thug," "murderous dictator," "war criminal" and, after visiting refugees at the stadium, a "butcher."                                                                                                                                   , His aides have said Biden has been hoping to avoid the Cold War, Washington versus Moscow dynamic he believes Putin desires. Instead, he left Europe more directly at odds with the Russian leader than ever.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Whether that was his intention seemed unclear. The clarification the White House issued was at least the third time on Biden's trip a White House official felt obliged to clean up remarks the President made that appeared, on their own, startling.                                                                                                                                             , As he was hailing the heroism of the Ukrainians, Biden told US troops "you're going to see when you're there" -- even though he's vowed American forces won't be entering the conflict directly. Afterward, a spokesman said nothing had changed: "The President has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine."                                                                          , And after Biden said he would respond "in kind" to the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan assured reporters the United States has "no intention of using chemical weapons period, under any circumstance."                                                                                                                                      , Biden has a well-established pattern of speaking out of hand, though perhaps never with stakes so high. White House officials said before Biden's speech the President had been working intently behind the scenes to reinforce cooperation among his counterparts.                                                                                                                                , "He sleeps way less on these kinds of trips than maybe other trips because he's just going, going, going -- like, wants to talk to the next leader; you know, take the next briefing," Sullivan said Friday midway through Biden's flight from Brussels to Rzeszów in southeastern Poland, where he was meeting with American soldiers.                                                            , Biden heads back to Washington with some victories to tout at home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Coming exactly a month since Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden's snap visit to Europe was meant as a show of American resolve as the continent faces its worst conflict since World War II. Aides said after months of telephone calls and video conferences from his basement Situation Room in Washington, Biden wanted to come here to meet leaders face-to-face at a critical juncture in the war. , The timing of the summits was abrupt, leaving some European officials doubtful anything could possibly come from talks without the usual time to prepare. Some Western officials worried Biden's insistence on an in-person gathering was an attempt to force decisions on some of the remaining sticking points.                                                                                  , Others worried that instead of reinforcing unity among the allies -- which officials say has come as a shock to Putin -- the visit would instead expose the cracks that still do exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Still, they set to work engaging with their US counterparts to arrange the so-called "deliverables" -- those items leaders can announce afterward to show their various constituencies they are able to get things done.                                                                                                                                                                           , Even as Biden was flying to Europe on Wednesday, the talks continued. Aboard Air Force One, the President's various policy experts streamed in and out of his cabin in the nose of the airplane, updating him on progress toward the myriad items he was hoping to accomplish.                                                                                                                     , Biden's top national security aide described the scene like "speed dating with the President on every topic under the sun" -- albeit with stakes higher than perhaps any other moment in recent memory.                                                                                                                                                                                            , As it turns out, Biden's visit to Brussels did yield breakthroughs, including the announcement of a joint task force with Europe to wean it from its dependence on Russian oil and gas. Yet afterward, even Biden acknowledged the extraordinary last-minute gathering was unlikely to cause Russia to ease its slaughter in Ukraine, at least in the near term.                                   , "The answer is no," Biden said when asked directly whether anything that happened in Brussels would cause Putin to alter course. Instead, he said "the single-most important thing is for us to stay unified" for months to come, which he said would eventually erode Putin's ability and will to carry on.                                                                                       , "We have to demonstrate -- the reason I asked for the meeting -- we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , President steels the West for a long battle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , It was the clearest sign yet that 30 days into Russia's war, Biden and his team do not believe the bloody conflict in Ukraine is nearing an end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "This battle will not be won in days or months," Biden said during his speech on Saturday afternoon. "We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Even Russia's claim Saturday to be narrowing its military objectives was privately met with skepticism from American officials, who said they'd look instead to what Putin does with his forces in the country before making an assessment.                                                                                                                                                        , One of Biden's aims in visiting Europe was to inject a human dimension into his decision-making by meeting with refugees and those helping them, along with American soldiers he'd deployed along NATO's eastern edge to act as a deterrent to Putin.                                                                                                                                              , Biden said he had hoped to see more, longing to visit Ukraine itself to bear witness to its suffering. As a senator and vice president, Biden was a regular visitor to American war zones, a fact he mentioned when meeting troops positioned about 60 miles from the border with Ukraine.                                                                                                         , "I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan about 40 times," he recalled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Yet slipping over the border into Ukraine was never seriously considered by Biden's aides. Unlike a stop in Iraq or Afghanistan, where US bases and personnel can help secure the airspace, Ukraine is not an American war zone -- a fact that loomed over Biden's trip in ways both logistical and philosophical as he worked to define the next phase of the conflict.                           , For Ukrainians watching from their capital of Kyiv, this week's summits proved frustratingly disappointing. NATO leaders remain roundly opposed to calls for a no-fly-zone from President Volodymyr Zelensky, who didn't even bother asking again during virtual remarks to the NATO summit on Wednesday. Instead, he simply pointed out he'd never received a clear answer to his request.        , "We are very disappointed, in all honesty. We expect more bravery. Expected some bold decisions. The alliance has taken decisions as if there's no war," said Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, in a live interview with the Atlantic Council on Friday.                                                                                                              , Even Biden's pledge Wednesday to response proportionally should Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine was viewed as cold comfort by some Ukrainian officials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "What we heard is that it is OK for us to die of bullets, OK for us to die of missiles, OK for my people to die of hunger in the occupied cities. But if and when chemical weapons will be used, then there will be a change. You can imagine this was extremely painful, that this was extremely annoying," said Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian member of Parliament, interviewed by CNN's Hala Gorani.  , "If the whole world is so afraid of Putin, why is Biden saying we'll change our mind if there's a chemical attack? Do you understand how cruel this sounds?" Rudik asked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Others in the region -- at least those covered by NATO's collective defense alliance -- felt more assured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "We know what Russian imperialism stands for, and we know what it means to be attacked by Russian armed forces, because our grandfathers and great-grandfathers experienced that; sometimes even our parents experienced that," Polish President Andrzej Duda told Biden as they met Friday.                                                                                                       , "So, thank you for your presence," he said. "And thank you, first and foremost, for your incredible leadership."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , This story has been updated with additional reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , </td>

"Today, crypto is playing a significant role in Ukraine’s defense," Alex Bornyakov, the country’s deputy minister for digital transformation, wrote on the nation’s donation website.                                                                                                                                     , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Ukraine has spent about $34 million of the funds received as of last week, converting about 80% to traditional currencies and using the remainder with merchants that already accept cryptocurrencies, Bornyakov said in response to emailed questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , FILE - Members of Congress give Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a standing ovation before he speaks in a virtual address to Congress in the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center Congressional Auditorium in Washington, (Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times  ((Sarahbeth Maney/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File) / AP Newsroom)                                                                                                                                                                                             , The funds raised in cryptocurrency are a just small part of the overall donations that Ukraine has received. After raising as much as $12 million on March 2, cryptocurrency donations have tapered off although boosters say the unexpected initial surge may inspire other efforts to solicit cryptocurrencies for humanitarian or defensive purposes. Officials have said that the speed with which they can use cryptocurrency donations has made them useful.                                                             , The downside of that ease of transfer, of course, is that cryptocurrencies continue to be a magnet for scams and are the currency of choice for criminal networks. On Tuesday, European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde warned that crypto assets "are being used as a way to try to circumvent the sanctions " against Russia, but didn't provide details beyond noting that global transfers of rubles into cryptocurrency are rising sharply in volume.                                                                 , Michael Chobanian, the founder of a Ukrainian cryptocurrency exchange, is one of several people helping the Ukrainian government manage the donations through an informal agreement, Bornyakov confirmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "We are buying so much stuff that is saving lives every single day and also are stopping the aggression, so it’s a beginning of the new world," Chobanian said in a voice message sent via the app Telegram.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Chobanian said he was not receiving payment for his work but acknowledged that some of the funds are being converted through his cryptocurrency exchange Kuna.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "It’s certainly a first," said Bennett Tomlin, who investigates cryptocurrency scams and hosts the podcast Crypto Critic’s Corner. "We’ve never seen a sovereign nation fund their defense efforts in crypto before. It does prove out a lot of the crypto argument."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Bitcoins are seen in this illustration.

Proponents also argue that cryptocurrency doesn't require users to trust financial institutions because the system is managed by code that anyone can inspect and transactions are written indelibly into distributed public digital ledgers known as blockchains.                                          , CLICK HERE FOR FOX BUSINESS' REAL-TIME CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICING DATA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The donations to Ukraine are a stress test of sorts for those claims, some of which have fared better than others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , For example, services like cryptocurrency exchanges do act as gatekeepers in part because many are required to collect identifying information about the people who use their services. Two large cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and CoinBase, took action to limit use of some of their services in Russia earlier this month, although they have not withdrawn entirely.                                                                                                                                                  , The publicity around Ukraine's call for donations also attracted scammers who tried to capitalize on the good will of donors. Hilary Allen, a professor at American University’s law school who has written a book about the risks cryptocurrencies pose to financial systems, said anyone who donates should carefully look at all the actors involved.                                                                                                                                                                       , "Who is receiving the crypto? Who will be converting the crypto? You need to be thinking about them the same way you’d be thinking about any other charity or nonprofit you are donating to because they are intermediaries in just the same way," Allen said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Many of the donations to Ukraine’s accounts are verifiable on public tools that track cryptocurrency transactions – as are the transfers that are made out of the accounts Ukraine controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Tuan Phan, a cybersecurity professional who specializes in blockchain forensics, examined the flow of money to and from some of Ukraine’s accounts in part because he wanted to make a donation himself. Born in Vietnam, he said he was eight years old when North Vietnamese Communist forces took Saigon in 1975.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "I’m old enough to remember what happened, so I’m very empathetic to the Ukrainians," Phan said. "I wanted to make sure the address where I’m sending my donation is landing in the right places. There are lots of scams going on, so you have to be extra careful."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Another challenge presented by accepting cryptocurrency donations is the potential for people to send tainted assets obtained through crime or scams, Ukrainian cryptocurrency attorney Artem Afian said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , BLACKROCK'S FINK SAYS RUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS COULD BOOST DIGITAL CURRENCIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Even if some of the funds donated were gained through illicit activity, he said, "I think comparing the risks and benefits for Ukraine now — Ukraine is using every penny, every chance to support people, to support the army, so this is not a time when Ukraine can choose a lot."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , An illustration of various cryptocurrencies.

Ukraine's government is also receiving aid through multiple other channels, although not all of those flow directly to the government.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Congress has allocated $13.6 billion for Ukraine and President Joe Biden pledged an additional $800 million in military aid following Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to U.S. lawmakers last week.

The donations so far, he added, can "make governments see that working with crypto can be official and can be transparent and well run." </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Profits earned by China's industrial firms rose by 5.0% yoy to CNY 11.58 trillion in January-February 2022, compared with a 34.3% surge in 2021. Profits at state-owned industrial firms grew (16.7%) while those at private-sector fell (-1.7%),  amid production challenges due to COVID-19 outbreaks. Among the 41 industries surveyed, 21 saw profit rises, including oil and natural gas extraction (1.57%), coal mining and washing (1.55%),  non-ferrous metal smelting (63.8%), chemical products (27.3%), textile (13.1%), electrical machinery and equipment (5.7%), non-metallic mineral products (5.2%). In contrast, profits fell at computer, communications (-7.3%), general equipment (-15.7%), petroleum, coal, and other fuel (-39.6%), electricity (-49.1%), ferrous metal smelting (-56.5%), and electricity (-49.1%). This year, uncertainty over global supply chains due to the war in Ukraine and the potential for even higher commodity and energy prices may weigh on the bottom-line of Chinese firms. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ukraine war: Chernobyl’s vodka producer remains defiant </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> It started with "Chernobyl moonshine". Scientists who were studying crops grown in the Chernobyl exclusion zone decided to use some of their leftover grain to produce alcohol.                                                                                                                                                             , That experiment became a social enterprise that made and sold a spirit drink called, appropriately enough, Atomik.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The aim was to show that slightly radioactive fruit, grown in orchards in or near the contaminated exclusion zone that surrounds Chernobyl's nuclear power plant, could be distilled into a spirit that was no more radioactive than any other. Profits were channelled into communities that live in deprived areas close to the zone.     , Now, as Russian troops occupy the land where that fruit is grown and harvested, this unusual company is making a defiant marketing move by releasing two more "premium drinks" and donating profits to help Ukraine's refugees.                                                                                                             , While the future of an enterprise that makes a niche spirit might seem insignificant amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is an example of how decades of progress has been upended by war.                                                                                                                                               , After 30 years of studying the exclusion zone, the scientists who set up the Atomik project enabled people on contaminated land to sell their own produce. It was a small but significant milestone in the recovery of a patch of Ukraine that was largely abandoned after the nuclear catastrophe in 1986.                                 , "Now, that whole region where we harvest our fruit for production is occupied by Russian forces," explained Kyrylo Korychenskyi, an environmental researcher and member of the Atomik team.                                                                                                                                                 , Russian forces seized control of the now defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the first few days of the invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Military machinery kicking up radioactive dust in the usually carefully controlled zone caused a spike in radiation levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The information we're getting from the region is very bad," says Kyrylo. "Russian forces go into the villages and  put their tanks in the middle of people's gardens."                                                                                                                                                                     , In the heart of the exclusion zone, Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of looting and destroying a new research laboratory designed to process and analyse radioactive samples and to monitor the zone.                                                                                                                      , Prof Jim Smith is one of the founders of Atomik and a scientist at the University of Portsmouth. He has spent much of his career studying the exclusion zone and says that decades of progress is now being destroyed.                                                                                                                      , "The communities who have been suffering for 35 years are now suffering even more," he told BBC News. "We used to worry about the risk from radioactive strontium in [cities] that are now being bombed."                                                                                                                                   , The future of the Atomik project - and that of the people who live and grow fruit in their orchards near the exclusion zone - is uncertain.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , If the war has ended by the time the next harvest season comes around, Kyrylo - who remains in his home in Kyiv with his wife and children -  says he hopes to keep going. He hopes to go back to his "pre-war life" and pick up the project where he left off.                                                                             , "I think people there will need money and help because Chernobyl accident for this territory will no longer be the worst thing that happened there."                                                                                                                                                                                        , Follow Victoria on Twitter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Incredible technology takes you on an emotional journey deep inside!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sizewell C nuclear power station: Government to take 20% stake </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The government plans to take a 20% stake in a £20bn large-scale nuclear plant at Sizewell, the BBC has learned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , French developer EDF will also take a 20% stake in the Suffolk power station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ministers hope the confirmation of two cornerstone investors will encourage infrastructure investors and pension funds to take up the remaining 60%.                                                                                                                                                                                         , Sizewell C is a key part of the new UK energy strategy, anticipated this week. However, no decision is expected yet on the future of Wylfa, in north Wales.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Government officials say new nuclear facilities at Wylfa could - like Sizewell - be one of the "big bets on nuclear" the prime minister has said are integral to plans to reduce UK reliance on fossil fuels over time.                                                                                                                      , It's not yet clear whether these additional ambitions will include large-scale plants, smaller reactors based on nuclear submarine technology, or both.                                                                                                                                                                                      , The government's strategy will also include plans for solar and wind power, as well as stimulating additional investment in oil and gas fields in UK waters.                                                                                                                                                                                 , Legislation allowing construction and financing costs to be added to customer bills, as Sizewell C is built over the next decade, is due for a second reading in the House of Commons next month. It made it through the Lords unamended and is expected to become law in the coming weeks having received strong support  from MPs.         , EDF has insisted the amount added will be relatively insignificant, at about £2 a year for the first phase, rising to a peak of £12 a year.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The total cost of Sizewell C is expected to be about £20bn. That is slightly less than the plant currently under construction at Hinkley Point, in Somerset, as Sizewell C will be a near-identical replica, creating cost savings.                                                                                                          , However, those numbers are expected to rise as global inflationary pressures affect prices of steel, cement, wages and the large amounts of energy required to build plants of this size.                                                                                                                                                    , The £20bn in capital (at current prices) is expected to be financed with about one-third in equity - or cash up front - and the remainder in debt borrowed from financial markets.                                                                                                                                                           , The government has already committed £100m to the project's development. Taking a 20% stake would see that rise to between £1.5bn and £2bn.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Nuclear industry insiders say proposed reforms to EU-wide financial regulations (Solvency II) will make it easier for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in long-term infrastructure assets like nuclear.                                                                                                                       , While some Suffolk business groups would welcome the jobs and skills that would be brought to the local economy, there is significant opposition to the plant both at a local level and more widely from those who argue big nuclear is slow, expensive, old fashioned, risky and threatens local wildlife.                                  , Anti-Sizewell groups have mounted planning challenges and are expected to demand a judicial review of any approval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Campaign group Stop Sizewell C said: "We are appalled the government plans to throw billions of pounds in taxpayers' money at Sizewell C and hit households with a nuclear tax on their bills when renewable solutions, insulation, efficiency and energy storage will achieve energy security faster, more cheaply and with much less risk.", However, the government is convinced it is a source of non-imported, low carbon, "always on" electricity and has a target for nuclear to contribute 25% of the UK's power needs.                                                                                                                                                             , Nuclear currently produces about 16% of UK power but, of the eight plants still in operation,  all but one are due to be switched off by 2030. Only Hinkley Point C is currently under construction.                                                                                                                                         , That plant alone will produce 7% of current needs when it comes online in 2026.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The government is also keen to accelerate the development of smaller reactors, of the kind being developed by Rolls Royce, but designs for these are still at an early stage.                                                                                                                                                                , Critics argue other technologies like solar and wind are cheaper, faster and greener to deploy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , While the current energy crisis, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war, has made a powerful argument for weaning economies off volatile fossil fuels, it has also painfully demonstrated that point is still some way off.                                                                                                                   , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Incredible technology takes you on an emotional journey deep inside!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Louis Theroux discusses with comedian Frankie Boyle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Colombia's Attorney General's Office released a preliminary "forensic medical study" Saturday following the death of Foo Fighters' drummer Taylor Hawkins.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The report said a urine toxicology test was carried out on Hawkins and 10 substances were found, including THC, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines and opioids.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , It added, "The National Institute of Forensic Medicine continues the medical studies to achieve total clarification of the events that led to the death of Taylor Hawkins" and the attorney general's office will continue to investigate his cause of death in a "timely manner."                                                                                          , The band announced the news of Hawkins' death in a Friday statement, shortly before they were set to take the stage at a music festival in Bogotá.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The cause of death was not disclosed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "The Foo Fighters family is devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of our beloved Taylor Hawkins. His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever," the band said on Twitter. "Our hearts go out to his wife, children and family, and we ask that their privacy be treated with the utmost respect in this unimaginable difficult time.", The band's Friday performance was canceled just as fans began to gather, one festival attendee told CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Candles were later placed on the main stage as a vigil for Hawkins and the screens on five stages of the festival projected the message, "Taylor Hawkins Por Siempre," which translates to "Taylor Hawkins Forever."                                                                                                                                                        , News of Hawkins' death also came a day after the band announced it would take the stage at the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas April 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Hawkins was 50 years old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , CNN has reached out to Hawkins' representatives for further comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , CNN's  Aya Elamroussi, Michelle Watson and Jason Hanna contributed to this report. </td>

While many in his party have advocated taxes that target an individual’s wealth — not just income — Mr. Biden has largely steered clear of such proposals in favor of increasing the top marginal income tax rate, imposing a higher tax on capital gains and estates, and raising taxes on corporations., The “Billionaire Minimum Income Tax” would apply only to the top one-hundredth of 1 percent of American households, and over half of the revenue would come from those worth more than $1 billion. Those already paying more than 20 percent would not owe any additional taxes, although those paying below that level would have to pay the difference between their current tax rate and the new 20 percent rate.                                                                   , The payments of Mr. Biden’s minimum tax would also count toward the tax that billionaires would eventually need to pay on unrealized income from assets that are taxed only when they are sold for a profit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The tax proposal will be part of the Biden administration’s budget request for the next fiscal year, which the White House plans to release on Monday. In a document outlining the minimum tax, the White House called it “a prepayment of tax obligations these households will owe when they later realize their gains.”                                                                                                                                                             , “This approach means that the very wealthiest Americans pay taxes as they go, just like everyone else,” the document said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , As the administration grapples with worries over rising inflation, the White House also released a separate document on Saturday saying that Mr. Biden’s budget proposal would cut federal deficits by a total of more than $1 trillion over the next decade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The idea of imposing a type of wealth tax has gained traction since Mr. Biden was elected as Democrats have looked for ways to fund their sweeping climate and social policy agenda and ensure that the wealthiest Americans are paying their fair share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the Finance Committee, released separate proposals last year that would tax the wealthiest, albeit in different ways. Ms. Warren had championed the idea of a wealth tax in her unsuccessful presidential campaign.                                                                                                                                                 , The decision by the administration to call for a type of wealth tax also reflects political realities over how to finance Mr. Biden’s economic agenda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Moderate Democrats, including Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have balked at raising the corporate tax rate or lifting the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 37 percent, leaving the party with few options to raise revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Still, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, slammed the idea of taxing billionaires after Mr. Wyden’s proposal to do so was released, although Mr. Manchin has since suggested he could support some type of billionaires’ tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Top Biden administration officials have expressed skepticism about wealth taxes in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said last year that a wealth tax was “something that has very difficult implementation problems.” And Natasha Sarin, the Treasury Department’s counselor for tax policy and implementation, was a co-author of an opinion essay published by The Washington Post in 2019 that argued that a wealth tax would present “a revenue estimation puzzle.”                                                                                                 , Legal questions about such a tax also abound, particularly whether a tax on wealth — rather than income — is constitutional. If Congress approves a wealth tax, there has been speculation that wealthy Americans could mount a legal challenge to the effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said the White House proposal raised complicated questions about how taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service would assess the value of assets that are not publicly traded and how investments that lose money would be handled.                                                                                                                                                                                     , He said the proposed tax would be constitutionally “suspect,” particularly given the right-leaning makeup of the Supreme Court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Is there value in scoring hundreds of billions of revenues if we never collect them?” Mr. Rosenthal asked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Advertisement </td>

In addition to the Hollywood trades, he owns Rolling Stone, Billboard, Vibe and Women’s Wear Daily, and he has a controlling stake in the annual South by Southwest festival.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “Jay Penske has become the Rupert Murdoch of entertainment publications,” said Stephen Galloway, a former executive editor of The Hollywood Reporter who is now the dean of the Chapman University film school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The flurry of deals, announced in a steady drumbeat of news releases, was not all that sexy, given Mr. Penske’s focus on old-school publications at a time when Substack and TikTok were hot topics in media circles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But the moves have made him someone to be reckoned with, a mogul who can shape perceptions of Hollywood and its players. And his company has become a prime landing spot for the tens of millions spent annually on Oscars and Emmys advertising, a market that has heated up in recent years as streaming platforms spare no expense in their quests for prestige and attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr. Penske made himself into a publisher after growing up the youngest son of the automotive industry titan Roger Penske, a onetime professional racecar driver, known as the Captain, who started his business, Penske Corporation, once his racing days were done. The father’s success made the Penske name all but inescapable. On any street you may see one of the more than 360,000 trucks and vans belonging to his transportation fleet, with the family name in bold black lettering on the side.                                                                                             , Up until a decade ago, Jay Penske was one of many scions looking to move upward in Los Angeles. From the start, he was driven by a desire to make the family name known for something other than his father’s accomplishments, said the media entrepreneur Rafat Ali, who met Mr. Penske more than a dozen years ago. “I think he has a chip on his shoulder and wants to prove himself,” he said. “He was hustling back then not to be known as Penske — to prove himself not to the world, but to his family.”                                                                                        , Mr. Penske, who declined to be interviewed for this article, entered publishing in earnest in 2009, when he bought Deadline Hollywood Daily, a take-no-prisoners entertainment news site started by the journalist Nikki Finke. A few years later, it became apparent that his ambitions went beyond watching over a scrappy digital outlet, when he set his sights on Variety, the age-old show business publication that was challenged by the transition to online media.                                                                                                                            , The veteran Hollywood executive Sandy Climan put him in touch with Daniel S. Loeb, a hedge fund investor, and the two hit it off over breakfast at the Montage Beverly Hills. Months later Mr. Penske called Mr. Loeb to say he was closing in on a Variety deal — but his financing had collapsed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “He’s super-close to his dad,” Mr. Loeb said. “His dad could have written that check in a heartbeat. But I think Jay would rather have let the deal go off the rails before going to his dad for anything other than emotional support.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mr. Loeb’s fund provided the $26 million in debt and equity Mr. Penske needed to clinch the sale. (That investment made Mr. Loeb a part owner of Variety; Mr. Penske has since bought back his stake, Mr. Loeb and a Penske Media spokeswoman said.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , After acquiring Variety, he continued his spree, picking up faded properties at bargain-bin prices. In 2014 he bought Fairchild Fashion Media, the owner of Women’s Wear Daily, from Condé Nast. In 2017 he bought Jann Wenner’s 51 percent stake in Rolling Stone; two years later he acquired the remaining 49 percent, after a cash infusion from a Saudi company. In 2020 Mr. Penske bought 80 percent of The Hollywood Reporter, Billboard and Vibe.                                                                                                                                               , Last year he made his move on South by Southwest, becoming a majority shareholder in the annual tech, film and music festival, which had run into money troubles because of the pandemic. (It made its return this month, after having been shut down the last two years.) Along the way Mr. Penske added ARTnews, Art in America, Dirt, Beauty Inc. and Spy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Jay grew up with great wealth, but in L.A. there are rooms that are not open to just any rich guy,” said Matthew Belloni, who leads entertainment industry coverage for a new publication, Puck, and who was the top editor of The Hollywood Reporter before Mr. Penske took over. “Owning all of these publications makes him a must-know.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , In an industry that rewards attention seekers, he stands apart because of his penchant for privacy. He avoids red carpet events, almost never gives interviews and has no social media footprint. “He prefers to let the brands speak for themselves,” a Penske Media spokeswoman said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Penske lives in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles with his wife, Elaine Irwin, 52, a former Victoria’s Secret and Calvin Klein model who was previously married to the rock star John Mellencamp, and their daughter. He keeps an apartment in New York and recently bought a private island in the Bahamas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , He grew up in New York City, Monmouth County, N.J., and Bloomfield Hills, Mich., where Penske Corporation has its headquarters. Family vacations took place at Deer Valley in Utah, a ski resort that was partly owned by his father from 1987 to 2017. “They were a country club family,” said Tom Bernard, the co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, who lived for a time near the Penskes and knew the young Jay.                                                                                                                                                                                  , One of five siblings in a boisterous, competitive family, he distinguished himself in hockey and lacrosse at the Lawrenceville School, a boarding school in New Jersey, and Orchard Lake St. Mary’s, a Catholic prep school in Michigan. He was an all-state hockey player, and in 1997 he was named an All-American lacrosse player. A photo of him still hangs in a St. Mary’s athletic facility, showing him mid-stride on the lacrosse field in his No. 7 jersey, which the school retired.                                                                                                         , His father is a grand figure, beloved in the racing world. He started Penske Corporation in 1969 after racking up 55 victories behind the wheel. One of his company’s divisions owns the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the home of the Indy 500. Another subsidiary runs Team Penske, the organization whose drivers have won more than 600 races. In 2019, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Jay Penske and Ms. Irwin were among the guests in the Oval Office who looked on as former President Donald J. Trump placed the medal around the patriarch’s neck.                          , Jay showed signs that he would go his own way not long after his 2001 graduation from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He moved to Los Angeles and threw himself into businesses that had nothing to do with the nuts, bolts and engine noise of the family trade. An early venture was Firefly Mobile, a company that offered phones designed for children, with large buttons. He also bought promising URLs, including Mail.com, which he built into an email portal business and eventually sold at a profit.                                                                  , The writer A. Scott Berg, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Charles Lindbergh and a National Book Award for his study of the editor Maxwell Perkins, was a friend and mentor to Mr. Penske when he was new to Los Angeles. The two bonded over their shared love of books, Mr. Berg said in an interview, adding that he was struck by the younger man’s apparent distaste for Hollywood and the media.                                                                                                                                                                                     , “When I met Jay Penske, he viewed two industries with contempt: show business and magazines,” Mr. Berg said. “For whatever reason, he seems to have changed his mind. Maybe he recognized their commercial value, or maybe he came to appreciate their content. One thing I knew from the night I met him in the summer of 2002 was that he was a serious bibliophile.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Penske gave full expression to his passion when he opened a bookshop in the Beverly Glen neighborhood of Los Angeles. He named it Dragon Books, after a collection of tales he had loved as a child, “Dragon, Dragon,” by John Gardner. The store, with its 18th-century French mantel, wood paneling and Doric columns, became a favorite of antiquarian book lovers. Two hundred people, including his parents, attended the opening in 2006, and Mr. Berg did a brief write-up for Vanity Fair.                                                                                                  , “While a serial prep-school expellee, he became a serious reader of 19th-century novels,” he wrote of Mr. Penske. “Soon he began collecting, starting with works by Kierkegaard and Mencken. When moving to Los Angeles in 2002, he discovered he had 28,000 volumes, half of which he’s now selling to sustain his passion for new acquisitions. He shelved each book himself, and he often mans the cash register.”                                                                                                                                                                                   , He didn’t hold himself entirely aloof from his father’s world. In 2007, with the investor Steve Luczo, he started an IndyCar team, Luczo Dragon Racing. Now fully owned and operated by Mr. Penske and called Dragon Racing, it has competed in the Formula E racing series, for electric cars, for nearly a decade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In 2009, he dove into publishing with the purchase of Deadline. Built on Ms. Finke’s lively voice, it was a gleefully rude digital upstart that made Variety and The Hollywood Reporter seem like house organs for the movie studios and talent agencies. Mr. Penske and Ms. Finke added some reporting muscle when they lured Nellie Andreeva away from The Hollywood Reporter and Mike Fleming from Variety. Deadline’s minuscule staff regularly scooped the competition.                                                                                                                            , “Belfast.” In this charming memoir, the director Kenneth Branagh recalls, through a rose-tinted lens and black-and-white photography, his working-class childhood in a turbulent Northern Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “CODA.” A shy 17-year-old is the lone hearing member of her rambunctious family.

The gossip site Gawker took notice of him — at age 30 he was seen at parties in the company of the Benihana heiress Devon Aoki — and labeled him “the hard-partying Si Newhouse Wannabe of Bel Air,” a reference to the longtime Condé Nast chairman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Ms. Finke left Deadline after Mr. Penske’s purchase of Variety amid reports that she preferred that he remain focused on Deadline, rather than attempt to revive a competitor. She started a new blog and used it to refer to him as “Little Lord Fauntleroy.” After mediation with Mr. Penske, she shut down the site; since then, she has not reported on the entertainment industry. (Ms. Finke declined to comment.)                                                                                                                                                                                , Her onetime colleague Mr. Fleming had nothing but praise for the publisher. In an interview, he noted that Mr. Penske flew to New York to attend the wake for his father, who died in 2012 from injuries sustained during Hurricane Sandy. “That told me everything I needed to know,” said Mr. Fleming, who is now Deadline’s co-editor-in-chief with Ms. Andreeva.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The visit took place during an eventful time for Mr. Penske. The year 2012 was also when he got arrested in Nantucket. According to a Nantucket Police Department report, Mr. Penske and his brother Mark were urinating in a parking lot outside the Nantucket Yacht Club late at night when a woman approached. “Jay turned and continued to urinate on her boots,” the report said. After the woman alerted the police, the brothers apparently tried “to flee.”                                                                                                                                     , An officer intercepted Jay, and his brother was found on the back staircase of an apartment building, according to the report. The Penskes were locked in a police station cell, only to be released soon afterward. Coverage of the incident was widespread, with reports in Auto Week, The Daily Mail, ESPN and Politico, among other publications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Mr. Penske has not spoken publicly of that night and has kept his silence when faced with public criticism in other instances. One came after his 2017 purchase of a Black church in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles for $6.3 million. Mr. Penske’s plan to convert it into a home for his family drew protests. He has since sold the property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In 2018, he accepted a $200 million investment from the Saudi Research and Media Group, a publicly traded company. The investment became a point of contention later that year, when Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who wrote a regular opinion column for The Washington Post, was murdered and dismembered in a Saudi consulate office in Turkey. The United States government concluded that the killing had been carried out by a team reporting directly to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler.                                                    , Mr. Penske did not publicly address the investment, even as his publications reported on the pressure faced by companies with financial ties to Saudi Arabia. In some articles, the Penske outlets mistakenly reported that his company had received money from the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which is overseen by Prince Mohammed, rather than the Saudi Research and Media Group. After The Wrap reported on the matter, a number of Penske Media articles were updated to correct the error.                                                                                                     , “PMC has disclosed the small minority investment from SRMG to all of its stakeholders and brands,” a Penske Media spokeswoman said in a statement. “Any statement to the contrary is purely an attempt to create a false narrative. It is further disclosed in every article any PMC brand writes about Saudi Arabia.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Ten Penske Media employees interviewed for this article describe their boss as someone who stepped up for publications in trouble. “Jay Penske came in and saved this business,” said Dea Lawrence, the chief operating and marketing officer of Variety. “He is a hero to the publishing world.” His company has more than 1,350 employees, according to the Penske Media vice chairman Gerry Byrne, nearly half of them journalists and content creators.                                                                                                                                             , After the company bought a controlling stake in Vibe and Billboard, which have offices in New York, he flew there to meet with each new employee. “This was in the middle of the pandemic, and so I thought, ‘Wow, this guy is serious!’” said Datwon Thomas, the editor in chief of Vibe. Mr. Thomas met Mr. Penske for lunch at Bryant Park Grill in Midtown. “Jay knew a lot about me and my background,” he said, “and he knew a lot about Vibe.” Four other Penske Media employees said that Mr. Penske makes a practice of meeting with each of his new employees soon after acquiring a property., Mr. Penske will sometimes play hardball with the staff. When Tatiana Siegel, a longtime Hollywood Reporter journalist, accepted a job at The Ankler, a subscription newsletter started by the show business writer Richard Rushfield that has expanded under the former Hollywood Reporter top editor Janice Min, Mr. Penske put a stop to the move. Ms. Siegel’s contract included a noncompete clause, and Mr. Penske held her to it. The parties eventually agreed that Ms. Siegel would decamp to Rolling Stone, committing 80 percent of her work to it, with the remainder going to The Ankler.   , “Jay has been by far the best owner I’ve worked under at The Hollywood Reporter,” said Ms. Siegel, who joined the magazine in 2003. “My situation was unique, and it was resolved amicably.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The upstart publications Puck and The Ankler pose a new threat to Penske Media’s hold on entertainment coverage. The competition is reminiscent of what took place more than a decade ago, when Deadline had the old guard quaking. Mr. Rushfield said that start-ups may have an advantage over entrenched publications, because they are not beholden to anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “If you’re at a publication like Variety, for example, the number of things a studio has over you is hard to keep track of,” Mr. Rushfield said. “You need friendly access to studio executives and agents gift wrapping your scoops. You need people for covers. You need people to speak at your conferences.” The result, he continued, is that “publications with different business models, and more aggressive reporting, can elbow their way in.”                                                                                                                                                , Mr. Penske may be able to counter the newcomers through the magic of synergy. The addition of South by Southwest has given him another way to promote all things Penske. The latest iteration of the festival, which is in Austin, Texas, included concerts hosted by Rolling Stone and live episodes of podcasts from The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Shortly before the first day, Variety published a glowing article headlined “‘SXSW Is My Whole Life’: An Ode to the Austin Festival as It Makes Its In-Person Return.” You can read it online, where, up until Oscar voting ended on March 22, it was surrounded by For Your Consideration ads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

Theaters? Ticket sales? It didn’t matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Hollywood establishment, or at least most of it, was incensed: Big screens, they argued, are part of the very definition of cinema. “Once you commit to a television format, you’re a TV movie,” Steven Spielberg told a reporter at a European press junket at the time. “You certainly, if it’s a good show, deserve an Emmy, but not an Oscar.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , And now?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Unless the predictions are wrong and something unexpected awaits inside those gold leaf-embossed envelopes at the 94th Academy Awards on Sunday, a streaming service film — in a first — will win the Oscar for best picture. “CODA,” a dramedy from Apple TV+ about the only hearing member of a deaf family, is favored to receive the prize, having already won top honors at the predictive Producers Guild Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards and Writers Guild Awards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A Netflix film, “The Power of the Dog,” could nudge past “CODA” to win the best picture trophy, awards handicappers say. But most are not predicting a win for nominees from traditional studios, including “Belfast” and “West Side Story.” Apple TV+ and Netflix have both campaigned aggressively, with Apple spending an estimated $20 million to $25 million to promote “CODA” and Netflix’s push for “The Power of the Dog” costing even more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , For an industry in turmoil, with tech giants like Apple and Amazon upending entertainment-industry business practices and threatening Hollywood power hierarchies, the welcoming of a streaming service into the best picture club would amount to a seismic moment. Television and film have been merging for years, but lines of demarcation remain, with the Oscars as one. (Last year’s winner, “Nomadland,” from Searchlight Pictures, a traditional studio, was mostly seen on Hulu, but only because a lot of theaters were closed; it played in roughly 1,200 theaters in the United States and had an exclusive IMAX run.)                                                                            , Among this year’s best picture nominees, “I think there’s a lot of the academy that might not even know what is a streaming movie and what isn’t a streaming movie,” said the producer Jason Blum, whose Oscar-nominated films have included “Get Out,” “Whiplash” and “BlacKkKlansman.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The digital forces that have reshaped music and television have been chipping away at cinema for a long time. “If ‘CODA’ and Apple win, which seems pretty likely, it will be in part because of Netflix, which has been banging on the academy door for years, and fighting the good fight — or the bad fight, depending on who you ask — to get streaming movies considered,” Mr. Blum said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The pandemic accelerated the disruption. Traditional studios like Paramount, Universal, Sony, Warner Bros. and Disney rerouted dozens of theatrical films to streaming services or released them simultaneously in theaters and online. For the second year in a row, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, citing the coronavirus threat, allowed films to skip a theatrical release entirely and still be eligible for Oscars. The academy had previously required at least a perfunctory theatrical release of at least a week in Los Angeles.                                                                                                                                                   , This is about more than Hollywood egotism. The worry is that, as streaming services proliferate — more than 300 now operate in the United States, according to the consulting firm Parks Associates — theaters could become exclusively the land of superheroes, sequels and remakes. The venerable Warner Bros. has slashed annual theatrical output by almost half and built a direct-to-streaming film assembly line. Last week, Amazon boosted its Prime Video service by acquiring Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the old-line studio behind “Licorice Pizza,” which is nominated for three Academy Awards, including best picture.                                                                                 , In a year when Hollywood largely failed to jump-start theatrical moviegoing, streaming services solidified their hold on viewers. Global ticket sales totaled $21.3 billion in 2021, down from $42.3 billion in 2019, according to the Motion Picture Association. (Theaters were closed for much of 2020.) Some theater companies have gone out of business, others have merged; the world’s biggest theater chain, AMC Entertainment, racked up $6 billion in losses over the past two years and its stock has dropped 66 percent since June. At the same time, the number of subscriptions to online video services around the world grew to 1.3 billion, up from 864 million in 2019, the group said.      , One film that struggled at the box office was Mr. Spielberg’s “West Side Story,” which received an exclusive run in theaters (per his wishes) of about three months. It collected about $75 million worldwide (against a production budget of $100 million and global marketing costs of roughly $50 million). “West Side Story” is now available on not one but two streaming services, Disney+ and HBO Max, where it has almost assuredly been viewed more widely than in theaters. But the film was never able to recover — among Oscar voters — from being branded a box office misfire. It received seven nominations, and is poised to win in one category, for Ariana DeBose as best supporting actress., Mr. Spielberg’s also-ran presence in the current Oscar race makes the ascendance of streaming contenders all the more striking: a lion in the fight to keep the Academy Awards focused on theatrical films is pushed aside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , However unlikely, it is possible that “West Side Story” could come from behind and win the best picture trophy. So could Kenneth Branagh’s “Belfast,” for that matter. Such an outcome would be a bit like 2019, when academy voters, turned off by an over-the-top campaign by Netflix to push “Roma” to best picture glory, instead gave the prize to “Green Book,” a traditional film from Universal Pictures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In 2019, the Oscars-centered clash between Old Hollywood and New was so heated, particularly on Twitter, that the Justice Department sent an unusual letter to the academy warning that changes to its eligibility rules could raise antitrust concerns. At the time, there was a push inside the 10,000-member academy to come up with a reasonable way to ensure that only films with robust theatrical releases were eligible for Oscars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Flickers of resistance remain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “There are many great companies that are streamers that like to loosely throw around the word ‘cinema’ without supporting it as cinema,” said Tom Quinn, chief executive of Neon, the indie studio behind “Parasite,” which won the 2020 Oscar for best picture, and “The Worst Person in the World,” a screenplay and international film nominee this year. He was referring to the tendency by the majority of the streaming companies to limit a film’s theatrical release, opting instead to release it on their apps.                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Belfast.” In this charming memoir, the director Kenneth Branagh recalls, through a rose-tinted lens and black-and-white photography, his working-class childhood in a turbulent Northern Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “CODA.” A shy 17-year-old is the lone hearing member of her rambunctious family.

He soon begins cycling through women, including a clairvoyant whose husband once had a successful mentalist act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “The Power of the Dog.” Phil Burbank has been playing cowboy his entire adult life, raising cattle on his family’s Montana ranch for decades. When his brother George marries a widow with a teenage son, a lifelong family dynamic is disrupted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “West Side Story.” Steven Spielberg’s remake of one of Broadway’s most celebrated musicals — a modern take on “Romeo and Juliet” — centers on the forbidden love between Tony and Maria, who are involved with two rival street gangs in Manhattan’s West Side in the 1950s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , For Mr. Quinn and others, it is partly an existential conversation. Letting audiences control the presentation of a movie is antithetical to everything movies are supposed to be, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “The reality is seeing some of these movies at home on a portal — when you are in complete control, and you can turn them off, and walk away, and you can alter the way the film is edited by virtue of how you see it — it’s no longer cinema,” Mr. Quinn said. “At some point, the ubiquitous nature of streaming content being available at all times everywhere, at your convenience, with no commitment, it really does alter the relationship between the audience and the filmmaker’s vision.”                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Even so, most filmmakers have waved a white flag. Martin Scorsese is making his next film for Apple TV+ and worked with Netflix on his previous one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Because they don’t have to worry about ticket sales — subscriptions are what counts — streamers are often willing to spend more for projects than traditional studios. Increasingly, streaming services are where the eyeballs are, particularly young ones, which translates to “relevancy” in Hollywood’s mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The only thing streaming companies have left to do is deliver the ultimate Oscar glory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Advertisement </td>

But 2021, the first full year of the pandemic, may look different when it comes to your taxes.                                                                                                                                                                 , You may have collected a third stimulus check and a more generous child tax credit, including some of it in advance. You may not have stepped foot into your workplace for an entire year, and decamped to a different state. Or maybe you jumped into the meme stock pandemonium, putting you among the millions of Americans who started trading stocks last year.                                                        , If you’re worried about tax surprises, this is your guide to what to watch out for. And here’s some good news: You have a couple of extra days to sort it all out. For most taxpayers, returns must be filed online or postmarked by April 18.                                                                                                                                                                              , What if I’m missing a stimulus payment, or think I am eligible for more?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Now is your chance to recover it, using the so-called 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The economic impact payments that went out in March 2021 were for up to $1,400 per person, including dependents. Individuals with adjusted gross income up to $75,000 ($112,500 for individuals filing as a head of household) and married couples filing jointly with income up to $150,000 qualified for the full check.                                                                                                  , Payments phased out at $80,000 for singles, $120,000 for household heads and $160,000 for joint filers. But if you welcomed a new child or experienced a drop in income, you may be entitled to more than you received. (If you received too much, you don’t need to pay it back.)                                                                                                                                          , Those who received payments should have gotten a form listing the amount, Letter 6475. You can also find the information by setting up an individual online account on the I.R.S. website. (Spouses filing jointly will have separate accounts.)                                                                                                                                                                            , How will the expanded child tax credit affect me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , For 2021, the total credit for eligible families rose to as much as $3,600 for each child under 6 and up to $3,000 for ages 6 to 17. The credit also became fully refundable, so taxpayers can receive the money even if they owe no federal income tax.                                                                                                                                                                    , The other change: You could receive half the credit upfront, in the form of monthly payments. Whether you took those payments or opted out, you’ll have to enter the amount you received on your return — even if it’s zero. (Joint filers will have to add theirs together.)                                                                                                                                               , You should have received a form, I.R.S. Letter 6419, with this information. It, too, can be found by setting up an online I.R.S. account. Check the letter against your bank account — some letters may be inaccurate.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Some households will need to repay some or all of the advance: The payments were generally based on the prior year’s tax return and could have been too high if your situation changed significantly. There are repayment protections for lower- and middle-income households.                                                                                                                                              , What’s happening with the child and dependent care credit?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , This tax break helps many working parents offset the cost of caring for younger children and other dependents. Pandemic legislation made it far more generous, but only for 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The dollar amount of qualifying expenses nearly tripled, and the percentage of those expenses that can be applied to the credit rose to 50 percent from 35 percent. It also lifted income ceilings on when the credit begins to phase out, making more families eligible.  And because it became a fully refundable credit in 2021, you may receive money back even if you have no tax liability.                           , Filers can’t double dip, though: If you set aside pretax money through an employer-provided flexible spending account or your employer paid for child care, payments made with those funds aren’t allowable expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Are my health and dependent care flexible spending accounts any more flexible this year?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , They might be, if your employer chose to make pandemic-related changes. Employers can allow workers to carry over unused balances from 2021 into 2022, just as they did last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , You can also use health care flexible spending money to pay for masks, sanitizing wipes and other personal protective equipment, which now qualify as a medical expense for tax purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , I was lured into the meme stock madness. What do I need to know?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The federal government is coming for its share of your winnings. If you were trading in a regular brokerage account (and not a tax-advantaged individual retirement account, for example) and made a profit, you may owe capital gains taxes.                                                                                                                                                                               , Short-term gains — those realized after selling shares held for one year or less — are taxed at your ordinary income rate. The more favorable long-term rate kicks in when shares are held for more than a year. (Higher-income investors will often owe an added “net investment income tax” of 3.8 percent on gains, regardless of how long they held the stock.)                                                         , Losses offset winnings, and up to $3,000 in net capital losses can be deducted from your ordinary income. Any remaining losses carry into future years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , There’s a catch that could surprise many amateurs, known as wash sales. If, for example, you sold shares at a loss and then quickly bought them back again,  the initial loss can’t be used to offset other gains. Your brokerage should have sent you a Form 1099-B laying out your gains, losses and disallowed wash sales.                                                                                               , If you quit your job to trade full time, you could potentially qualify for what’s known as trader tax status. Robert A. Green, chief executive of Green Trader Tax, which specializes in tax planning for traders, said that status could allow you to deduct some significant expenses and take advantage of other benefits. (You can get more flexibility on wash sales, too, but it’s now too late to get that for 2021)., I continued to work from home. Can I write off certain expenses?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Probably not, unless you were self-employed, a gig worker or an independent contractor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Not even part of the phone bill? A desk chair? “That is still going to be a no, unless you have a business of your own,” said Cherie Mason, president of Cornerstone Tax and Financial Solutions in Denver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The home office deduction was eliminated in late 2019 for employees from 2018 through 2025. So if you receive a paycheck or W-2 exclusively from an employer, you’re out of luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , I worked outside my home state. Does that matter?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Yes, and it could get complicated — each state has its own rules related to remote work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In certain situations, you could end up owing taxes to more than one state. You generally pay income taxes to the state where you work (even temporarily), but your home state can levy taxes of its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , This may mean filing two state returns, although many states have reciprocity agreements that permit people to work in another state without having to file a nonresident return. (A glaring exception: New York, New Jersey and Connecticut do not have such pacts.)                                                                                                                                                       , But this doesn’t usually result in double taxation: All states allow residents to take a credit on their tax return for income taxes they paid to other states, said Tim Bjur, an analyst for Wolters Kluwer.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , If you didn’t notify your human resources or payroll department that you were temporarily relocating, you will need records of where you worked and when. For example, if you temporarily moved to Florida (which doesn’t impose a state income tax) from New York (which does), you’ll need to prove your Florida residency.                                                                                               , “Where they are allocating their income to becomes important because of the different state tax rules” and rates, said Jody Padar, head of tax strategy at April, which provides tax software to banks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , I moved. Is there anything special I can deduct?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Probably not. Most people can no longer deduct moving expenses, unless they are a member of the armed forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , I collected unemployment last year. Are those benefits taxable?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Unfortunately, yes. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal income tax — a partial shield for 2020 wasn’t carried into 2021 — but some states don’t tax it, according to the Tax Foundation. Either way, you won’t owe the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare.                                                                                                                             , Taxes for unemployment aren’t automatically withheld from the payments — recipients must opt in. But even when they do, it’s not always enough. It can be “a big shock,” said Dan Herron, an accountant and financial planner in San Luis Obispo, Calif.                                                                                                                                                                    , Unemployment recipients should receive Form 1099-G showing how much they received and any taxes withheld.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , My student loan was forgiven. Are there tax consequences?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , You’re (probably) in luck. A forgiven loan amount is generally counted as taxable income, but recent legislative changes make an exception for most student loan borrowers whose debt has been erased from 2021 through 2025, according to Wolters Kluwers.                                                                                                                                                                 , This covers loans forgiven because borrowers were defrauded by their schools or they qualified under the expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Many — but not all — states mirror the federal government’s treatment, so you may owe state tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Is student loan interest still deductible?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Yes, but federal borrowers may have less to deduct because the government hasn’t charged interest on most loans since March 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Borrowers can generally deduct up to $2,500 in interest on qualified student loans, subject to certain income limits, even when they don’t itemize deductions. But the pause means many people aren’t paying anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Interest accrued on other eligible loans, including certain federal loans not owned by the government and those made by private companies, can be deducted as usual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , What about charitable contributions?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , You can deduct up to $300 in cash contributions ($600 for joint filers) to qualifying charities for the 2021 tax year, even if you don’t itemize deductions. People who take the standard deduction usually can’t do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , And filers who itemize can deduct up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income for cash contributions made in 2021. The maximum had been 60 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Has the earned-income tax credit changed for 2021?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The earned-income credit, which benefits lower- and middle-income households, became more generous and flexible. Expanded age limits covered more childless people, and the size of the credit nearly tripled for these taxpayers.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Filers can also swap in their 2019 income to calculate the credit if it will generate a larger benefit than if they used their 2021 income. This may help people who were out of work for long stretches of 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , There are more tweaks for 2021 and future years, including allowing more working households that also have some investment income to claim the credit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S&amp;P Revises Saudi Arabia's Outlook to Positive </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rating agency S&amp;P revised Saudi Arabia's outlook to positive from stable and affirmed the country's rating at A-/A-2, citing improving GDP growth and fiscal dynamics over the medium term. Saudi GDP rose by 3.3% in 2021, rebounding from a 4.1% contraction in 2020 as oil prices surged 50% fueled by a recovery in demand. Oil prices surged further this year to 14-year highs above $120 per barrel after Russia invaded Ukraine. The agency forecast Saudi real GDP growth for the current year to rise to 5.8% and average 2.7% from 2023 to 2025. Demand for Saudi crude oil has been further underpinned by demand as some countries attempt to reduce imports from Russia, S&amp;P said. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Ibovespa, closed little changed at a near seven-month high of 119,081 on Friday, ending above the flatline for the eighth consecutive session. Private educational company Cogna was the top performer, rising more than 35%, after releasing upbeat Q4 corporate results. Airlines companies also advanced. Meanwhile, investors weighed concerns over the worsening crisis in Ukraine and the impact of a looming monetary tightening cycle. On the domestic economic front, Brazil's inflation grew more than expected in the month to mid-March, pushed up by spiking gasoline and food costs, complicating the central bank's plans to stop the tightening cycle in May. For the week, the index gained 3.3%. </td>

Leading the charge in Canada on Friday, the healthcare sector, which includes cannabis producers, surged about 5% as the US House of Representatives will consider a bill to decriminalize marijuana next week. For the week, the energy sector outperformed as supply concerns fueled an over 10% surge in crude prices. The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies also rose. Meanwhile, preliminary data pointed to a 3.7% advance in retail sales in February, driven by strong sales in the motor vehicle, petroleum and coal, wood, and food product industries. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Dow Jones rose more than 150 points in a choppy session on Friday, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5% while the Nasdaq edged down 0.2%. Financial shares outperformed as the 10-year yield jumped to above 2.5%, the highest since early May 2019. On the other hand, high-growth stocks were hit the most as the prospect of higher interest rates threatens to undermine the valuations of tech companies in particular, whose profits lie further in the future. Meanwhile, investors continued to assess whether increasing inflation and higher interest rates would drag the US economy into a recession. Treasury Secretary Yellen said she expects the world's largest economy to remain resilient despite the Russia-Ukraine war. A similar view came from Fed chair Jay Powell during the latest policy meeting. Still, markets started to bet on a higher probability of the Fed lifting rates by 50 rather than 25 basis points in May. All three major averages notched second consecutive winning weeks. </td>

Oil prices had been trading lower before the news of the attack, after the European Union didn't ban much-needed oil from Russia, like its U.S. counterpart did earlier this month. The European Union can't sanction Russian oil completely, but the attack on an oil facility reminds traders that Yemen's Houthi rebels have the ability to shut down production in Saudi Arabia, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group.

        TEVA,
        +5.51%
       hiked up 5.0% toward a six-week high in afternoon trading Friday, putting them on track for a ninth-straight gain, after Bernstein analyst Aaron Gal turned bullish on the "long suffering" generic drug maker. The stock, which has suffered yearly declines the past six years, has run up 16.6% over the past nine sessions, and is headed for the longest win streak since the 10-day stretch that ended Jan. 15, 2019. Bernstein's Gal said even after Teva has paid down more than $9 billion in debt and stabilized its free cash flow, it still trades at close to historically low valuations. "Teva is now trading at a valuation that makes material further decline unlikely short of insolvency risk," Gal wrote in a note to clients. "While we remain uncertain of the company's outlook in the longer term, there seems to be enough here to argue for positive risk-reward expectations."

"Fidelity has an unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional outcomes for plan sponsors and participants in our target date funds."            , Vanguard managed roughly $1.2 trillion of TDF assets at the end of 2021, about 36% of the total market, according to Morningstar.

"Cheaper mutual fund target-date series have attracted more investor interest than those with higher price tags."                                                                                                                                     , The Fidelity Freedom Index, Vanguard Target Retirement and Schwab Target Index have the lowest fees among target-date mutual funds, according to Morningstar.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures settled lower on Friday as traders continued to watch developments in the Russia-Ukraine war and assessed the largely hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials this week. "Gold prices have recovered some of their mojo this week, although we still remain well below the highs of this month," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. The continued rise in U.S. Treasury yields "hasn't prevented gold rebounding this week, however it could dim the appeal of a retest of this month's peaks." April gold

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The JSE FTSE All Share index closed virtually unchanged at 74,325 on Friday, as modest gains in banks and financials were offset by losses in miners and tech stocks. Investors remained cautious about central banks’ tightening policies amid persistent inflation, while also watching the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Locally, the government warned that South Africa faces a possible fifth wave of Covid infections in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, South Africa has relaxed some of its remaining COVID-19 curbs earlier this week, amid a steady decline in cases, in a move expected to boost tourism.

Domestically, Spain's economy expanded 2.2% from October to December of 2021 compared with the previous quarter, up from a preliminary estimate of 2%, signaling resilience despite a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. However, some Spanish truck drivers have been striking for nearly two weeks due to soaring fuel prices, with widespread effects across several sectors, which will likely weigh on growth. For the week, the Ibex 35 lost about 1%, following two consecutive weeks of solid gains. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s 10-year government bond yield topped 2.5%, a level not seen since November 2018, as expectations of higher interest rates continued to dent appetite for government debt. The Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnight rate by 25bps to 0.5%, the first hike since October 2018, reiterating it will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to the 2% target. The Governing Council expects interest rates will need to rise further as the economy continues to expand and inflation pressures remain elevated. On top of that, investors have been digesting the Federal Reserve monetary tightening. The US Central Bank hiked interest rates by 25bps, signaling six more rate hikes this year to rein on higher inflation, which is running at a four-decade high. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Volatility continued to grip equities on Friday, with the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 paring early gains to trade around the flatline and the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling by nearly 1%. High-growth stocks were hit the most as the prospect of higher interest rates threatens to undermine the valuations of tech companies in particular, whose profits lie further in the future. On the flip side, energy stocks tracked higher oil prices while financial shares rose as the 10-year yield jumped. Meanwhile, investors continued to assess whether increasing inflation and higher interest rates would drag the US economy into a recession. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she expects the world's largest economy to remain resilient despite the Russia-Ukraine war. A similar view came from Fed chair Jay Powell during the latest policy meeting. Still, markets started to bet on a higher probability of the Fed lifting rates by 50 rather than 25 basis points in May. </td>

While the Swiss National Bank kept rates unchanged at -0.75%, SNB Chairman Jordan said that the central bank will take all necessary measures to control inflation, including the possibility of a transition away from the ultra-loose monetary policy the bank mandated since 2016. The change in rhetoric came after the SNB doubled its inflation expectations for year-end 2022 to 2.1%. In the meantime, Fed policymakers expressed further support for a 50bps hike in May, while money markets expect the ECB to increase its interest rate by 50bps until year-end. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South Africa 10-Year Government Bond Yield rose to 9.7% as investors anticipated the inflationary impacts of the war in Ukraine will spur aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks. The South African Reserve Bank lifted its benchmark rate by 25 basis points for a third straight meeting to 4.25% and signaled it will raise borrowing costs more aggressively through 2024, citing risks to the inflation outlook from the war in Ukraine. Policymakers revised sharply higher inflation forecasts for 2022 but also upgraded growth projections for 2022 and 2023, as higher commodity prices should benefit South Africa's economy. Still, the country needs to address persistent structural issues, in particular recurrent load shedding, high unemployment rate, corruption, and slow progress in economic reforms. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Palladium futures traded below $2,340 per tonne, a level not seen in four weeks, amid easing fears of supply disruptions. Western countries so far haven't sanctioned Russian platinum group metal exports, with mining giant Nornickel saying that it has managed to secure alternative routes for its palladium deliveries even though it faced significant logistics constraints. Also, the recent surge in palladium prices is likely to accelerate the shift from palladium to platinum for use in catalytic converters, which, in turn, should limit any upside momentum. </td>

Revenues increased 27.7 percent year-on-year to CAD 35.9 billion, due to improvements in all components. Program expenses excluding net actuarial losses were down 15.2 percent to CAD 38.2 billion, largely reflecting decreased transfers under the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and Canada Recovery Benefits; and net actuarial losses decreased 33 percent in large part due to an increase in prevailing interest rates at the end of 2020–21 used in valuing these obligations. </td>

At the same time, all-time high inflation in the euro area extended the bond selloff that saw money markets price two quarter-point hikes in 2022, compared with previous expectations of one such increase. </td>

It was the highest jobless rate since the three months to November of 2009, as the number of unemployed increased by 400 people to 12,800 and the employed population fell by 5,400 to 373,600. The hardest hit activities were construction; restaurants &amp; similar activities; and gaming &amp; junket.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Economic activity in Mexico increased 1.8 percent year-on-year in January of 2022, picking up from the 1.3 percent rise in December and in line with market expectations. Growth was mainly lifted by manufacturing activity (4.3 percent vs 3 percent in December) and the services sector (0.6 percent vs 0.2 percent). On the other hand, growth in agricultural activities rose at a slower pace (0.4 percent vs 8.4 percent). On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, economic activity rose by 0.4 percent, easing from the 0.9 percent jump in the previous month. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Consumer prices in Macau eased to 0.81 percent year-on-year in February of 2022, from 0.99 percent in the prior month. It was the slowest rate of inflation since last August, as lower rents, telecommunication charges, and pork prices partly offset rising costs with household services, takeaway, electricity, fuel, and fruits. Accordingly, main upward pressure came from household &amp; furnishing services (9.86 percent vs 8.97 percent in January); transport (4.58 percent vs 4.38 percent); and food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages (1.78 percent vs 1.28 percent). On a monthly basis, consumer prices inched up 0.09 percent, after a 0.24 percent increase in the prior month. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 bounced back from intraday losses on Friday, nearing levels seen before the war Russian invasion of Ukraine, as traders digested an unexpected decline in February retail sales, while continuing to monitor the response of the West to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On corporate news, HomeServe stocks climbed more than 1% after Canada’s Brookfield Asste Management said it was mulling a possible offer for the British home repair services provider. On the earnings front, engineering company Smiths Group saw 1H 2022 profits stay unchanged from the previous year, while revenues went up 3.7%. Meanwhile, United Utilities’ trading update mentioned expectations of higher revenues this year, driven by business client demand, while inflationary pressures will likely leave underlying profits unchanged. On the week, the index headed for a 1.2% gain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY China began locking down most of its largest city of Shanghai on Monday as part of its strict COVID-19 strategy, amid questions over the policy&amp;#39;s economic toll on the country.

Shanghai&amp;#39;s Pudong financial district and nearby areas will be locked down from early Monday to Friday as citywide mass testing gets underway, the local government said. In the second phase of the lockdown, the vast downtown area west of the Huangpu River that divides the city will then start its own five-day lockdown Friday.

Residents will be required to stay home and deliveries will be left at checkpoints to ensure there is no contact with the outside world. Offices and all businesses not considered essential will be closed and public transport suspended.

Already, many communities within the city of 26 million have been locked down, with their residents required to submit to multiple tests for COVID-19. And Shanghai&amp;#39;s Disney theme park is among the businesses that closed earlier.

Today I listened to the latest episode of the All-In Podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNTXao9AZB4) 
In my opinion, David Sacks was DING DANG on point in how America is handling this Russia invasion of Ukraine over long, stankin&amp;#39;, stale grudges. 
 
I had to let David know he&amp;#39;s so very on point.  NOBODY thought America needed this on January 1st and we purposely and opportunistically avoided diplomacy to prevent it.

What we saw last 2 weeks is that all the algos have been trained on datasets for the last 30 something years.

In that timeframe, every time we have had a recession, the fed has lowered rates.

This time around, we are entering a recession, and fed is raising rates and reducing its balance sheet, as evidenced in the bond market.

The algo&amp;#39;s haven&amp;#39;t been trained on such a scenario. There will come a point, when the algo&amp;#39;s realize it is much less risk to put the money in treasuries and bonds, and will yank out money from the market. The floor from stocks will collapse, and we will see one of the reddest weeks ever. </td>

2. That brings us to indexes. For argument sake, say they do go down. 40%. Say in 4 years. return? 40% max if u shorted shares. Now count shorting fee u will pay over 4 yrs. Plus how much can u short
3. But We short using options. Haha oh baby u think over 4 yrs u can make decent money on options? 😂u will get taken out both way. Call n put
4. we can buy VIX. Haha baby won’t work either. They bleed on time decay even though they are shares 😂
5. So let me tell u all. U all lost life time of opportunity u will never see in ur life again. Apr’20- Dec’21. U could’ve loaded any stock n came out big fat rich fella

🌽Another Melt-Up Occurring...🌽 
 
&amp;quot;This chart of European Ammonia (fertilizer) prices is probably one of the most concerning in the world at the moment🌽 
 
It makes the previous record high in 2008 look like child&amp;#39;s play. 
 
This rising input cost will feed into the cost of food around the globe&amp;quot; 
 
… the unintended #food shortages as a result of this will be sad &amp;amp; hard to imagine. The same #inflation Spirale can be seen in #fertilizer.  
 
🌽Enjoy the food riots people of Earth! It&amp;#39;s not what will break but how many pieces actually stay together. </td>

Biden should be careful with his words. He is making the dangerous situation even more dangerous. Stop provoking the mad dog! This war has to stop, it’s impacting real ppl and honestly with other countries doing bilateral agreements with Russia, this will hurt the dollar power in the world market if the issue is not resolved soon!

Apple: Plan For iPhone Subscriptions Could Be Massive - Here&amp;#39;s Why. ??

* Bloomberg reported that Apple is considering a hardware subscription strategy for its devices.
* We discuss why it could help Apple penetrate more effectively into Android&amp;#39;s traditional strongholds and take share.
* We also discuss why AAPL stock is a Buy.
* While the $429 iPhone SE 5G holds promise, the Street has projected just about 30M units this year. Furthermore, DIGITIMES also reported that Apple shipped about 25M to 30M units of its previous iPhone SE in 2020 in its first year of release.
* China&amp;#39;s 5G smartphone penetration rate has already reached about 80%. 
* AAPL stock is slightly overvalued, but not by much. Therefore, if you need a higher margin of safety, youth can consider taking a 10-15% haircut.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $UPST Does anyone else find it a bit curious? 
 
On Mar 2, Seeking Alpha posted an article &amp;quot;suggesting&amp;quot; why UPST was down 60% from its highs. They said it was two fold; a sell down in the fintech sector &amp;amp; concerns about a possible rise in default rates. 
 
The stock went from $139 to $156 that day. With the market continuing to decline, &amp;amp; the Nasdaq hitting new 52 week lows, UPST backed up to $85. However, the Nasdaq has since bounced 1600+ points. In the process, the stock price also rebounded very fast to $130+ once again.  
 
And lo &amp;amp; behold, here comes Wedbush citing &amp;quot;possible&amp;quot; increases in default rates because the stock went up. Does it ever end for these criminals? Even though UPST is on record saying any increase is &amp;quot;normalizing&amp;quot; and has ZERO effect on their forecasts? 
 
Remember $AAPL with a $1 trillion lawsuit? New all time highs immediately. $TSLA with a $5 BILLION secondary? The stock immediately doubled.

Would create minimum 20% rate on income above $100M 
 
400 billionaire families paid *8.2% federal rate* from 2010-18 
 
-- America&amp;#39;s ~700 billionaires saw wealth increase by $1 trillion in 2021 
 
-- Proposed billionaire tax would raise $360 billion over 10 years 
 
-- If enacted, wealthiest would have 9 years to be in compliance w/ new 20% minimum rate. 5 years going forward

Many who said it “overvalued” and all that bs but still said they don’t short Tesla. Many talking about being burned shorting Tesla lol I do trade puts intraday at times if I’m comfortable doing so. I also hedge swing trades with puts with our current macro environment. Never ever would I buy a long dated otm put on Tesla to hold. Yes I’m sure there are plenty of times those have made money. I just don’t see the risk being worth while. It’s growing at such a rapid pace there is always a new catalyst that can drop at any time. This the only stock I really trade anymore, it’s all I really need to trade. Can’t wait to see what this is trading at in just a few years time </td>

Production will be halted Monday, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly.  
 
Tesla hasn’t yet informed employees whether it will extend the suspension beyond Monday, they said. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  
 
Shanghai will lock down half of the city in turns to conduct a mass testing blitz to combat a Covid-19 outbreak that’s turned it into China’s biggest virus hotspot.  
 
Areas in the east of the Huangpu River, where the Tesla plant is located, will be locked down on Monday for four days.  
 
Tesla has not yet told its employees how long the production shutdown would last, though many of its workers would face lockdowns where they live.

One day before 2030 Uber will be obsolete. Driverless electric cars using a Dapp built on Ethereum will be connected with those that need rides. No middleman needed. 
 
As the consumer, we won&amp;#39;t have to pay Uber their greedy cut. We won&amp;#39;t have to pay a human driver for their time. We won&amp;#39;t have to pay the gas bill. Just the car company for the electric charge and miles driven. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA interested to see how it plays out with Shanghai news. IMO I don’t think it’ll dip that much if it even does. To add to that, MM have clearly saved this a few times already from any real pullback. We saw what happened with the last quarter delivery numbers. This is expected to be even bigger than last quarter along with giga Texas event coming up. I think we’ll see bullish volume from traders this week. If not I “suspect” MM will save it from any real drop as most will just double down on 4/8 calls risking a massive gamma squeeze on blowout delivery numbers. Can never go really say for sure in this market. Just my opinion looking at it from all angles. </td>

1. We know all major blue chips r down more than 50% from highs with exception of very few which are solid companies. So not like those will go to $0 or be 50% less of what they are now
2. That brings us to indexes. For argument sake, say they do go down. 40%. Say in 4 years. return? 40% max if u shorted shares. Now count shorting fee u will pay over 4 yrs. Plus how much can u short
3. But We short using options. Haha oh baby u think over 4 yrs u can make decent money on options? 😂u will get taken out both way. Call n put
4. we can buy VIX. Haha baby won’t work either. They bleed on time decay even though they are shares 😂
