   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian economy grew by 1.6 percent on the fourth quarter of 2021, the steepest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2020 and following a 1.3 percent expansion in the third quarter. Growth was underpinned a swing in investment in inventories (CAD 22 billion in Q4 vs CAD -19.6 billion in Q3), largely due to the accumulation of business inventories (+CAD 11 billion) driven by manufacturers and wholesalers. At the same time, business gross fixed capital formation rebounded (2 percent vs -4.4 percent), lifted by residential structures (2.4 percent vs -8.9 percent). On the other hand, net domestic demand contributed negatively to Canada’s GDP, due to a rebound in imports (3.4 percent vs -0.4 percent) while exports grew to a lesser extent (3.2 percent vs 1.7 percent). Year-on-year, Canada’s GDP rose 6.7 percent in Q4. Considering the full 2021, the Canadian economy expanded 4.6 percent, after a 5.2 percent contraction in 2020 brought by the pandemic. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian monthly GDP was essentially unchanged in December of 2021 following six consecutive months of growth, defying market expectations of a 0.1% rise. The services-producing industries went up only 0.1%, as the rapid spread of the Omicron variant was predominantly felt in client-facing industries, namely retail trade (-2.7%); accommodation &amp; food services (-1.5%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (-3.7%). At the same time, the goods-producing industries shrank 0.1%, led by mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction (-2.2%) and construction (-0.6%). In 2021, activity was up in 17 of 20 industrial sectors as the economy rebounded (+4.9%) from the sharp contraction recorded in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to preliminary data, the Canadian GDP for January likely grew 0.2%. </td>

       said Tuesday that it now expects a minimum shareholder distribution of $250 million for the divestiture of its stake in the Wella haircare brand, up from $175 million previously. The company expects to receive the distribution in the next two months, and Coty will use the money to pay down debt. "Following our strong deleveraging progress during 2Q22, the expected upsized shareholder distribution from Wella should be a meaningful step in the further reduction of debt," said Coty Chief Executive Sue Nabi in a statement. "We remain confident in our guidance for mid teens [like-for-like] sales growth in 3Q22, assuming no significant deterioration in the demand backdrop." The FactSet consensus is for sales of $1.155 billion, implying 12.4% growth. Coty stock edged up 0.3% in Tuesday premarket trading, and has gained 13.6% over the past year. The S&amp;P 500 index

On Tuesday, Brent crude was up more than 6 percent, to $104 a barrel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The meeting is being called amid concerns that sanctions imposed on Moscow by Western nations could result in reduced flows of energy from Russia, which supplies one in 10 barrels of oil globally as well as around one-third of the European Union’s natural gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank, said in a note to clients that she expected that “the U.S. will soon tap its strategic petroleum reserve as part of a broader” release coordinated by the international agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Barring a breakthrough in peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, there was a risk of a large portion of Russian oil exports being crimped as a result of the sanctions, even though Western governments have said that they do not intend to disrupt energy flows, analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note. If so, oil prices could go as high as $120 a barrel, the analysts forecast.                                                                         , So far, loadings of tankers of oil and liquefied natural gas from Russia are proceeding as normal, said Alex Booth, head of research at Kpler, which tracks shipping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But, he added, a liquefied natural gas tanker coming from a facility partly owned by TotalEnergies in Russia and named for Christophe de Margerie, the French giant’s former chief executive who was killed in a plane crash in Moscow in 2014, had recently changed its destination from Britain to France after London barred Russian-linked ships from British ports.                                                                                                          , Potential relief could come from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, which are expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss the oil markets. So far, there is little indication that the group is willing to do more than agree to go ahead with its usual 400,000 barrels a day of additional supply in April.                                                                                                                                     , Saudi Arabia, the co-leader of the group, called OPEC Plus, has been talking with Biden administration officials about the oil markets, but a deal does not yet seem to have been reached. Discussions are likely to be complicated because Russia is the co-leader of OPEC Plus.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , And it is uncertain if there will be enough support at the meeting for an increase in production beyond 400,000 barrels a day. The United Arab Emirates, which along with the Saudis would be expected to be a source of additional oil supplies, recently abstained from the U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That decision “underscores the likely unwillingness” of some countries to bolster production at this time, Ms. Croft said., Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> German Inflation Rate Accelerates to 5.1% </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Annual inflation rate in Germany rose to 5.1 percent in February of 2022 from 4.9 percent in the previous month and in line with market expectations, a preliminary estimate showed. Covid-19-related effects such as delivery bottlenecks and significant price increases at upstream stages in the economic process as well as in energy product prices continue to pressure prices. These effects are superimposed by uncertainties caused by the Russian attack on Ukraine. Cost of goods rose 7.9 percent, accelerating from a 7.2 percent increase in January, mainly boosted by energy (22.5 percent vs 20.5 percent) and food (5.3 percent vs 5 percent). Meanwhile, services inflation eased to 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent. On a monthly basis, consumer prices are expected to increase 0.9 percent. </td>

        +1.13%
       said Tuesday its fourth-quarter loss increased to $133.89 million, or 36 cents a share, from $111.71 million, or 31 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue increased to $25.8 million from $17.05 million. Cronos booked a $119.9 million impairment charge in the latest quarter as a result of plan to exit its Peace Naturals Campus. Analysts expected a loss of 11 cents a share on revenue of $23.9 million, according to a survey by FactSet. "Our fourth quarter 2021 results indicate positive momentum, which we will look to carry forward as we begin to implement our strategic and operational realignment initiatives," CEO Kurt Schmidt said in a statement. Shares of Cronos group fell 4.8% in premarket trades., Oil surged when crude markets were rattled by supply fears, and gold was lifted by investors looking to ride out the volatility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Steve Gelsi covers banking and cannabis as a Senior Reporter for MarketWatch. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lviv, Ukraine (CNN)A long line of men snakes out of an unassuming building in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on an overcast day. An officer tells them to come back later. Too many people, he says, had enlisted that morning at Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, the volunteer military unit of the country's armed forces.                                                                                          , The scene recurs on nearly every street — office and manual workers, young and old, determined to take up arms. Nearly everyone here says they would rather die than see Russian ground forces enter their city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "I don't have any fear. We've had a war for eight years. This is a fight for our freedom," said Taras Ischyk of the territorial defense, referring to the war Russian President Vladimir Putin sparked in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine eight years ago.                                                                                                                                                                 , Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has so far left Lviv unscathed. Yet the city has been utterly transformed from a touristic hotspot that boasts picturesque cobble-stoned streets and baroque-style buildings to a hub of burgeoning resistance to Moscow's military assault.                                                                                                                                                , Checkpoints line the entrances to the city as volunteers fill up sandbags that fortify the city's perimeter as well as its inner-city government buildings. Ukrainian police are dressed in combat gear. Many businesses have answered a call by the region's authorities to join the war effort — namely by making Molotov cocktails.                                                                                          , The war effort in Lviv follows a nationwide trend where Russia's invading forces have faced stiff resistance from both Ukraine's military, as well as civilians who have taken up arms, slowing down the offensive's progress significantly. Russia has acknowledged casualties but has yet to give exact figures, but US officials say the country has suffered heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected. , In a press conference last week, Governor of the Lviv region Max Kozicki announced that Molotov cocktail production centers were being set up throughout the city, and called for a mass enlisting in the territorial defense.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Yuri Zastavny has converted his Lviv beer brewery into a factory for Molotov cocktails. They've made hundreds so far, Zastavny says, and distributed them to civilian defense centers in the Lviv area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Zastavny was encouraged to do it by his employees, he told CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "Everyone is mobilized to the highest extent possible ... people who have technical skills do technical things. People good at media do media things," he said. "That's why I think Russia has no chance here."                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The heightened sense of preparedness is an unexpected turn for Lviv. On the first day of Russia's invasion, several military facilities were attacked in the wider region. Every day since, air raid sirens have blared repeatedly. Across the city, people have descended into basements, re-emerging when the alarms stop.                                                                                                    , Just 50 miles away from the border with Poland, the city is on Nato's doorstep. When the US warned that an invasion was imminent, several Western embassies relocated there from the capital Kyiv, believing it to be safer. But that sense of security has since been shattered and the city's authorities already believe that they are the target of covert military operations by the Russian army.                         , "There are Russian infiltrators in Lviv. This is a fact," Governor Kozicki told CNN emphatically. The governor's office says they believe "sabotage groups" have been marking various spots in the city as targets for Russian forces to later attack.                                                                                                                                                                          , Neither the governor nor his office have provided evidence of the alleged infiltrators or the plots of the alleged sabotage groups, but the atmosphere in Lviv is thick with suspicion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Cafe-goers are sometimes frisked at the entrance. The city's inhabitants are much less forthcoming with journalists than they were prior to the invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "I can barely remember what life was like a couple of days ago when everything was safe," said 30-year-old Sergei Kuchman, who has been receiving scores of fleeing Ukrainians at a hostel he manages. "Everything changed in a moment."                                                                                                                                                                                        , At a historic church, Micha, 24, and his girlfriend inquire about bomb shelters; many people who don't have basements have taken cover in crypts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "What we can't find is a proper shelter for an atomic attack," he said, his voice trailing off as his girlfriend gestures to him to stop talking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , He ducks into an alleyway but the fear in his mind hangs in the air after he's left. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin put his country's nuclear deterrence force on high alert, raising the specter of nuclear war.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , A few days ago, this would have been an unfathomable prospect, but no one here says they can put anything past Putin anymore, especially after he invaded Europe's second-biggest country last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Hours before the invasion began, a group of men were meeting at a nondescript office on the ground floor of a Soviet-style building in the outskirts of Lviv. They were organizing a "national resistance movement in Lviv," 42 year-old Andriy Djakovych said.                                                                                                                                                                 , Djakovych is a hulking, slow-moving man with labored breathing. He is a senior lecturer at the local police academy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , When he served in his country's 2014 war against Russia in the Donbas region as a paramedic, he was left with a brain injury that means he can no longer serve in the army, or the territorial defense. Yet he still wants to join the resistance.                                                                                                                                                                              , He said his group had no name or political affiliations, and that they were operating on the belief that Lviv figured in Putin's invasion plans, even if to a milder degree than eastern and central parts of the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "I don't think (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky has prepared us for war," Djakovych said at the time. "We want to create our own patriotic community that the state in Ukraine can rely on."                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Days later, CNN met with Djakovych again. This time we were directed to a building in central Lviv where we used a password to enter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Djakovych's towering figure appeared in military attire. "Patriot" — the name of his little-known group — was emblazoned on his shoulder. The walls were draped with the flags of ultra-nationalist Ukrainian movements, including the paramilitary group Azov, whose logo is the Wolfsangel, a symbol appropriated by Nazi Germany.                                                                                            , There were several swastikas in the room, including one on a candlestick. Other veterans, decked out in military attire, brandished rifles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The "Patriots" are still tight-lipped about their ideological affiliations, but their ultra-nationalist leanings conjures up a less visible, yet harrowing dimension of this conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "I don't consider myself a Nazi or a neo-nazi," said Djakovych. "I'm just a patriotic citizen of my country."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , CNN's Atika Shubert, Jim Sciutto and Shelby Vest contributed to this report from Lviv, Ukraine. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Residential and commercial security company ADT Inc. shares 
        ADT,
        -0.14%
       rose 4% premarket Tuesday, after a revenue beat and upbeat guidance offset an unexpected loss for the fourth quarter. The company had a net loss of $58 million or 7 cents a share, for the quarter, narrower than the loss of $112 million, or 14 cents a share, posted in the year-earlier period. The company's adjusted loss came to 3 cents a share, while the FactSet consensus was for EPS of 19 cents. Revenue edged up to $1.381 billion from $1.315 billion, ahead of the $1.315 billion FactSet consensus. The company said it entered the residential solar market in the quarter after completing the acquisition of Sunpro Solar in December, and launched its ADT Solar product, offering rooftop and energy storage to save on bills. It also launched the Google Nest Doorbell in January that is now part of its ADT smart home offering. The company has also entered a partnership with Ford 
        F,
        -1.51%
       to help secure its vehicles using Ford's video camera technology. ADT is now expecting 2022 revenue of $6.200 billion to $6.400 billion, compared with a FactSet consensus of $5.694 billion. The company will host a virtual investor day later Tuesday to discuss its long-term financial plans. Shares have gained 6% in the last 12 months, while the S&amp;P 500 
        SPX,
        -0.24%
       has gained 12%. , Shares of EPAM Systems Inc. undefined tumbled 9.8% to pace all S&amp;P 500 undefined components in premarket losses, after the provider of digital platform engineering services said it was withdrawing its financial guidance as a result of "military actions" in Ukraine. The company had said in its fourth-quarter earnings report out Feb. 17 that it expected first-quarter revenue of $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion and 2022 revenue of at least $5.15 billion, which compared with the FactSet consensus at the end of January for first-quarter revenue of $1.11 billion and 2022 revenue of $4.87 billion. EPAM said in its 10-K annual report filing late Friday that its largest delivery centers were located in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. As of Dec. 31, it had 12,389 delivery professionals in Ukraine, 9,416 in Belarus and 8,933 in Russia. "EPAM's highest priority is the safety and security of its employees and their families in Ukraine. The company is proactively working to relocate its employees to lower risk locations in Ukraine and neighboring countries." The company stated on Monday. The stock, which tumbled 13.7% last week, is on track to open at the lowest price seen during regular-session hours since March 9, 2021. It has plunged 37.2% over the past three months through Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 slipped 4.6%.                                                                                                            , Ciara Linnane is MarketWatch's investing- and corporate-news editor.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Russian ruble crossed 105 per USD on Tuesday, slipping back towards Monday's record low of 122 as the substantial interest rate hike from the Central Bank of Russia was not enough to counterweight the raft of Western sanctions. Western allies largely limited Russian entities' ability to do business internationally after agreeing to remove key Russian banks from the SWIFT interbank system and freeze the assets of Russia’s central bank. The US also dealt another blow against Moscow by barring Americans from doing business with Russia’s central bank, ministry of finance and its sovereign wealth fund. This week, the CBR raised its key policy rate to 20% from 9.5%, commanded export-led businesses to sell 80% of their foreign currencies, and banned foreigners from selling Russian securities in an emergency move on Monday to limit further currency depreciation. At the same time, the central bank announced that RUB 1.8 trillion was withdrawn from Russian banks at the end of February. </td>

Meanwhile, a possible release of between 60 million and 70 million barrels of reserves being considered by the US and others failed to calm the energy market. Companies including BP and Shell also announced plans to exit Russian operations, while importers of Russian oil faced payment and delivery difficulties.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Peter Thiel-backed digital bank N26 plans to be ready for IPO by end of 2022 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , BARCELONA — German banking start-up N26 will be prepared for an initial public offering by the end of 2022, co-CEO Maximilian Tayenthal told CNBC.                                                                                    , "By the end of the year, N26 will be structurally IPO-ready," Tayenthal said in an interview Monday on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress technology conference.                                                              , Based out of Berlin, N26 offers fee-free checking accounts through an app, competing with established lenders in addition to rival fintech firms such as Revolut.                                                                     , Tayenthal founded the company in 2013 with longtime friend Valentin Stalf, and the two have since grown it into a $9 billion business.                                                                                                , N26 recently raised $900 million in fresh funding to help it branch out beyond retail banking into new areas like crypto and stock trading. It counts the likes of Coatue and billionaire PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel as investors. , N26's stock market debut could take place as early as 2024, Tayenthal said. However, he added the firm is in no rush to list.                                                                                                         , "We are not stressed to enter the public markets anytime soon," N26's boss said. "The private markets have proven to be incredibly liquid."                                                                                           , Global stock markets have seen seismic wobbles in recent months as traders navigate a plethora of uncertainties from the prospect of higher interest rates to the Ukraine-Russia conflict.                                            , Volatility in the market has spooked some companies into delaying or scrapping altogether any preparations to go public. In January, Dutch file-sharing service WeTransfer canceled its IPO plans due to "volatile market conditions.", N26 is evaluating its path toward becoming a publicly-listed company at a time when traders are getting worried about the potential for higher interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks.            , Higher rates are viewed as bad news for high-growth tech companies that tend to rely on debt financing to fuel rapid expansion.                                                                                                       , However, Tayenthal said N26 is not put off by the prospect of rate hikes. The start-up is a licensed bank, and in 2020 had around 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion) sitting on its balance sheet.                                      , "We are one of the companies that actually have a hedge on rising interest rates," Tayenthal said. "N26 is a liquidity-generating machine."                                                                                           , If rates were to rise dramatically, N26 wouldn't need to raise money through an IPO as the business would become "self-sustaining," the company's chief added.                                                                        , Banks typically benefit from rising interest rates, since they can generate a higher yield on cash deposits.                                                                                                                          , Still, N26 remains unprofitable.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures rose more than 6% toward $104 a barrel on Tuesday, a fresh high since 2014 as the possible release of strategic crude reserves by the US and its allies were not enough to offset concerns over Russian supply disruptions.  A release of between 60 million and 70 million barrels is being considered by the US and others, which would be equivalent to less than six days of Russian output. Companies including BP and Shell also announced plans to exit Russian operations, while importers of Russian oil faced payment and delivery difficulties. Meanwhile, OPEC+ will meet on Wednesday to discuss output policy, where it is expected to stick to its plan of moderate supply increases despite market turmoil brought by the invasion. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Indian 10Y Bond yield edged up to 6.77%, not far from its 2-½-year high of 6.89% hit on February 3rd as investors ran away from riskier assets amid ongoing Russia-Ukraine military conflicts and a consequent rally in crude oil prices. In India, the government announced a record borrowing plan of USD 200 billion from April while its central bank continued to maintain a more dovish than expected monetary policy in contrast to hawkish stances by the major global central banks including the Fed and BoE. With the RBI reassuring a delayed monetary policy normalization, it is unlikely to return to the pandemic-era measures of bond purchases. Last year, the RBI bought 2.2 trillion rupees of debt before stopping its bond-purchase program in October. Meanwhile, India’s economy expanded for the fifth straight quarter to 5.4% during September-December period of 2021, although it slowed from 8.5% recorded last quarter. </td>

The PBOC said total outstanding medium-term lending facilities (MLF) amounted to 4.85 trillion yuan. Still, losses were limited by the long-term bullish outlook that has arisen from the Ukraine crisis. analysts said Western sanctions against Moscow could support the Chinese currency in the long run as it may induce Russia to increase yuan holdings. Also, large foreign currency receipt holdings of onshore companies due to a trade surplus position in recent years left the yuan somewhat immune to external risk aversion. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Vladimir Putin: US intelligence agencies make understanding Russian President's state of mind a top priority - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Washington (CNN)The US intelligence community has made evaluating Russian President Vladimir Putin's state of mind a top priority in recent days as it seeks to establish how that is affecting his handling of the rapidly escalating Ukraine crisis, according to two sources familiar with the effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                , The efforts come as longtime Putin-watchers have publicly speculated that his behavior has become increasingly erratic and irrational. Since he launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine last Wednesday, senior US officials have asked intelligence agencies to gather any new information they can on how the Russian leader is faring and how his mindset has been impacted by the unexpectedly unified and tough response from European neighbors and allies around the world.                          , The US intelligence community has spent decades decoding the former KGB officer, who has effectively ruled Russia since 1999. But while the United States has tremendous institutional knowledge of the man, it has a notoriously poor view into his day-to-day decision-making. The Kremlin remains what intelligence officials call a "hard target" -- incredibly difficult to penetrate through traditional espionage.                                                                                , There has not been any new comprehensive assessment that indicates a particular change to Putin's overall health, said one US official. And officials have been on guard for the possibility that Putin's strategy may well be to project instability, in an attempt to push the US and allies to give him what he wants for fear that he could do worse.                                                                                                                                                , But the sudden burst of interest reflects a sense among some intelligence officials that Putin's decision-making in Ukraine has been out of character -- perhaps due to what some previous intelligence reports suggest has been protracted isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "Everything US has [is] in [the] realm of conjecture because Putin's decisions and statements don't seem to be making sense," said one source familiar with recent intelligence reporting on the topic. "For years, decades Putin has acted according to a pretty specific template."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In a classified briefing for lawmakers on Monday evening, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, said the US intelligence community does not have good insight into Putin's state of mind, according to a lawmaker who was present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who attended the Senate briefing, confirmed that Putin's state of mind had come up, but he declined to elaborate on what had been shared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , He did say, however, that regardless of the briefing, he personally is worried about Putin's mindset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Scores of raw intelligence reports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The intelligence community has produced scores of raw intelligence reports from sources as information pours in about the war. One such report that has circulated to more than a dozen agencies cites a source who has relayed that Putin's behavior has become "highly concerning and unpredictable" over just the last two days, according to a copy obtained by CNN.                                                                                                                                 , But in an indication of how difficult this information is to obtain directly, the description came secondhand to the FBI from a source who had talked to another, unknown source "with excellent access." The report notes that this person had in the past provided information that intelligence agencies were able to independently corroborate.                                                                                                                                                      , The source behind the report told the FBI that Putin "expressed extreme anger" over Western sanctions put in place in response to his attack on Ukraine and "felt that the sanctions had escalated the situation faster than he expected and beyond what he considered to be appropriate." Precisely which sanctions so infuriated Putin is unknown; that portion of the report is redacted.                                                                                                             , The report also notes that the circulation of accurate information about the war has been extremely limited within Russia, even at the highest levels of society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , For example, many people and well-connected individuals with the means to leave Russia before airports and borders were closed have remained in the country, according to the report -- suggesting that they had not known about the closures in advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The report, which originated from the FBI, comes with some caveats: It acknowledges that the source who provided the information to the FBI "may have provided the information to influence and inform" US decision-making -- in other words, that it might be an information operation designed to manipulate the United States.                                                                                                                                                                        , And officials caution that raw intelligence should not be taken as fact. It has not been evaluated for reliability or analyzed for its implications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But the report has nevertheless caused other agencies inside the Biden administration to ask the FBI to follow up with its source for additional information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA and the FBI declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A long history                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Speculation about Putin's mental health began after he gave a speech on Thursday laying out a warped, revisionist history that purported to justify his intervention in Ukraine. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, tweeted on Friday that Putin "has always been a killer, but his problem now is different &amp; significant" -- and suggested he was basing his assessment on intelligence briefings given to him as the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.                            , "I wish I could share more,but for now I can say it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin," Rubio wrote. "It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , For some, the boldness of Putin's decision to invade -- as well as his implied threat to use nuclear weapons -- is a break with the carefully calculated and far more limited military campaigns he has launched in the past. Video footage of the Russian President seated dozens of feet away from his senior military advisers during meetings and gleefully dressing down one of his spy chiefs on television have only underscored the image of an isolated leader, acting on his own counsel alone., By Sunday, the floodgates had opened. Former Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted that Putin had "changed," and sounded "completely disconnected from reality" and "unhinged." Former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper, who is a national security analyst at CNN, also called Putin "unhinged" and warned, "I worry about his acuity and balance."                                                                                                                                  , Other longtime Putin watchers argue that the Russian President's recent actions are relatively consistent with the man US intelligence has fixated on for decades, noting that he has long demonstrated a willingness to risk military defeat in operations that the United States thought offered no chance of success -- including ordering a second invasion of Chechnya in 1999, just three years after the Russian military had already been defeated there once.                                   , "This is not different than anything he's said before, he's just saying it all at once in a very stark way. And he's willing to do unspeakable things -- but he's always been willing to do unspeakable things," said Beth Sanner, a former briefer to then-President Donald Trump and a CNN national security analyst.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Putin isn't "insane or unhinged," Sanner said. Rather, she said, he is "highly emotional right now because of what he was about to embark upon ... and he has been very, very isolated, which adds to that emotional sense. But I don't think he's crazy."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , One US official echoed that assessment to CNN, arguing that Putin is acting in a way that he has long signaled he was capable of. Rather than a change in his mental acuity, this person said, officials believe he's simply become enraged -- making it impossible for his senior advisers to give him frank assessments.                                                                                                                                                                               , Even his command to put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert Sunday isn't unprecedented. In 2014, when Putin annexed Crimea, he also raised the possibility he might put his nuclear forces on high alert, which then as now raised the specter of nuclear weapons being introduced into the conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                        , Russia's nuclear doctrine, published in 2020, also includes a first-use nuclear policy. The Kremlin "reserves the right to use nuclear weapons," including "for the prevention of an escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions that are acceptable for the Russian Federation and/or its allies."                                                                                                                                                                               , Still, a source familiar with recent intelligence reporting on the topic said, it is "difficult to achieve conclusion of any confidence regarding Putin's state of mind.

Concerns over the Eurozone’s economic growth mounted due to higher prices of commodities and energy as Western nations announced hash sanctions on Russia. The Biden administration said that it would ban US people and companies from doing business with the Bank of Russia, the Russian National Wealth Fund, and the Ministry of Finance; after G7 nations agreed to exclude Russian banks from SWIFT. Money market futures dated to the ECB's meetings this year now price in a total of 25 basis points by year-end, from roughly 30 bps on Monday and 40bps late last week. </td>

Banks continued to trade in the red, led by UniCredit (-1.9%), due to the lender’s high exposure to the Russian market. Utilities also booked losses, after significant gains in the previous session, amid high volatility in the European energy market as countries pledge to move away from Russian dependency. On the data front, Italy’s consumer inflation for February accelerated to a 26-year high of 5.7%, above market expectations, while manufacturing PMI came slightly above expectations at 53.8. </td>

Earlier, Japan had joined Western allies in banning Russian financial institutions from the SWIFT global payments system and is now mulling to tackle Japanese established interests in Russia’s energy industries. Meanwhile, the Japanese government announced two nominees to replace outgoing policymakers in July, with analysts saying the board of the Bank of Japan will become less dovish with the changes. </td>

It was the third consecutive quarter of economic expansion, mainly attributed to increased output for hotels and restaurants,  manufacturing; transport, storage and communication; wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles; arts, entertainment and recreation; and other service activities. On a quarterly basis, the GDP increased 0.7 percent, slowing from an upwardly revised 1.7 percent growth in the third quarter. </td>

Disruptions to supplies from grain, energy and metals are adding to price pressures, at a time the Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates. Analysts feared that inflationary pressures could threaten growth prospects, which could cloud the outlook for monetary policy and increase hedging demand for gold. In addition, Russia intensified the shelling of Kharkiv and moved towards the capital Kyiv after cease-fire talks on Monday ended nowhere. In February, gold advanced about 6.5%, the month since May 2020, having soared to an 18-month high of $1,974/oz last week. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Poland Manufacturing PMI steadied to 54.7 in February of 2022 after a 54.5 reading in January, as expected, pointing to slightly faster growth in factory activity. Both output and new orders saw higher rates of expansion, with export orders rising the most since August 2021, underpinned by firmer domestic and foreign demand. Some reports pointed to capacity constraints that were behind another rise in employment, although health issues among staff offset some of the workforce gains. On the price front, input cost inflation eased to a 12-month low and output charges moderated to an 11-month low amid slower increases in average lead times. On the 12-month outlook, manufacturers were optimistic about sales, as pandemic-related issues were expected to fade, while planned new product releases and investment were also mentioned as output drivers. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The annual inflation rate in Italy likely accelerated to 5.7 percent in February of 2022 from 4.8 percent in the previous month and above market expectations of 5.3 percent, according to preliminary estimates. It was the highest reading since August of 1995, with main inflationary pressure coming from energy products (45.9 percent vs 38.6 percent in January), mainly those of the unregulated kind (31.3 percent vs 22.9 percent), while regulated energy accelerated to a lesser extent (94.6 percent vs 94.4 percent). Additional upward pressure should come from unprocessed food (6.9 percent vs 5.3 percent) and processed food (3.2 percent vs 2.2 percent). The annual core inflation rate, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, edged up to 1.7 percent from 1.5 percent. On a monthly basis, inflation was likely 0.9 percent, easing from the 1.6 percent increase in the previous year. </td>

Mr. Landrieu will be key to resolving those differences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , By Madeleine Ngo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , WASHINGTON — At a rare formal news conference in January, President Biden hailed the $1 trillion infrastructure package that Democrats and Republicans had recently approved, promising that miles of roads would be rebuilt, railways and bridges would be upgraded, and America’s public transit system would become a source of international envy.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , That same day, 16 Republican governors sent a letter to Mr. Biden that underscored the steep challenge he faces in turning his ambitions for the law into reality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The governors pushed back on federal attempts, outlined in a memo, to encourage states to use the funds to repair roads instead of expanding them, which the Biden administration said would exacerbate auto emissions. The letter urged the administration to refrain from using the law to push its “social agenda,” which they said would impede their own goals for the package, and to give them “maximum regulatory flexibility” in spending the funds.                                                                                           , Mr. Biden is expected to promote the law and commit to repairing 65,000 miles of roads and 1,500 bridges in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. He has spent the past several weeks traveling around the country to sell the package, which is central to his broader agenda of reducing emissions, promoting racial equity, creating jobs and providing relief to disadvantaged households. But much of its success rests with state leaders, who get to decide how to use much of the funds and who may not always share the president’s goals., At the center of that tension is Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who helped rebuild the city after Hurricane Katrina. As Mr. Biden’s infrastructure czar, Mr. Landrieu is responsible for ensuring that a signature piece of the president’s agenda is carried out along his terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , He has engaged in an outreach campaign with state and local leaders in an attempt to fulfill Mr. Biden’s vision, talking with nearly every governor and more than 55 mayors and touring the country to promote the law. On Feb. 16, Mr. Landrieu met with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss their goals for the funding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Some state leaders said their priorities aligned well with the federal government’s, such as repairing existing roadways, fixing decades-old bridges and expanding Amtrak service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “Broadly speaking, the bill’s goals and our goals are the same,” said Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut, a Democrat. “It’s about upgrading antique infrastructure that’s key to economic development. It is about fairness and equity.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But others, while accepting the money, have bristled at federal attempts to guide how it is spent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Gov. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, who signed the Jan. 19 letter, said states, particularly those outside the East Coast, needed the space to achieve their own priorities, such as constructing new highways. He also said the expansion of Amtrak service, a key goal of the Biden administration, was “not much of use” in Nebraska given its less dense population.                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Landrieu called Mr. Ricketts in November to discuss how the two sides could coordinate efforts. While the governor said he appreciated the call, he is not optimistic that the Biden administration will give states the flexibility they need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Outreach doesn’t matter if you’re going to restrict us,” Mr. Ricketts said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Republican lawmakers, several of whom voted with Democrats to pass the law, have sided with the states. Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia wrote their own letter to governors telling them to ignore the administration’s memo, which they said had “no effect of law.” On Feb. 18, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Capito and 27 other Republican senators sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg criticizing the memo.                                                                              , Mr. Landrieu, in an interview with The New York Times, said the letter from the governors did not surprise him. “There will always be a conflict in that zone,” he said about the tension between the federal government and states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Resolving that conflict will be a delicate balancing act. He acknowledged that governors would “have the ultimate decision” and that some communities, such as those with fewer roads and bridges to repair, would need more flexibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “In those instances, it makes perfect sense for them to do that. In other states, it doesn’t.” Mr. Landrieu said. “There’s got to be flexibility in there, and we recognize that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , But he made clear that the Biden administration would continue to try to influence the types of projects the funds went toward, including by issuing federal guidance and recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “The federal government does have the power to set what they call guidance and rules and regulations,” Mr. Landrieu said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , So far, some states have shown a willingness to defy — and challenge — those rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican whose state recently sued the Biden administration over efforts to recoup stimulus funds, said his office was not afraid to push back if he believed federal guidance was too overreaching. Mr. Ducey said widening highways was one of his top priorities for the rapidly growing state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “We don’t need additional guidance from the federal government,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Most of the money has yet to flow, with just nearly $100 billion allocated to state and local governments and the bulk of funding expected to be released over the next two to three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , That poses another challenge for Mr. Landrieu. It could be years before many of these projects are complete, making it harder for Mr. Biden to highlight the law’s impact in the midterm elections and ahead of his re-election campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr. Landrieu said he had faced a similar dilemma while in office, pointing to the construction of the new Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport terminal. That $1 billion project, which he pushed and secured funding for, was completed after his tenure, although he was not up for re-election. Mr. Landrieu said that Mr. Biden would continue to promote the package, but that he did not think the president had to stand beside completed projects for Americans to understand his contribution.                                    , “Getting credit is really not that important. I mean, what you’re doing here is something that’s going to last for generations, we hope,” Mr. Landrieu said. “So we want to go fast, but we want to get it right.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Mr. Landrieu, who gained national recognition for removing four Confederate monuments in New Orleans, said he would also prioritize addressing racial inequities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “I can’t offer anything to the African American community about their experience,” Mr. Landrieu said. “I can offer my view of being a white man from the South that grew up during one of the most difficult racial times and the way that white people here have a difficult time dealing with the issue of race in a way that allows us to recognize our past.”                                                                                                                                                                                       , His allies described him as a detail-oriented and effective leader who knew how to cut through federal bureaucracy. He built a reputation as the person who turned New Orleans around after it was run by C. Ray Nagin, who was later imprisoned for bribery and fraud. But he faced a mixed record over some of his infrastructure work, including his handling of the city’s Sewerage and Water Board. He was also known as an aggressive leader who pressed forward with his decisions, a style that rankled some of his critics.                    , The bill receives final approval. The House passed the $1 trillion bill on Nov. 5 to rebuild the country’s aging public works system. The proposal is a central plank of President Biden’s economic agenda, which he signed into law on Nov. 15. Here’s what’s inside the bill:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Transportation. The proposal would see tens of billions of dollars in new federal spending going to roads, bridges and transportation programs. Amtrak would see its biggest infusion of money since its inception, and funds would be allocated to programs intended to provide safe commutes for pedestrians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Climate. Funding would be provided to better prepare the country to face global warming. The Forest Service would get billions of dollars to reduce the effects of wildfires. The bill includes $73 billion to modernize the nation’s electricity grid to allow it to carry renewable energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Resources for underserved communities. A new $2 billion grant program is expected to expand transportation projects in rural areas. The bill would also increase support for Native American communities, allotting $216 million to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for climate-resilience and adaptation efforts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Internet access. The bill includes $65 billion meant to connect hard-to-reach rural communities and low-income city dwellers to high-speed internet. Other provisions seek to stoke competition and transparency among service providers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Some said Mr. Landrieu’s experience leading New Orleans made him equipped for his current job. The city, with its pothole-filled streets, century-old pipes and persistent flooding problems, embodies some of the nation’s most dire infrastructure deficiencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Cedric Richmond, one of Mr. Biden’s closest advisers and a former congressman who represented most of New Orleans for a decade, said Mr. Landrieu had a record of making tough decisions to “get stuff done,” pointing to the new airport terminal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Paul Rainwater, who served as the interim executive director of the Sewerage and Water Board, said Mr. Landrieu “will not just take an answer.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “He wants to know the how and the why,” Mr. Rainwater said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Mr. Rainwater was responsible for turning the Sewerage and Water Board around after a severe thunderstorm overwhelmed the city’s pumping and drainage network, flooding hundreds of cars and properties. After the 2017 floods, Mr. Landrieu demanded the resignations of some agency officials, who initially claimed the system was working properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The situation prompted criticism from people like Aaron Mischler, the president of the New Orleans Fire Fighters Association, who said Mr. Landrieu had failed to improve the agency and oversee its leadership during his eight years in office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “Those issues still remain,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Some who worked with Mr. Landrieu described him as an aggressive leader. Rosalind Cook, a co-president of the League of Women Voters of New Orleans, said the group had met with Mr. Landrieu during his second term as mayor to discuss moving the upcoming early winter election to the fall, when voters would be less distracted by the holidays and sporting events.                                                                                                                                                                               , According to Ms. Cook, Mr. Landrieu adamantly opposed the proposal, which could have cut his tenure short, and said the change should wait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “If he had a conflicting view, he was much more of a bully behind closed doors,” said Ms. Cook, a Tulane University political science instructor. The change was later made, but the inauguration date did not change, resulting in a longer transition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Others said Mr. Landrieu’s strong personality was an asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “Sometimes people are not always thrilled with a leader moving as decisively as Mitch has been required to do over time,” said Walt Leger, a former Louisiana state representative. “But I’ve never seen that result in a negative for the community.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Advertisement </td>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Since a short video of the woman chained in a doorless shack went viral in late January, the Chinese public has taken the matter into its own hands to find out who she is, whether she is a victim of human trafficking and why the apparently mentally ill woman had eight children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The public thought it couldn’t trust a government that was not truthful about her identity and that was acquiescent when it came to forced marriages involving human trafficking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , On Chinese social media, users dug up a marriage certificate with a photo of a woman who was identified by the government as the chained woman but looked different from her. They dived into court documents that showed the region where she lived has a dark history of human trafficking. Long-retired investigative journalists traveled to a village deep in the mountains, knocking on each door, to verify the government’s claim that she grew up there.                                                                                                                                                     , “No social events have ever had the same effect on netizens like the one of the chained woman,” a user called “Xudiqiuziyuanku” wrote on the social media platform WeChat. “It forced us to become detectives, analysts, A.I. image in-painting technicians, data mining engineers and Sherlock Holmes.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Chinese public staged a rare online revolt because it felt that the government had failed to prioritize the personal safety of women, despite its claims that women “hold up half of the sky.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , It’s one of the biggest credibility challenges Beijing has faced in recent years. The chained woman became a symbol of injustice that brought together liberals as well as nationalistic digital warriors and apolitical moderates. Many of them are worried that the chain on her neck, in a literal and figurative sense, could fall on them or their loved ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The video of the chained woman has led to a kind of #MeToo movement on the Chinese internet, in which many people stepped forward to share stories of mothers, daughters, sisters and classmates who were abducted or simply disappeared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “We’re not bystanders, but survivors,” goes a popular social media quip. “We’re not rescuing the chained woman. Instead, she’s rescuing us.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The top three hashtags about the chained woman on the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo have accumulated more than 10 billion views, rivaling those about the Beijing Winter Olympics, which were heavily promoted by Weibo and official media outlets. And the topic continues to hold people’s attention online amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Even some of Beijing’s most devoted supporters expressed their sympathy toward the woman. They’re also worried that the poorly managed crisis could challenge the government’s authority. “Politically this is tragic,” Hu Xijin, the retired editor in chief of the official Global Times, wrote in February. “It’s a clear warning that the government’s credibility has been weakened significantly.”                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The outpouring resembles the one in 2020 over the death of a Chinese doctor who was reprimanded by the police for sharing his knowledge about the coronavirus outbreak. In this highly censored society, it’s rare for ordinary Chinese to express critical views of the government. Many people are willing to speak up because they feel vulnerable — and guilty for not being aware of the problems already.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “If justice cannot be served in this case,” Zhao Jianfeng, an internet entrepreneur in Hangzhou, wrote on his WeChat timeline, “this place will fall into a very long and very dark night.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “I felt that if this case isn’t resolved,” wrote a science writer with the Weibo handle @Luka, “happiness will be superficial and many things will be meaningless.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Hundreds of graduates from some of China’s most prominent universities signed petitions, urging the central government to investigate the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Several bookstores set up sections for books that could help readers understand the case, including “Masculine Domination” by Pierre Bourdieu, “Men Explain Things to Me” by Rebecca Solnit and “Jane Doe January: My Twenty-Year Search for Truth and Justice” by Emily Winslow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Lawyers, academics, former journalists and many bloggers helped give the Chinese public a crash course on human trafficking, forced marriage and demographic statistics. They resurfaced books, films, documentaries and news reports about abducted women.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The public learned that China’s legal system was set up to protect the men who paid for abducted women. Buying a woman could subject someone to up to three years of jail time, a prominent legal scholar said in a viral video, the same as the sentence for buying 20 frogs. When victims of human trafficking filed for divorce, the courts often ruled against them, saying that having stayed with the men sufficed as evidence of a good marriage.                                                                                                                                                              , They learned how easily women, even well-educated ones, could become victims of human trafficking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Some of the unearthed stories, based on official media reports and court documents, hit home for the Chinese middle class: A graduate student from Shanghai was abducted on a field trip and sold to a hunched man. She was rescued after 71 days. A 13-year-old girl in Beijing was kidnapped on her way to school and sold to a man who constantly beat her up. She had a son at 15 and couldn’t escape until she turned 19. A young woman from Hangzhou was abducted on a business trip and spent the next two decades in a remote village. She was rescued after her son went to college and informed her parents., But a vast majority of human trafficking victims came from the poorest corners in China. Few were rescued. It was nearly impossible for the women to escape because whole villages kept an eye on them. They would be beaten and locked up after being caught.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Court documents showed selling and reselling mentally ill women was common in some parts of China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , A 2020 verdict showed that a woman with schizophrenia in Hubei Province was sold three times in less than two years. A 2017 verdict showed that a woman with mental illness was sold to a man in Shandong Province and was beaten to death by him and his mother.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The more people learned about what victims of human trafficking had gone through, the more furious they felt about the government’s conflicting statements about the chained woman. They wanted to know who she was, how the government would prosecute the people responsible for her miserable conditions and what it would do to help many other women like her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The chained woman, who is 44, has led a tragic life, according to a statement the Jiangsu provincial government issued Feb. 23, the fifth since late January.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Named Xiaohuamei (little flower plum), she grew up in a remote village in a southwestern province, Yunnan. She showed signs of mental illness after she was divorced at 20. In 1998, a couple smuggled her to eastern Jiangsu Province. She was sold twice within a year, the second time to the family of a man named Dong Zhimin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , She and Mr. Dong had a son in 1999, the statement said. Then between 2011 and 2020, she gave birth to seven other children. After she had the third child, her mental illness deteriorated. Since 2017, Mr. Dong had bound her with ropes or chained her neck when she was ill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Xiaohuamei was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was hospitalized, the statement said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Dong has been charged on suspicion of abusing a family member. The couple who smuggled her were charged with human trafficking, and 17 low-level local officials were disciplined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , But many people remain skeptical or have reservations about the statement. It was hard to trust it, they said, because there was only one source of information — the government — and journalists from relatively independent outlets were barred from investigating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , They were disappointed that Mr. Dong was charged only with abuse, instead of rape and false imprisonment, and that the woman was denied the opportunity to speak for herself. They took issue with many facts the government presented, and many still want to know how and when the woman was married and especially whether she’s the woman in the marriage certificate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The government said Xiaohuamei didn’t resemble the woman in the marriage certificate because she was now older and had lost most of her teeth. But some social media users were doubtful. The changes seemed too drastic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The public is most disappointed with the government’s lack of a serious plan to eradicate human trafficking and forced marriage. Instead, it seems to be more interested in taking back control of the narrative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Two women who tried to visit the chained woman were detained and beaten by local police officers in February. Their posts and social media accounts were deleted. Some social media users who shared their posts said they had gotten calls from the police.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The bookstores were told to take down their special sections. Professors were warned not to discuss Xiaohuamei’s case with their students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The government didn’t seem to care whether it was being truthful or not, many people said online. Government officials were promoting the version of truth they wanted the public to believe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Some social media users shared a short video of compiled footage of Hollywood movies with different characters saying, “I don’t buy it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Liu Yi contributed research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Ibex 35 Index traded over dropped 1% to hover below the 8,400 level on Tuesday, in line with its European counterparts, as investors continued to monitor the developments of the Russian invasion in major Ukrainian cities and assess the consequences that sanctions against Russia may bring to the European economy. Energy shares led the losses, after booking significant gains in the last session as investors bet on a future with higher European energy production with EU states assessing a transition into less dependence on Russian energy. Also, banks continue to trade in the red as the EU removes key Russian lenders from the Swift global system, driven by Banco Santander (-1.9%) and BBVA (-1%). </td>

Western leaders hope the unprecedented measures will bring about a change in thinking in the Kremlin.             , Ordinary Russians face seeing their savings wiped out. Their lives are already being disrupted.                                                                                                                                                             , The sanctions against some Russian banks include cutting them off from Visa and Mastercard, and consequently Apple Pay and Google Pay.                                                                                                                      , Daria, 35, a project manager in Moscow, said this meant he'd been unable to use the metro.                                                                                                                                                                  , "I always pay with my phone but it simply didn't work. There were some other people with the same problem. It turned out that the barriers are operated by VTB bank which is under sanctions and cannot accept Google Pay and Apple Pay.                    , "I had to buy a metro card instead," he told the BBC. "I also couldn't pay in a shop today - for the same reason."                                                                                                                                          , On Monday Russia more than doubled its interest rate to 20% in response to the sanctions after the rouble plunged to record new lows. The stock market remains closed amid fears of a massive share sell-off.                                               , The Kremlin says it has enough resources to weather the sanctions, but this is debatable.                                                                                                                                                                   , Over the weekend the central bank appealed for calm amid fears of a run on the banks, which happens when too many people try to withdraw money.                                                                                                             , "There are no dollars, no roubles - nothing! Well, there are roubles but I am not interested in them," said Anton (name changed), who is in his late 20s and was queuing at an ATM in Moscow.                                                               , "I don't know what to do next.

But the war has helped set new records - at one point on Monday a dollar cost 113 roubles and a euro, 127.                                                                  ,  For Russians, the rouble-dollar rate has long been a sensitive issue.                                                                                                                                                                                      ,  In the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the dollar was the only hard currency Russians kept their savings in - the safest bet was under the mattress.                                                                                     , When President Boris Yeltsin's government defaulted on its debt in 1998 those who'd been sleeping on their money felt vindicated.                                                                                                                           , However, over the following decade various central bank measures helped reassure Russians about the rouble. Deposits placed in Russian currency began to grow and so did the amount of money Russians invest in the stocks of Russian companies.            , Nevertheless, any time there's uncertainty Russians always run to the nearest ATM to withdraw dollars.                                                                                                                                                      , This time has been no different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , As soon as war was unleashed on Ukraine last week, Russians flocked to cashpoints, remembering lessons learnt in previous crises.                                                                                                                           , Ilya (name changed), who is in his early 30s, has just finished paying off his mortgage in Moscow. He says he is unable to relocate "any time soon".                                                                                                        , "When the operation in Donbas started I went to the ATM and withdrew the savings I had in Sberbank in dollars.

If things get worse, I'll withdraw the lot. I am scared because I expect a wave of burglaries. But it is what it is."                                              , Images on social media have shown long queues forming at ATMs and money exchanges around the country in recent days, with people worried their bank cards may stop working or that limits will be placed on the amount of cash they can withdraw.           , Dollars and euros began running out within a couple of hours of the invasion. Since then, very limited amounts of those currencies have been available and there is a cap on how many roubles you can withdraw.                                             , Standing at one queue in Moscow, Evgeny (name changed), 45, said he wanted to withdraw money to pay off his mortgage.                                                                                                                                       , "Everyone I know is anxious.

As well as their savings falling in value, many Russians are predicted to lose their jobs as the economy reels from being cut off from financial markets in the West., For Russians this all brings back memories of what happened when President Putin annexed Crimea in 2014 and people queued for hours to get cash.                                                                                                            , Currency offices had to hastily buy new five-digit exchange rate boards when the old ones ran out of space.                                                                                                                                                 , Back then a dollar normally cost 30-35 roubles - an unthinkable amount these days.                                                                                                                                                                          , Additional reporting by  Amalia Zatari, BBC Russian in Moscow                                                                                                                                                                                               , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Watch the final series of Killing Eve on BBC iPlayer                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A journey to understand the impact alcohol addiction has on young women in Northern Ireland                                                                                                                                                                 , The unlikely Olympian talks to Colin Murray about how fear gives him focus                                                                                                                                                                                  , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield fell to 1.8% on Tuesday, the lowest in near four weeks as demand for safe-haven assets surged after the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces continued and Western nations ramped up new sanctions on Russia in response. In the latest development, Russia intensified the shelling of Kharkiv and moved towards the capital Kyiv after cease-fire talks on Monday ended nowhere. As a result, investors continue to scale back aggressive rate hike bets across major developed economies. </td>

Also, the number of approvals exceeded market expectations of 72 thousand. Approvals for remortgaging, which only capture remortgaging with a different lender, rose to 46.2 thousand in January. This remains below to the 12-month average up to February 2020 of 49.5 thousand, but is the highest since February 2020 (52.3 thousand). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK Manufacturing PMI Revised Higher </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI inched up to a 3-month high of 58 in February of 2022, up from a 4-month low of 57.3 expected in preliminary figures and recorded in January. Domestic demand, fewer raw material shortages, and easing global supply chain issues allowed for production to rise at the highest pace in 7 months. Also, gains in new customers, looser COVID-19 rules, and improved market conditions augured well for new work intakes, which contrasted with falling orders from abroad. Manufacturers added new workers for the 14th month running, which helped reduce backlogs of work for the first time in 16 months. Despite a peak in supplier lead times, firms continued to expand their raw material inventories and input purchasing volumes rose. On the price front, input and output price inflation rates remained near record levels. Looking at the year ahead, nearly two thirds of respondents were upbeat about production, taking the overall degree of optimism to a 6-month high. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Norway’s DNB Manufacturing PMI fell to 55.9 in February of 2022 from 56.3 in the previous month. The latest reading points to the smallest gain in manufacturing activity since January of 2021, driven by a decrease in new orders (52.5 vs 53.3 in January). At the same time, supplier’s delivery time shortened (73.6 vs 76.9) and inventory of purchased goods rose (62 vs 57.3), generally indicating lower activity. In the current situation, it could also reflect disturbances on the supply side and transportation problems. Meanwhile, increases were observed in indices of production (54.5 vs 52.7) and employment (58.1 vs 56.5). On the price front, input prices slowed (78.9 vs 81.4). </td>

Engie (-6.7%) and TotalEnergies (-0.2%) both booked losses after French Economic Minister Bruno Le Maire said he would hold talks with both firms regarding their ties to Russia, as France attempts to move away from Russian energy sources.

The net increase was split between GBP 0.1 billion of additional borrowing on credit cards, and GBP 0.5 billion in borrowing in other forms of consumer credit (such as car dealership finance and personal loans). The annual growth rate for all consumer credit increased to 3.2% in January from 1.5% in December.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Major European stock indices pulled back on Tuesday after showing slight gains in early trading, with both the German DAX and the pan-European Stoxx 600 below the flatline, as investors monitored earnings, the Ukraine crisis and sanctions against Russia. Satellite imagery showed a long Russian armored convoy was headed towards Kyiv, as cease-fire talks on Monday ended nowhere. Mining and energy stocks were higher as fears of supply disruptions boosted commodity prices but gains were offset by losses in the travel &amp; leisure sector. On the earnings front, German pharma group Bayer posted Q4 net income of €1.17B, compared to €0.31B a year earlier, resulting in EPS €1.18, up from €0.32 last year, and expects 2022 sales to increase by 5% on a FX adjusted basis.

Driving this result was the suppliers’ delivery times gauge (which is inverted in the calculation of the headline PMI), as the respective index recorded a notable increase since January. Partly offsetting this were the largest-weighted sub-components of the PMI – output and new orders – which experienced slightly positive directional changes. Employment growth was meanwhile stable, and stocks of purchases increased a slightly weaker pace. Latest survey data continued to highlight strong pricing power among price setters, with steep rates of both input cost and output price inflation persisting. In both cases the increases were among the steepest on record, although they did slow since January. </td>

Still, data pointed to the 20th consecutive month of growth in factory activity. The sustained expansion was driven by higher output and new work, with respondents citing strong client demand as the reason for increased factory production. At the same time, order book volumes expanded for the 15th month in a row, although at the slowest pace, carried by inflows of new work from foreign markets. On the other hand, data pointed to a sustained deterioration in vendor performance, while issues in sourcing materials continued to pressure capacity. In response, employment in Italian factories continued to grow. Also, elevated supply chain issues lifted material and energy costs, but the rate of inflation was the slowest in 11 months. Looking forward, strong demand conditions lifted business confidence to five month highs. </td>

Growth of output remained strong but was constrained somewhat by a temporary decline in staff availability owing to COVID-related absences. New orders growth accelerated for the second month in a row to the highest since last August and new export orders rose to the greatest extent for six months amid reports of sales growth across the US, Italy and other parts of southern Europe. On the price front, the rate of increase in input prices was at an 11-month low; and average prices charged by goods producers continued to rise sharply. Materials, particularly metals and plastics, energy and transportation were cited by surveyed businesses as sources of cost pressure.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit France Manufacturing PMI rose to 57.2 in Februar of 2022 from a three-month low of 55.5 in January but slightly below preliminary figures of 57.6. Production rose at the strongest pace since last July, with broad gains across sectors, and orders were higher than in January, reflecting the highest monthly increase in new work in 7 months. Orders from abroad were also higher, with firms mentioning European and Chinese clients as their main markets. On the capacity side, outstanding work increased at a pace not seen in 8 months, while employment rose to offset the temporary lack of workers due to sick leave, producers said. Supplier delivery times lengthened at the slowest pace since March of 2021, and both input and output charges rose slightly less in February. Looking at the year ahead, goods producers expected further gains in workloads to result in higher output levels. </td>

Nor did it start in 2014. It began a decade and a half ago when Russia invaded Georgia and got away with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "Remember the red button?" a friend texted when the first Russian bombs fell on Kyiv. In the region that has been colonized and tormented by Russia for centuries, everyone remembers the red "reset" button: the gift of an illusory fresh start that Hillary Clinton presented to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during their meeting in Geneva 2009.                                                                                                                        , By then, the invasion of Georgia's capital Tbilisi had been averted, but with 20% of its territory occupied by Russia, the country's sovereignty was dangerously crippled. The Georgian government, America's closest non-NATO ally in the region, was warning about a new, hybrid war. But after all the trauma of Bush's foreign adventures, the United States was eager to move on.                                                                                                     , As Clinton presented Lavrov with a red button, global headlines focused on the amusing fact that Americans had managed to misspell "reset" in Russian and that it made Lavrov laugh. But the region gasped for air: everyone who has experienced Russian oppression knew that what really pleased Lavrov was that Moscow got away with murder.                                                                                                                                             , Over the next 14 years, it would happen again and again. Many of us, including me, didn't think Putin would launch an invasion of this scale against Ukraine. Millions of us -- Ukrainians, Moldovans, Georgians, Syrians, Armenians and Azeris -- have all participated in dress rehearsals for the horror show that the Kremlin has now unleashed. And we know that it did not have to come to this.                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The playbook Putin has been using to rebuild his empire was always rudimentary. The supposed antagonists were always an oppressed population and a "fascist" government backed by the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But with each rehearsal Putin tweaked the play. In Georgia in 2008, Putin's soldiers had dirty boots and rusty tanks, but he first tested his now infamous cyber attacks. He got away with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , By the time Russian troops arrived in Crimea six years later, they had shiny new boots and new uniforms modeled on US special forces. And Putin, fresh after his Olympics triumph in Sochi, was more confident than ever. He lied at a scale we had never seen before, telling the world that Russian soldiers were not Russian soldiers , and then he annexed Crimea. He got away with it.                                                                                                , Then came Donbas and Syria, interference in the US elections, the Salisbury killings and the Navalny poisoning. And each time he got away with murder, we met a new Putin -- more brutal at home and more audacious abroad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The United States and Europe spent millions countering Russian disinformation. But debunking his propaganda was not enough to counter the narratives Putin had pushed using powerful, multi-million dollar media networks that he kept building, at home and abroad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , This network, which included big names like RT and Sputnik, but also hundreds of small websites and social media channels, tapped masterfully into existing fears and legitimate grievances of each audience they addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , America's 2003 invasion of Iraq and the disaster that followed was a gift Putin used to turn any debate into another round of exhausting whataboutery, which in turn made Putin a hero for the European far-left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , He turned LGBTQ+ rights into a frontline of his domestic attack on the West, telling traditional Russians and their neighbors that their families and their values were under threat. It worked. "I am fighting because I do not want to be forced to marry a man," a pro-Russian fighter in Ukraine told me in 2014.                                                                                                                                                                      , Eventually this family values narrative caught up in the West, turning Putin into an unexpected hero for the far right. Authoritarian populists all around the world were suddenly reaching out for help: Kremlin-funded Sputnik was training state media workers from Georgia to the Philippines and India and by 2020, Brazilian president Bolsonaro was repeating a myth about a supposed Western plot to legalize paedophilia that I first heard on the Russian state TV back in 2012. ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But what made Putin truly powerful was not the narratives he molded or territories that he grabbed. It was the complacent, stubborn refusal of the collective West to accept that he was at war with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , For years, Western media portrayed Ukraine as a country "at war with itself." But it never was. It was bewildering to me that after all these years, even before this latest, and possibly fatal for him, invasion, the debate in the West focused on rights and wrongs of the NATO enlargement and not the fact that a sovereign country has the right to choose its own path.                                                                                                            , "What will it take for them to wake up?" one Ukrainian soldier asked me, when I interviewed him as a journalist about Georgia's and Ukraine's shared ordeal in 2015. Now we know the answer, but back then, as we sat in a cold, wet trench on the frontline of Ukraine's war we could not find it.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The soldier, Dima, was like every Ukrainian you now see on your screen: stoic, determined, calm. He was 23, a software engineer from Kyiv who had only recently decided to leave his job and join the fight. His girlfriend was furious with him, he told me, but fighting was not optional.                                                                                                                                                                                               , "They think we are fighting to join NATO. But we are only fighting for our values and they happen to be the same as Europe's values. We are fighting for them too. I wish they realized it," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , They do now. The whole world is suddenly high on moral clarity. For everyone who has lived on the frontlines of Putin's hatred for liberal democracy, this show of Western unity and the resurgence of liberal values comes as an incredible relief.  But it won't last unless we also accept that it already comes too late for far too many.                                                                                                                                             , It is too late for Georgians who never stopped losing lives and land, for countless residents of Aleppo who died in the Russian bombardment, for 298 men, women and children who fell from the sky when a civilian Boeing MH17 was shot down by a Russian BUK missile in 2015, for thousands who died in the Donbas in the last 8 years and for countless others who are yet to die in Ukraine.                                                                                            , It is too late for Dima, who was killed in eastern Ukraine in fighting a year after we spoke and long before Europeans finally recognized that it was them he was fighting for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , His question why it took the West so long to wake up is still being asked by millions of people who live on frontlines of Putin's hatred for liberal democracy all around the world. It is the question that should inform whatever the West does with the new world order that will hatch out of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                             , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The procure.ch and Credit Suisse Manufacturing PMI for Switzerland edged down to 62.6 on February of 2022 from 63.8 in the prior month, missing market expectations of 64. Even though the reading comfortably remained above the 50 threshold, it was the slowest rate of expansion in 12 months. Decreases were seen for production (-0.7 to 57.9), orderbooks (-1.2 to 61.7), purchasing volume (-2.2 to 56.8), stocks purchased (-3.2 to 57.5), and delivery times (-3.2 to 74.9).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI fell to a four-month low of 56.5 in February of 2022 from 59.0 in the previous month, missing market consensus of 58.5. Still, the latest reading signalled strong performance in the Czech manufacturing sector for the second straight month of 2022. Output and new orders continued to expand sharply, albeit with growth rates coming down from January’s recent highs. As a result, the rate of job creation also softened. On the price front, rising energy prices and input shortages continued to drive costs higher, but pace of inflation was at one year-low. Consequently, output charges eased to an eight-month low. Finally, business optimism picked up to 46-month high driven by robust increase in demand. </td>

Washington targeted Russia's central bank, effectively prohibiting Americans from doing any business with the bank as well as freezing its assets within the U.S.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , That comes on top of sanctions that have targeted oligarchs and Russia's sovereign debt as well as moves aimed at cutting the country off from the global financial system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Debate has been raging over whether bitcoin, which is not owned or issued by a single authority like a central bank, could be used by Russia to evade sanctions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Veteran investor Mark Mobius said that could be one reason behind bitcoin's rise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "I would say that's the reason why bitcoin has shown strength now — because the Russians have a way of getting money out, getting their wealth out," Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners, told CNBC on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But the amount of money that Russia would need to convert to and from bitcoin might be too much, according to Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "You're going to see Russia attempt to circumvent the U.S. financial system by turning to crypto. I think the issue is … the liquidity just simply isn't there," Redbord told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But cryptocurrency could also be a way for regular Russians and even Ukrainian citizens to get their money out of their respective countries as their currencies remain volatile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Bitcoin traded at a 6% premium on Binance exchange's Ukrainian hryvnia market, according a note published by cryptocurrency research firm Kaiko on Monday.

But bitcoin has not performed that way. Instead, it has been more correlated to the movement of stock prices, even as inflation continues to hit multi-year highs and a military conflict plays out. That case for bitcoin as digital gold has unraveled in recent weeks., Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, said that could be changing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are arguably having their watershed moment against backdrop of global uncertainty and tension related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis," Ayyar told CNBC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Crypto is decoupling from traditional markets and can be clearly seen in the performance."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , People have been donating cryptocurrency to the Ukrainian army too, "proving that crypto is fundamentally a technology that cannot be ignored," Ayyar added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , He also said that a bottom for bitcoin was already forming as the war was getting underway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Michael Rinko, venture associate at AscendEx, told CNBC on Monday that $38,000 was a key level for bitcoin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "More people bought at $38,000 than at any other level above or below for a good margin," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , However, Bitbank's Hasegawa warned of further volatility ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "There still are a lot ... of potential risks up ahead for the market, like the Russia—Ukraine negotiation falling apart, even more huge air strikes on Ukrainian cities, nuclear threats, and U.S. jobs report on Friday, so it looks like the next couple of days are going to be a wild ride for bitcoin," Hasegawa said.                                                                                                                                                            , — CNBC's Tanaya Macheel contributed to this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 traded slightly higher on Tuesday, in a mixed session for European bourses, as investors digested earnings against a worrying Ukraine crisis in the background. Satellite imagery showed a long Russian armored convoy was headed towards Kyiv, in what looked to be an effort by Russia to seize the capital. In corporate updates, British specialty chemical maker Croda posted a 48% surge in annual profits, boosted by a rebound in the cosmetics unit and its life sciences division. Meanwhile, Astrazeneca said it agreed to develop a therapy for a rare condition that leads to heart failure in a deal with Swiss Neurimmune valued up to $760M. Finally, Shell has followed BP’s footsteps and announced plans to exit its Russian operations, including the Sakhalin 2 LNG project, which could lead to billions in impairments. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sweden Manufacturing PMI at 17-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Swedbank Manufacturing PMI for Sweden decreased to a 17-month low of 58.6 in February of 2022 from a downwardly revised 62.2 in January, but remaining above the long-run average of 54.8.  The largest negative contribution came from order intake, followed by delivery times, production and inventory. Meanwhile, employment rose and delivery times declined for the fifth month in a row. On the price front, price increases from the supplier level are still widespread, even though the index for suppliers' raw materials and intermediate goods prices fell in February for the fourth month in a row to 83.0. "The downward trend in the purchasing managers' index strengthens the picture of a cooling Swedish industrial economy. At the same time, the industry is being challenged by increased geopolitical uncertainty with the Russian invasion of Ukraine with the risk of negative effects on growth and on companies' production plans", said Jorgen Kennemar, responsible for the PMI analysis. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European Stocks Mixed on Tuesday </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Major European stock indices traded mixed on Tuesday, with the German DAX down by less than 1% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 almost flat, as investors continued to assess the Ukraine crisis and sanctions against Russia. Satellite imagery showed a long Russian armored convoy was headed towards Kyiv, and additional military activity in Belarus, near Ukraine’s northern border, after speculation that the country would help with Russia’s invasion. Healthcare stocks outperformed after upbeat earnings from Bayer. The German pharma group posted Q4 net income of €1.17B, compared to €0.31B a year earlier, resulting in EPS €1.18, up from €0.32 last year, and expects 2022 sales to increase by 5% on a FX adjusted basis. Other earnings in Germany came from Covestro, HelloFresh, and Zalando. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Spain Factory Activity Gains Momentum </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Spain Manufacturing PMI rose to a three-month high of 56.9 in February of 2022 from 56.2 in the previous month, above market forecasts of 56, pointing to improving operating conditions for 13 months in a row. Output rose the most in five months, linked to higher new orders and efforts to keep on top of workloads. There were signs of better market demand and activity, both at home and abroad. At the same time, the rate of job creation was marked and hit its highest level since last August. On the price front, inflationary pressures remained strong as delays in the delivery of inputs persisted. Also exacerbating inflationary pressures was the continued purchasing of goods by manufacturers as they sought to build-up safety stocks to avoid shortages and expected price rises. Looking ahead to the coming 12 months, firms remained optimistic, with business sentiment at its highest level in over four years. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Czech Republic's gross domestic product advanced 0.9 percent on quarter in the three months ending December of 2021, following a 1.6 percent increase in the previous period and matching preliminary estimates. The positive GDP development was supported mainly by increasing external demand as exports rose more (+2.2%) than imports (-0.4%);  and expenditure on the fixed capital formation (+0.5%). Meanwhile, final consumption expenditure of households decreased by 1.8%. On a yearly basis, the economy expanded by 3.6 percent, above a downwardly revised estimate of a 3.5 percent rise. Considering the full 2021, the GDP increased 3.3 percent. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK Natural Gas Follows EU Prices Higher </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK natural gas prices extended gains to 250 pence a therm, tracking Dutch TTF futures higher, driven by uncertainty over Russian supplies to Europe. Caution remained high as EU energy ministers gathered in an emergency meeting to discuss possible retaliatory measures by Russia, which could mean a halt in natural gas flows to Europe, after Western nations and some allies blocked Russian institutions from the SWIFT global payments system. Although Russia has said it will keep exporting natural gas, around one third of Europe’s imports of the commodity pass through Ukraine, where the conflict could cause damage to vital pipelines. </td>

One of the best feelings in the world, since I’m in control of that happening then why not stay let it stay that way. I’ve been through the emotions can come from holding for weeks waiting for you move to happen - to the upside or downside since 2016 when I started trading crypto it’s March 2022 now that’s over with. With the indices you don’t have to wait they are volatile every day, my goal is not be a day trader trying to run up thousands everyday, just close my trades green before 4:00 pm and sleep comfortably at night that’s it…. </td>

The bullish thesis over time is intact but the Monday power run caught the shorts off kilter and killed the eod plan. 
 
Tuesday&amp;#39;s sandbox will be loaded with new concerns. Stocks are on high alert and almost everyone wants to get on them now that there seems to be some peace about.  The only problem is that peace is a fantasy in this world. 
 
The volatility play is awesome provided you hit your marks at the extremes.  Down the road, we will have much lower stock prices but that won&amp;#39;t occur for a while. When the SPY dips back into the 20&amp;#39;s, pay attn to what is swirling around us and reassess.

Yrs ago, Verb went public as a hollywood auditionCo. Idea failed,but the technology was great. 
Verb took the tech &amp;amp; pivoted to a crm biz w/a live stream selling app &amp;amp; the goal of creating the next Big Ecommerce website. In under a yr, Verb landed 75 new enterprise customers. Doing this:
https://youtu.be/lpvFxCdvSjk

Now Verb is launching Market.live 
which is a centralized
(1 place) where all Verblive clients &amp;amp; new retail clients, can live stream promoting products, build brands, &amp;amp; sell their goods.

Verb has been quietly working on this for yrs &amp;amp; its about to launch

Over the past yr Verb built 2 beta websites to test ui/ux,
Hired Qvc SuperStar Kate Eckman who sold 4mm in makeup at 1 qvc show, to be Svp of brands, &amp;amp; likely host shows. Verb got
David Meltzer as its producer, creating content for Verbtv. He recently signed a 2 yr deal w/$AAPL to create 4 AppleTv. There has been hints its going to be shoppable using Verbtech.
Recently Verb signed Pitt Penguins &amp;amp; Fl. Panthers

I have never ever seen such a coordinated action against a country in couple of days... Just unbelievable! 
 
What this means is that I am really worried what the maniac, aka Putin, will do now... if someone is cornered, then they will go to any extent to inflict the maximum damage!  And, Russia possesses more nuclear heads than even US.  It&amp;#39;s scary times ahead! 
 
Hopefully, someone on his inner circle cools him down as we are getting into an unknown terrain with all these coordinated action, imho.

My thoughts on the mkt today ... 

I sent an email alert out to members when we were approaching 438 mentioning I was a seller (short) at that 438/439 level. We hit 438.2 and went straight down, making new lows. 

Why the short? Well, there was an awful lot of negative news today that got blanketed by Russia/Ukraine &amp;quot;cease fire&amp;quot; talks. Bad economic data. Fed Gov Bostic emphasizing the need to remove liquidity. Oh, and the overhang of Putins nuclear war rhetoric. 

The trade made sense, until it didn&amp;#39;t. And with 30 minutes left, the mkt decided it didn&amp;#39;t as we ripped 45 handles into the close. Welcome to the 2022 stock market. 

We have some amazing ranges to trade in. I&amp;#39;ve been providing them to members daily. With such a huge week of data, Fed speak, testimony, and &amp;quot;war talk&amp;quot; - these days don&amp;#39;t get any less volatile. 

Mr. Tom Lee suggested February would be a violent rally, I took the other side. Now he says lows are in. Are you sure Mr. Lee?

Think about why for a moment.

But” if one thing could change, or a event were to happen before then of great significance” then that market could stabilize.

But the above answered my question on why this was dropping to atl while entire bev / h2ev sectors were on a tear.

This is a long term play for me and honestly have no doubt that this will be a great investment for me. Look how many times $TSLA has delayed/missed timelines on projects; and they are considered the best in the EV Sector. 

If you have doubts in a company, do some research and figure out if they are worth investing in. For me and my research I believe Lucid can and will be a great EV maker in the future. Honestly, I think $LCID has great battery technology seeing as the range is incredible compared to most EVs. In the future Lucid could potentially spin off their battery making or sell their battery tech to the major car brands and make a killing.  

Just my opinion, do your own DD. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $LCID is at the literal bottom of the S curve and we will need at least 3-4 years before we start seeing results shareholderwise if they can ramp. They are late in the game and don’t have the connections like $TSLA or $NIO. They have Saudi money but that doesn’t mean shit when supply chains are inflating the costs of production. They would run the company into the ground if they didn’t cut back but I expected it because reality will always hit. Not a bad company. $NIO is in the perfect spot to go parabolic because they are closing in on their Turing point of becoming the top EV maker in China by all metrics. $TSLA is the EV company at the highest point on the curve since they are generating profitability to shareholders. All different stages. If Tesla solves FSD and Nio starts ramping up those are the best short-medium term opportunities. Lucid needs hella more time so treat it as such </td>

Here’s an update to my rule of thumb about 52week high (HOY) vs 52week low (LOY) using my algorithmic multiplier factor of (2.314) :

👉LOY now is $700 
$700 X 2.314 = $1619.8 HOY - stock will reach within 52week of the low of yr made!! 

This is my own math I use personally- IMO

Be prepared for massive volatility here — don’t risk what you can’t afford to lose.  The risks here are huge but so is the potential.  

I wound never suggest an equity for trading but from a long-term perspective, here we may be onto a winner.  

It’s early days but so was it at some point for $TSLA or $NIO.  All amazing companies but these new entries into the market shouldn’t be overlooked. </td>

Look, trader or no trader — if you know what you are doing, you could be racking it in.   

I am a long-term - medium term investor and always get excited for technology. 

This is nothing sort of amazing progress.  

Mullen is also conducting extensive research and development into other advanced battery technologies, including lithium-sulfur and lithium-iron-phosphate. 

Mullen&amp;#39;s ultimate goal is to deliver EV batteries that will surpass today&amp;#39;s existing lithium-Ion technology and offer a host of benefits such as increased efficiency, energy density, and range while also lowering the cost, weight, thermal and environmental risks.

Exciting times.  

Mullen’s testing of solid-state polymer cells reveals the potential for a 150-kilowatt-hour battery pack that delivers over 600-plus miles of range and highlights an 18-minute DC fast charge which can yield over 300 miles of range. 

Mullen is working towards utilizing solid-state polymer battery packs in its second generation Mullen FIVE EV Crossovers, with in-vehicle prototype testing set for 2025. Mullen’s first-generation FIVE EV Crossover, due in late 2024, is planned to launch with traditional lithium-ion cell chemistry.

The potential is huge here.

An American 🇺🇸 EV maker under $2.   That’s insane. 👌🏻

Mullen’s testing of solid-state polymer cells reveals the potential for a 150-kilowatt-hour battery pack that delivers over 600-plus miles of range and highlights an 18-minute DC fast charge which can yield over 300 miles of range. 

Mullen is working towards utilizing solid-state polymer battery packs in its second generation Mullen FIVE EV Crossovers, with in-vehicle prototype testing set for 2025. 

Mullen’s first-generation FIVE EV Crossover, due in late 2024, is planned to launch with traditional lithium-ion cell chemistry.
