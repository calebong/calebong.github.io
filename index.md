   <td style="text-align:left;"> Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon says in-person attendance tops 50% after return-to-office push </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon's campaign to summon more of his employees back to the office is a work in progress that could take years, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In-person attendance at U.S. offices is between 50% and 60%, down from a pre-Covid figure of roughly 80%, Solomon told CNBC's David Faber on Monday. That figure is higher in European offices and 100% in Asian cities that aren't on lockdown, Solomon added.                                                                                                                                                     , "We want people to generally come together," Solomon said. "It's going to take some time, you know; behavior shifts take time generally, and I think over the course of the next couple years, our organization will generally come together."                                                                                                                                                                      , Solomon has been one of Wall Street's leading voices in trying to bring his people back to the office; he's called the remote work era "an aberration" that he would correct as soon as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , While rivals CEOs at JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have made similar comments, the ongoing push and pull at Goldman has gotten the most attention. Last year, the investment bank set up an array of food trucks outside its Manhattan headquarters and gave employees free meals to entice them to return.                                                                                                     , But the figures cited by Solomon are not much higher than the 50% attendance reported for the bank's New York headquarters back in February, when the firm made a renewed push after the latest wave of Covid subsided.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Fully half of the bank's roughly 50,000-person workforce are in their 20s, Solomon said. He cited a McKinsey report stating that Gen-Z workers crave more mentorship, which presumably happens more in an office environment than in remote settings.                                                                                                                                                               , Media reports last month cited Solomon's efforts to have workers return five days a week, and subsequent reports indicated some junior bankers were unhappy with their attendance being tracked by management. However, a person with knowledge of the bank said those reports were overly simplistic, focused on a handful of hard-to-verify complaints and that employees have more flexibility than is portrayed., "You waged a public campaign, it would seem, to have people show up five days a week," Faber said. "It feels like you lost."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Solomon said Monday that his campaign was "never as binary" as reports made it seem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "I have always had a view that's been rooted in flexibility and taking care of our employees," he said. "It's been portrayed sometimes as much more dogmatic than it is."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> London (CNN Business)Germany is ready to support a European ban on imports of Russian oil, and won't be "blackmailed" by Moscow into paying for natural gas in rubles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Speaking to CNN's Julia Chatterley on Monday, finance minister Christian Lindner said Germany would agree any new sanctions on Russia with its partners in the European Union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "Germany stands ready for new sanctions, including an oil embargo," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The European Union has already agreed to phase out Russian coal imports as part of a fifth wave of sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But the bloc has found it much harder to reach consensus on joining a US-led embargo on Russian oil despite weeks of talks. Hungary reiterated its opposition to an oil embargo again on Monday, Reuters reported.                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Lindner said he did not want to speculate on whether some EU member states, such as Hungary, would have to be given exemptions or carve outs from an oil embargo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "I can assure you that Germany is ready to reduce oil imports, we know others are considering this question carefully," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Last year, Russia accounted for about 27% of EU oil imports. It also supplied about 40% of Europe's natural gas. EU leaders have already promised to slash Russian gas imports by 66% this year, and to break the bloc's dependency completely by 2027.                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "We have prepared ourselves to be less dependent on Russian energy imports," Lindner said. "We can reduce the imports, starting with coal, then oil. It will take more time to be independent from Russian natural gas imports, but we will continue so in the end we will be completely independent from Russia."                                                                                           , Moscow raised the stakes in a tense energy standoff with Europe last week by cutting off supplies of natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria. State gas giant Gazprom said neither country had agreed to President Vladimir Putin's demand that customers in "unfriendly" countries must open two accounts at Gazprombank — one in euros and the second in rubles, from which payments for the gas would be made. , The vast majority of Gazprom's contracts with its European customers stipulate payment in euros or dollars. The Kremlin's ultimatum regarding ruble payments is widely seen as a move to bolster its war chest and boost the Russian currency.                                                                                                                                                               , Is Germany next?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , German gas distributor Uniper said last week it would continue to pay for its Russian supplies in euros but added that it believed a "payment conversion compliant with sanctions law" was possible. It said it was examining the matter carefully in close coordination with the German government.                                                                                                         , Lindner said he expected Germany's utilities to honor the terms of their contracts, which require payment in euros or dollars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "Germany can't be blackmailed, we know there is a dependency on natural gas from Russia, it is a reality.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The CAC 40 index closed 1.7% lower at 6,425 on Monday, extending last week’s losses amid pressure from the luxury goods and technology sectors while investors await interest rate decisions by the Fed and the BoE this week. The heavyweight luxury brands in Paris ended sharply lower, with Hermes down 2.8% and LVMH closing over 2% lower after PMI data from China was lower than expected, adding to projections of lower demand from one of the sector’s largest clients as the country tightens Covid lockdowns. The tech and auto sectors also booked losses, with Stellantis and STMicroelectronics shares both dropping over 2.5%, after the latter performed well in the previous week amid strong earnings results. On the data front, the French manufacturing PMI was revised higher in April, standing as one of the few European countries that accelerated growth during the period. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent Crude Steadies after Sharp 5% Fall </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures steadied near $107 a barrel on Monday after falling by over 5% to around $104 as traders weigh concerns about slowing economic growth in top importer China and fears of further supply disruptions from a looming EU ban on Russian crude. Data released over the weekend showed factory activity in China contracted for a second month to its lowest since February 2020 due to Covid lockdowns. Adding to bearish sentiment, Libya’s National Oil Corp said Sunday it would temporarily resume operations at the Zueitina oil terminal after suspending operations in late April due to political protests. Meanwhile, the EU is reportedly leaning toward a ban on Russian oil imports by year-end after discussions over the weekend. Around half of Russia’s 4.7 million barrels per day of crude exports go to the EU, supplying about one-fourth of the EU’s oil imports in 2020. </td>

It was “like looking into the sun, and all I can see are bright spots,” he recalled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , A person had pointed a laser at his helicopter. From 2010 to 2021, close to 70,000 pilots reported similar episodes, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Last year it recorded more than 9,700 cases, a record high, and a 41 percent increase from 2020.                                                                                                                                                                            , When a laser pointer reaches a cockpit, the light can disorient or “completely incapacitate” a pilot, who on a commercial airplane could be responsible for hundreds of passengers, the F.A.A. said. Some commercial flight paths have been disrupted, causing pilots to change course or even turn around.                                                                                                                                        , “What you might see as a toy has the capacity to momentarily blind the crew member,” Billy Nolen, the acting administrator of the F.A.A., said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Though no plane has ever been reported to have crashed as a result of a laser strike, Mr. Nolen said in a phone interview that there was always a risk of a “tragic outcome.” He added, “This is not an arcade game.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The F.A.A. said one factor for the increase in laser strikes was that lasers were becoming increasingly powerful, cheap and easy to purchase. Pilots may also be getting better at reporting the incidents, the agency said. Other observers point to a society frayed by the pandemic for the bad behavior.                                                                                                                                       , “If you’re invading the safety of my airplane, then you’re an aggressor,” said Capt. Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, the union that represents the pilots of American Airlines. “These are attacks.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , It is a federal crime to knowingly aim a laser pointer at an aircraft. Offenders can be sentenced to up to five years in prison; the F.A.A. can also impose civil penalties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In April, a Philadelphia man was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $1,000 for shining a laser at a police helicopter. In September, an Alabama man was sentenced to eight months in prison for aiming a laser at a helicopter flown by the local sheriff’s office. Also that month, a Milwaukee man was sentenced to a year of probation for pointing a laser at law enforcement aircraft during protests against police brutality in 2020., In many instances, however, cases are difficult to prosecute because airplane pilots cannot easily spot who is pointing the laser. As of early March, there had been more than 100 incidents involving lasers pointed at aircraft around Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The F.B.I. has offered a $10,000 reward to find those responsible.                                                                                                  , In some cases, those beaming lasers at aircraft have unwittingly led law enforcement officials directly to their location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In February 2020, while on patrol near Vacaville, Calif., about 55 miles northeast of San Francisco, Jan Sears, a California Highway Patrol pilot, said he was struck by a laser. His aircraft had an infrared camera that helped identify the source of the light.                                                                                                                                                                                , “It’s painful,” he said of the laser, describing symptoms that can include aching and watery eyes, headaches and blurred vision. Officer Sears said that for several days after the strike, he saw bright afterimages when closing his eyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “Teenagers do dumb stuff,” he said. “But when you start getting adults who do it, you start to wonder, What is your motivation?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , People who point lasers at aircraft can broadly be divided into two groups: those who are ignorant of the dangers they pose, and those who are antisocial, said Patrick Murphy, a laser safety expert who runs the website LaserPointerSafety.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , By the accounting of Mr. Murphy, who also serves on a committee that helps advise the F.A.A. and pilots about the issue, there have been more than 100,000 such strikes globally since 2004. Overwhelmingly, he added, those charged with pointing lasers are men.                                                                                                                                                                                 , “It’s a guy thing,” said Mr. Murphy, adding that when it comes to lasers, the bigger and more powerful, the better. “It’s like having a ‘Star Wars’ light saber,” he added. “‘It’s pretty awesome: I have this beam of energy coming out of my hand.’”                                                                                                                                                                                             , The Food and Drug Administration restricts the sale of lasers that are over five milliwatts for use as pointers, but experts say that more powerful lasers are easily purchased and that the devices are often mislabeled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , On TikTok, some videos promote high-powered lasers with links to purchase them. Such devices can be used at close range to pop balloons and light cigarettes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Though other countries have restricted the sales of the devices, Mr. Murphy and others said that such efforts were unlikely to succeed in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , He and other experts said that, for now, pilots should be educated about lasers and be prepared to respond to them. Many pilots have also started carrying protective goggles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But Mr. Hill, the emergency services pilot, was unlucky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , That evening in 2018, he was forced to abandon the rescue. Hours later, his eyes were still burning and aching, he said. By April 2019, he was on medical leave because of problems with his vision and balance. Mr. Hill, now 58, retired in April.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr. Hill’s doctors told him they could not find any evidence that his issues were linked with the laser strike, and experts say that permanent injuries from laser strikes are extremely unlikely. However, Mr. Hill said he believed there was some correlation.                                                                                                                                                                                  , “I know that I experienced this laser strike,” he said. “A little over three months later, I couldn’t fly.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Advertisement </td>

Reports surfaced late Thursday that Citi CEO Jane Fraser sent out an internal memo that said the bank worked hard to remediate the issues raised by OCC, one of the main federal regulators for U.S. banks. The memo said Citigroup strengthened internal controls, independent testing and how it conducts due diligence. Shares of Citigroup rose 0.7% on Monday.

The electric vehicle maker's stock had tumbled 19.2% in April, the biggest one-month decline since it plunged 21.6% in March 2020. April was also the seventh biggest monthly decline since Tesla went public in June 2010. The stock's weakness on Monday follows April deliveries reported by NIO Inc. undefined and Li Auto Inc. undefined that showed sharp year-over-year declines, as a COVID-19 resurgence in China led to supply chain, logistics and production challenges. Tesla revenue from China in the first quarter was 24.8% of total revenue, while China accounted for 25.7% of total revenue for 2021. "As Tesla resumed production on April 18 [in China], we expect EV deliveries to be up [month-over-month] relative to an April dud but subdued overall levels," Baird analyst George Gianarikas wrote in a research note. "We await additional data points around COVID restrictions in China to better understand future trends." Tesla's stock has been weighed down by concerns that Elon Musk, it's chief executive, would have less time to focus on the EV maker after he launched a bid to buy Twitter Inc. undefined, and following a near-$4 billion share sale of Tesla last week. Tesla's stock has tumbled 17.6% year to date through Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 undefined has shed 13.3%.,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Steve Gelsi covers banking and cannabis as a Senior Reporter for MarketWatch. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Billionaire investor Ken Griffin's hedge fund wowed the industry with big outperformance in April, overcoming a brutal market rout and extreme volatility.                                                                                                                                                                    , Citadel's multistrategy flagship fund Wellington rallied 7.5% last month, bringing its year-to-date performance to 12.7%, according to a person familiar with the returns.                                                                                                                                                    , Griffin's other funds also outperformed significantly, with tactical trading and global fixed income funds up 3% each and its equity fund jumping more than 4% in April, the person said.                                                                                                                                     , The standout performance came as the overall market suffered a steep sell-off on concerns about the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening, Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as surging inflation at a 40-year-high. The S&amp;P 500 lost 8.8% in April, its worst month since March 2020 at the onset of the Covid pandemic., Technology stocks were the epicenter of the April sell-off amid high interest rates and supply chain issues stemming from Covid-19. The Nasdaq Composite fell about 13.3% in April, its worst monthly performance since October 2008 in the throes of the financial crisis.                                                   , All five core investment strategies at Citadel — equities, commodities, global fixed income and macro, credit, and quantitative strategies — registered gains last month and are in the green for 2022, the person said.                                                                                                      , Investors have been seeking downside protection amidst the volatility spike triggered by fears of inflation and rising rates as well as geopolitical tensions.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lonnie Weakens Toward 4-1/2-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian dollar weakened toward $1.29 against its US counterpart, the lowest in almost 4-1/2 months as the DXY firmed around a 19-year high and oil prices declined amid global growth worries following weak Chinese factory activity. On the monetary policy front, the Bank of Canada already hiked its target for the overnight rate by 125bps to 1% this year and signaled further increases as the economy moves into excess demand and inflation persists well above the target. Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated faster than expected in March, hitting a 31-year high of 6.7%. The latest manufacturing PMI indicated robust operating conditions and extended the current period of growth to 22-months, but dipped to a joint 14-month low. This week, investors will be looking for the Canadian jobs report, which is expected to point to the third consecutive month of expansion in the workforce but by the lowest number since last October. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada 10-Year Bond Yield Climbs to Near 11-Year High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada's 10-year government bond yield tracked the move in US Treasuries and rose to as high as 2.95% at the beginning of May, the highest in almost 11 years as investors bet interest rates will continue to rise. The Bank of Canada already hiked its target for the overnight rate by 125bps to 1% this year and signaled further increases as the economy moves into excess demand and inflation persists well above the target. Canada's annual inflation rate accelerated faster than expected in March, hitting a 31-year high of 6.7%. This week, investors will be looking for the Canadian jobs report, which is expected to point to the third consecutive month of expansion in the workforce but by the lowest number since last October. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York City raises its COVID alert level to medium to reflect rising case numbers - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York City has moved its COVID-19 risk level to medium, or yellow, from green, according to the city's health department website, signaling that cases are rising at an undesirably fast pace. The city is currently seeing nearly 2,500 new cases a day, which is up from about 600 in early March. The number may be even higher as many people are now testing at home and the data is not all being collected. It's unclear for now whether Mayor Eric Adams will reintroduce certain public safety measures such as face masks in indoor settings. The health department is recommending that New Yorkers keep up vaccines and boosters, wear a face mask in indoor settings and get tested if they are unwell. "If NYC's Alert Level is raised to High, the City will consider requiring face masks in all public indoor settings," said the health department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Shares of Tesla Inc. undefined slumped 1.2% in premarket trading Monday, adding to their worst monthly performance in more than two years, after China-based electric vehicle makers reported delivery declines. The electric vehicle maker's stock had tumbled 19.2% in April, the biggest one-month decline since it plunged 21.6% in March 2020. April was also the seventh biggest monthly decline since Tesla went public in June 2010. The stock's weakness on Monday follows April deliveries reported by NIO Inc. undefined and Li Auto Inc. undefined that showed sharp year-over-year declines, as a COVID-19 resurgence in China led to supply chain, logistics and production challenges. Tesla revenue from China in the first quarter was 24.8% of total revenue, while China accounted for 25.7% of total revenue for 2021. "As Tesla resumed production on April 18 [in China], we expect EV deliveries to be up [month-over-month] relative to an April dud but subdued overall levels," Baird analyst George Gianarikas wrote in a research note. "We await additional data points around COVID restrictions in China to better understand future trends." Tesla's stock has been weighed down by concerns that Elon Musk, it's chief executive, would have less time to focus on the EV maker after he launched a bid to buy Twitter Inc. undefined, and following a near-$4 billion share sale of Tesla last week. Tesla's stock has tumbled 17.6% year to date through Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 undefined has shed 13.3%., Ciara Linnane is MarketWatch's investing- and corporate-news editor.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which sets the tone for corporate and household borrowing costs worldwide, topped 2.99% for the first time since December 2018 as investors stuck to bets that the Federal Reserve will deliver the first of many 50bps interest rate hikes this year. Last week wrapped up with a hot inflation reading, with the Fed's preferred inflation gauge's core personal consumption expenditures price index advancing 5.2% from a year ago. With inflation running at 40-year highs and the job market extremely tight, the Federal Reserve had no choice but to change the narrative and signalling a faster tightening. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Japan 10-Year Bond Yield Rebounds </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the benchmark Japan 10-year JGB bounced back to 0.235% and remained close to the Bank of Japan’s target ceiling after hitting a six-year high of 0.251% on April 20th, as investors digested the central bank’s monetary policy meeting in the previous week. The Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged and reiterated its commitment to defend the yield target by buying any amount of government bonds necessary on a daily basis to keep yields below 0.25%. Now, investors anticipate a US Fed meeting later this week, where a 50 basis point rate hike is widely expected, and could trigger even further sales of Japanese government bonds in the secondary market. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Mexico Factory Activity Remains in Contraction in April </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P Global Mexico Manufacturing PMI was relatively unchanged at 49.3 in April of 2022, compared to 49.2 in the prior month. The figure marked the 26th consecutive month of contraction in factory activity, as shrinking demand led to further declines in production. Volatility in energy prices, raw material scarcity, and limited shipping availability due to Russia’s war against Ukraine lifted input costs at the third-sharpest rate on survey record. Consequently, the rate of charge inflation passed to consumers climbed to a 46-month high. At the same time, manufacturers noted increasing capacity pressures in April, thus increasing employment. Looking forward, business confidence was seen higher, with hopes of resolution to geopolitical tensions spurring expectations of an economic rebound and improvements in supply chains. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Supreme Court says Boston violated First Amendment rights of group seeking to raise Christian flag outside City Hall  - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday that Boston violated the First Amendment rights of a group seeking to briefly raise a Christian flag atop a city flagpole outside of City Hall as a part of a city program celebrating Boston's greater community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The court said that the flag display amounted to a public forum, and because many other groups were allowed to raise their flags in celebration of the Boston community, the city could not discriminate on the basis of the religious group's viewpoint without violating the Constitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "We conclude that, on balance, Boston did not make the raising and flying of private groups' flags a form of government speech," Justice Stephen Breyer wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The case was filed in 2018 after a Boston official denied the application by the group Camp Constitution to raise a flag -- described as "Christian" in the application -- on one of the three flagpoles outside Boston's city hall. The group is an all-volunteer association that seeks to "enhance understanding of the country's Judeo-Christian moral heritage."                                                                                                                                                                                          , Central to the case was whether the flagpole is perceived as an example of government speech. If so, the city has a right to limit displays without violating free speech principles. The Free Speech Clause of the Constitution restricts government regulation of private speech, it does not regulate government speech. But if, on the other hand, the display amounts to private speech, in a government-created forum where others are invited to express their views, the government cannot discriminate based on the viewpoint of one of the speakers. , Breyer concluded that the flag-raising program "does not express government speech."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , All of the justices agreed on the outcome of the case, but three conservative justices said they had different reasons for ruling against Boston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Justice Samuel Alito, writing for Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, said that though the court relied upon "history, the public's perception of who is speaking, and the extent to which the government has exercised control over speech" to determine that the flag-raising program did not amount to government speech, he would have analyzed the case based on a more exacting definition of what constitutes government speech.                                                                                                                 , Under a more narrow definition of government speech, Alito wrote that it occurs "if -- but only if" a government "purposefully expresses a message of its own through persons authorized to speak on its behalf."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , He said the flag program in Boston "cannot possibly constitute government speech" because the city never deputized private speakers and that the various flags flown under the program "reflected a dizzying and contradictory array of perspectives that cannot be understood to express the message of a single speaker."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Boston occasionally allows private groups to fly flags, which are often flags from different countries, on one of the flag poles as part of a program to celebrate various Boston communities. The flag-raising events are in connection with ethnic and other cultural celebrations or the arrival of dignitaries from other countries or to commemorate historic events.                                                                                                                                                                                     , According to Camp Constitution, Boston in the 12 years prior had approved 284 other flags that private organizations had sought to raise as part of the program and no other previous applications had been rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In a case of unusual bedfellows, the conservative Christian group seeking to fly its flag gained the support of both the Biden administration and the American Civil Liberties Union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , 'A purely religious message'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Boston resident Hal Shurtleff, the founder of Camp Constitution, emailed the city's senior special events officials in 2017 seeking permission to raise the Christian flag and feature a presentation with local clergy focusing on Boston's history. At the time, there was no written policy to handle the applications, and the city had never denied a flag-raising application.                                                                                                                                                                           , The city determined that it had no past practice of flying a religious flag and the request was denied out of concerns the city would appear to be endorsing a particular religion contrary to the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. After the controversy the city created its first written Flag Raising policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Shurtleff sued the city, arguing that its denial of the flag violated his free speech rights under the First Amendment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A district court ruled in favor of the city, holding that the city was justified in denying the Camp Constitution flag because the display amounted to government speech. A federal appeals court affirmed the district court, holding that the raising of the Christian flag "would threaten to communicate and endorse a purely religious message on behalf of the city."                                                                                                                                                                                    , Shurtleff appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that Boston had violated the First Amendment because the flagpole displays amounted to a public forum and his group was denied because of its religious viewpoint.

Flag Poles forum solely because the flag was called 'Christian' is unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination," his lawyer argued.

a temporary flag-raising event that was open to other groups.

              , In supporting Shurtleff, David Cole, the national legal director of the ACLU, argued in The Washington Post that "no reasonable observer would understand flying Camp Constitution's flag -- for just one hour on a single day -- to be the government's speech."

flown before, the flag would be seen as the group's flag "and as such, the city can't turn it down because the flag is religious."

did not amount to government speech in part because the city typically exercised no control over the choice of flags.

Douglas Hallward-Driemeier, an attorney representing Boston, told the justices that the flagpole "that stands prominently at the City's seat of government is a means by which the City communicates its own message and has not simply been turned over to private parties as a forum to pronounce their own messages, including those antithetical to the City's."                                                                                                                                                                                           , He said that the flag-raising program's goals were to commemorate flags from many countries and communities to create an environment in the city where "everyone feels included and is treated with respect."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s main stock index, the S&amp;P/TSX, pulled back further in the first session of May, eyeing lows not seen since late January, as weakness in oil and gold prices put pressure on heavyweight energy and material stocks, down more than 1% each. On the data front, Canada’s manufacturing PMI declined to 56.2 in April, the lowest since January, as ongoing shortages of raw materials and trucks have limited gains from a robust increase in new orders. On corporate news, convenience store group Alimentation Couche-Tard and British peer EG Group have reportedly been in talks for a merger deal that would bring two regional giants together and combine over 21 thousand brands, with the potential to bring in $70 billion in annual revenues. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Factory Growth Slows Again in April </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The ISM Manufacturing PMI for the US fell for a second straight month to 55.4 in April of 2022 from 57.1 in March and compared to market forecasts of 57.6. It was the lowest reading since July 2020, as a slowdown was seen in production (53.6 vs 54.5 in March), new orders (53.5 vs 53.8), and employment (50.9 vs 56.3). Meanwhile, price pressures moderated (84.6 vs 87.1) while the backlog of orders decreased (56 vs 60). “The US manufacturing sector remains in a demand-driven, supply chain-constrained environment. In April, progress slowed in solving labor shortage problems at all tiers of the supply chain”, Timothy Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Construction Spending Misses Forecasts </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Construction spending in the US increased by 0.1 percent from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of USD 1.731 trillion in March of 2022, slowing from a 0.5 percent advance in February and missing market expectations of a 0.7 percent gain. Spending on private construction rose 0.2 percent, mainly due to higher expenditure for new single family residential construction (1.3 percent) and communication infrastructure (0.1 percent), while spending fell for commercial construction (-1.9 percent). On the other hand, public construction outlays fell 0.2 percent from the previous month, dragged down by lower spending for non-residential construction (-0.3 percent). </td>

That compares with 7 pounds for easy-peelers -- which include mandarins, tangerines, tangelos and clementines -- but it has been on a steady climb. If that trend holds and supply is ample, oranges may slide to 8.5 pounds a year by 2025, closely matching mandarins and their cousins, with mandarins taking the lead after that, according to David Magana, senior fresh produce analyst for agricultural lender Rabobank International. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo Index, Ibovespa, fell over 1% to around 106,780 on Monday, a low level not seen since January 18th, tracking a negative sentiment in international markets, due to concerns over global growth and the next steps of the Federal Reserve. Locally, traders cautiously await the Brazilian central bank's decision on Wednesday, with policymakers expected to deliver another 100bps rate hike to 12.75%. Meanwhile, the central bank's weekly Focus survey revealed inflation forecasts were revised higher for the 16th straight week to reach 7.89% in 2022 and 4.10% next year. At the same time, growth projections were raised to 0.7% from 0.65% in 2022 and were kept unchanged at 1% in 2023. On the corporate front, commodity-linked sectors were the main draggers. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Manufacturing PMI Revised Lower but Points to Strong Factory Growth: S&amp;P </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P Global US Manufacturing PMI was revised lower to 59.2 in April of 2022 from a preliminary of 59.7, but remained above 58.8 in March. The rate of overall factory growth accelerated for the third month and was the strongest since September, driven by a quicker expansion in output, a softer deterioration in vendor performance and a series-record rise in pre-production inventories. Although lead times lengthened further, severe material and capacity shortages at suppliers led to sharper increases in cost burdens and selling prices. Meanwhile, firms continued to hire additional staff to ease pressure on capacity, as backlogs of work rose at the slowest pace since February 2021. At the same time, firms were strongly upbeat regarding the 12-month outlook for output, but concerns regarding inflation and geopolitical tensions pushed confidence to the lowest for six months. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada Factory Activity Growth Slows in April </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P Global Canada Manufacturing PMI declined to 56.2 in April of 2022, from an all-time high of 58.9 in March, marking the 22nd month running of expansions. Production levels rose sharply, mostly for producers of consumer goods, followed by makers of investment and intermediate goods, respectively. Main upward pressure came from robust growth in new orders, with firms saying they could secure new domestic clients and higher sales abroad. Also, backlogs of work increased sharply as shortage of materials and trucks more than offset higher staffing levels, although firms complained of shortage of skilled workers. On the price front, input price inflation moderated from March’s peak, while the rise in selling charges accelerated to the 2nd fastest in the survey’s history. Lastly, business outlook moderated from March and stood below the long-term average, pressured by elevated cost pressures and uncertainty due to the geopolitical environment. </td>

In October, Tencent suspended more than 1,400 WeChat accounts after the government launched a crackdown on internet posts that it deems are harmful to the economy.                                      , Tencent said the accounts had made bearish calls about financial markets, "distorted" the interpretation of economic policies, or spread rumors. A public account run by Chen Guo, chief strategist for Shenzhen-based Essence Securities, was among them.                                                                 , Likely trigger for the social media ban?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , It's not entirely clear which of Hong Hao's posts triggered the most recent ban.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The last reports posted on his WeChat public account were titled: "Be wary of capital flight" and "What should Chinese ADRs worry about."

He also blamed China's tech crackdown, rather than new US rules on listings by foreign companies, for being behind an epic sell-off in Chinese ADRs in March., In another note on March 21, Hong also predicted the Shanghai Composite would drop below 3,000 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Last Monday, the Shanghai Composite fell below 3,000 for the first time in 21 months, as rising Covid-19 cases in Beijing sparked fears that the Chinese capital could join Shanghai and other major cities in lockdown.                                                                                                   , China's stock market is the second worst performing in the world so far this year, behind Russia, according to Refinitiv Eikon.                                                                                                                                                                                            , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Stocks Remain Under Pressure </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> All three major US stock indexes kicked off May on a sour note, as investors wrestled with the shocks of an aggressive tightening, potentially causing a recession, and an ongoing war in Ukraine, further stoking inflation. High-growth technology stocks remained under heavy pressure, with mega-cap names such as Amazon.com, Tesla, Apple and Microsoft down between 0.1% and 2.4%. Last week wrapped up with disappointing guidance from Amazon and Apple technology titans, while the hot inflation reading underscored the challenging macro environment. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge's core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 5.2% from a year ago. Investors now look ahead to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on Wednesday, betting that the Fed will deliver the first of many 50bps interest rate hikes. </td>

He said Berkshire bought a 14% stake in about two weeks. "I find that just incredible," said Buffett. "You wouldn't be able to do that with Berkshire." Buffett said that "overwhelmingly," large U.S. companies have become "poker chips," with people buying and selling call options as opposed to making investments. He said the "gambling" nature of the stock market enabled Berkshire to quickly buy 14% of "a business that's been around for decades," Buffett said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P Global Brazil Manufacturing PMI fell to 51.8 in April of 2022, from 52.3 in the previous month. The latest reading pointed to slower growth in production and new orders amid persistent supply bottlenecks, while growing uncertainty led to a faster drop in international sales. Meanwhile, the rate of job creation was the quickest since last October, driven by a rebound in business confidence. On the price front, both input and output costs eased in April. Still, inflationary pressures remained sharply high amid soaring energy costs and raw material scarcity. </td>

as Middle East airlines operating out of hubs like Dubai and Doha face down the threat from Qantas and its direct service.                                                                     , Qantas could also have a challenge on its hands to make the flight comfortable and entertaining for passengers, Mr Charles added, as well as ensuring their wellbeing.                                                                                            , Asked whether other airlines could follow Qantas' lead in launching ultra-long haul flights, he said: "The question is in 2025 when this is due to launch, what will the world look like?"                                                                        , "Will we want to fly such long-haul routes or will consumers want to fly short-haul on more environmentally friendly flights that are shorter in duration?"                                                                                                       , The experience of ultra-long haul flying can be "brutal on the body", according to travel YouTuber Noel Philips.                                                                                                                                                  , Mr Philips has flown 18 hours on a non-stop Qatar Airways flight from Auckland to Doha, and 16 hours on a non-stop Qantas flight from London to Perth.                                                                                                            , "The problem is you're sort of stuck in one position for such a long period of time," he said.                                                                                                                                                                    , "Especially with some of the older aircraft, there's the issue of dehydration on the body as well, which can take it out of you.                                                                                                                                  , "But the airlines are recognising these flights can be brutal on the body and doing things to make it a bit easier.                                                                                                                                               , "You were getting smoothies to help with your hydration... and the entertainment Qantas had on their Perth route was really good."                                                                                                                                , He said he reckoned there would be "incredible demand" for the service due to the family and business ties between the UK and Australia.                                                                                                                          , "If people can do a non-stop flight, I think people will prefer to do a non-stop flight to Australia," he added.                                                                                                                                                  , "With a stopover somewhere it's just prolonging the whole experience and it turns into a bit of a faff."                                                                                                                                                          , Currently Qantas operates non-stop flights between UK and Australia, with Boeing 787s linking London's Heathrow Airport and the Northern Territory city of Darwin.                                                                                                , The flight from Australia takes about 17 hours, and the return journey is about 16 hours long.                                                                                                                                                                    , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Amir and Faryal are back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , How films turned a racing cyclist into a bank robber                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Steve Coogan on cancel culture and the role comedy plays in society                                                                                                                                                                                               , © 2022 BBC.

       shot up 10.6% in very active premarket trading Monday toward a four-month high, after the Israel-based lidar technology company said it has been selected to become the direct lidar supplier to "one of the largest vehicle manufacturers in the world." Trading volume spiked to 9.6 million shares, compared with the full-day average of about 669,000 shares, and enough to make it the most active stock in the premarket. Innoviz said the selection will boost its forward-looking order book by $4.0 billion to $6.6 billion. The company said it will provide more details on the order when it reports first-quarter results on May 11. The stock has rocketed 37.4% amid a five-day win streak through Friday, which started after it closed at a record low of $2.94 on April 22, but it has tumbled 36.3% year to date.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Front-month heating oil futures traded around $4 per gallon at the start of May, after hitting a seven-week high of $4.18 on April 29th, as volatility faded and investors continued to assess tight inventories despite a backdrop of downside risks from China. The latest EIA weekly inventory report showed domestic distillate stocks, which include heating oil, shrank by 1.45 million barrels, much more than median estimates of a 0.29 million barrel draw, bringing the total US inventory of distillate fuel to 79% of the 5-year average for the week ended April 22nd. Overseas, the increasingly likely ban on Russian energy products by the EU could push heating oil futures in the US to new all-time highs, due to the risk of supply chain disruptions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Federal Reserve's fight with inflation could cool the hot labor market, risking stagflation </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates in an effort to defuse an explosive year of price inflation. But global forces could neutralize the effects of that tightening of monetary policy, and keep inflation high.                                                                                    , Some observers believe the U.S. government may have misread the looming threat of inflation. During the pandemic, Uncle Sam dispersed historic sums of cash to blunt widespread economic damage. Analysts say this stimulus produced strong household savings. A boom in demand for durable goods followed. , This surge in demand came as global supply chains stalled out, and a persistent bout of inflation followed. In March 2022, prices across all categories rose to historic levels, 8.5% year over year. And investors believe the price hikes aren't over yet, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey., "The only way to break the back of inflation that's running out of control is for very tight monetary policy, " says Richard Fisher, former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. "It slows things down because everything becomes expensive."                                                   , Today's inflation isn't spiraling in the way it did in the recent past, however. From 1965 to 1982, inflation soared, at times reaching double-digit rates. In 1979, the central bank, under Chair Paul Volcker, kicked off a tightening cycle that resulted in interest rates of nearly 20%.               , Strong monetary policies killed inflation, but also led companies to offshore labor costs. As a result, American workers saw their labor income stagnate relative to productivity for four decades.                                                                                                         , This period in U.S. economic history is remembered for stagflation, which describes the duel threat of stagnant growth and persistent inflation.                                                                                                                                                            , Today's Federal Reserve leaders hope to avoid such a dramatic turn of events. But their plan could backfire, as many of the root causes of inflation are outside of the bank's control.                                                                                                                     , Watch the video above to learn more about the central bank's fight against stagflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rice Hits Near 2-Year High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rice futures were trading around $17.1 per hundredweight, a level not seen since June of 2020, amid rising demand from the animal feed industry. Rice has become a cheap alternative to wheat and corn, especially in China, the world’s largest feed market after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine stopped grain shipments from these two countries. China’s rice imports are currently forecasted to be at their highest levels since 2018, especially broken rice, usually used to feed livestock. The US Department of Agriculture was expecting global rice output to exceed consumption by about five million tons in 2022, reaching a record 190 million tons, as increased supplies from India and Thailand are set to offset a rise in global consumption. At the same time, soaring fertilizers costs are driving farmers across Asia to reduce their use, which could mean lower crop yields and push up the rice prices even higher. </td>

"We hope the Spirit Board will now recognize that ours is clearly a superior proposal and engage with us more constructively than they have to date.", However, after a review by Spirit's board, the Miramar, Florida-based airline determined that the deal involves "an unacceptable level of closing risk" that would be assumed by its shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Spirit noted that obtaining regulatory approval from the Justice Department would be difficult due to the agency's concerns that JetBlue's Northeast Alliance (NEA) with American Airlines will stifle competition.

Under the deal, Spirit shareholders will receive 1.9126 shares of Frontier plus $2.13 in cash for each existing Spirit share they own. Once completed, the cash and stock deal, on a combined basis, is expected to produce annual revenues of $5.3 billion and synergies of $500 million.                                                                                                                                 , The deal will create the nation's fifth-largest carrier and give travelers more options to fly to mid-sized cities as well as underserved regions, according to the companies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sugar futures on ICE traded at the $19.5 per pound mark, rebounding from the five-week low of $18.95 touched on April 25 amid lower supply and high oil prices. Brazilian industry group Unica said sugar production in the center south region of the country fell 80% year-on-year to 126,630 tonnes in the first half of April, well below expectations of 279 thousand. The group noted that 74% of sugar cane production in early April was allocated for ethanol production, picking up from 61.2% in the corresponding period of the previous year as higher oil prices increased the demand for biofuels. Meanwhile, Rabobank said that raw sugar prices are expected to increase in the third quarter of 2022, given potential Russian energy disruptions in Europe, fertilizer shortages, and political risks linked to the presidential election in Brazil. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wall Street Struggles for Traction </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures tracking the broader market were virtually flat on Monday, the first trading day of May, as investors wrestled with the shocks of an aggressive tightening, potentially causing a recession, and an ongoing war in Ukraine, further stoking inflation. Last week wrapped up with disappointing guidance from Amazon and Apple technology titans, while the hot inflation reading underscored the challenging macro environment. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge's core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 5.2% from a year ago. Investors now look ahead to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision on Wednesday, betting that the Fed will deliver the first of many 50bps interest rate hikes. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are coming off their worst month since March 2020, when the pandemic took hold, declining 4.9% and 8.8%, respectively, in April. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plunged 13.3% in April, its worst monthly performance since October 2008. </td>

that JetBlue’s acquisition offer would be unlikely to be approved as long as that airline’s recently announced partnership with American Airlines was in effect. A recent communication from JetBlue “makes clear” that the airline is not willing to end that partnership, known as the Northeast Alliance, Spirit said in the letter. The Justice Department and several states have sued to block the JetBlue-American partnership, arguing that it is anticompetitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In a statement, the chairman of Spirit’s board, Mac Gardner, said that the company stood by its plan to merge with Frontier Airlines, a deal that predates JetBlue’s offer and which Spirit argued represents the best interests of long-term shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “After a thorough review and extensive dialogue with JetBlue, the board determined that the JetBlue proposal involves an unacceptable level of closing risk that would be assumed by Spirit stockholders,” Mr. Gardner said. “We believe that our pending merger with Frontier will start an exciting new chapter for Spirit and will deliver many benefits to Spirit shareholders, team members and guests.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Spirit and Frontier, both low-fare airlines, had announced a plan to merge in February. Then, JetBlue stepped in with a bigger offer for Spirit last month. Both deals would face scrutiny from Biden administration regulators, who have expressed more skepticism about consolidation than their predecessors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Some analysts contend that Spirit and Frontier are better suited to merge because they operate under a similar “ultra low-cost” business model but have more extensive flights in different parts of the United States. A JetBlue-Spirit combination could be more difficult to pull off because the airlines’ business models are quite different. But the deal could allow JetBlue to more effectively compete against the nation’s four dominant airlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Spirit said that regulators would likely be “very concerned” with the prospect that JetBlue’s offer would result in higher costs, and subsequently higher fares for consumers. For example, Spirit said that converting Spirit’s planes, which are densely packed with seats, to JetBlue’s roomier configuration would result in higher prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In its response on Monday, JetBlue said it would offer to divest Spirit’s assets in New York and Boston, two markets that regulators have expressed concern about in their lawsuit seeking to strike down the Northeast Alliance. JetBlue also argued that both its offer and the Frontier deal shared “a similar regulatory profile,” but that Frontier has not offered to divest assets or pay a breakup fee. JetBlue also said that the value of Frontier’s cash-and-stock deal has faded because of that airline’s falling stock price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “Spirit shareholders would be better off with the certainty of our substantial cash premium, regulatory commitments, and reverse breakup fee protection,” JetBlue’s chief executive, Robin Hayes, said in a statement on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , JetBlue accused Spirit of having failed to grant it sufficient access to data about the low-cost carrier’s business while requesting “unprecedented commitments” from JetBlue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , By Adam Satariano                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , European Union regulators said on Monday that Apple had broken antitrust laws by unfairly undercutting companies whose payment services compete with Apple Pay, in the latest example of European authorities cracking down on the world’s largest tech companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Apple has abused its dominance in consumer electronics by not allowing PayPal and others to access technology in the iPhone and Apple Watch that lets people make a purchase with a quick tap, according to a preliminary judgment announced by the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The commission argues that Apple blocks rival services from accessing the hardware and software on its devices that enables the interaction with payment terminals in stores, known as near-field communication technology or NFC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The case illustrates Europe’s strategy of using several kinds of action to regulate the digital economy. In addition to antitrust cases, the European Union has agreed to two new laws since March intended to address what policymakers see as anticompetitive business practices and weak policies by internet and social media firms to remove illicit content from their websites and services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The charges against Apple, following an investigation that began in 2020, were announced in Brussels on Monday by Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of antitrust enforcement. Apple will now have a chance to respond before a final judgment is announced. The company could be fined up to 10 percent of its global revenue. It could also reach a settlement with regulators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Regulators said Apple has used its control of the iPhone and other products to become the dominant service in the fast-growing area of mobile payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Mobile payments play a rapidly growing role in our digital economy,” Ms. Vestager said in a statement. “We have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple’s devices.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , On Monday, Apple said that it provided an “easy and secure” way to make payments, and that its policies did not restrict competition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security,” the statement said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “We will continue to engage with the commission to ensure European consumers have access to the payment option of their choice in a safe and secure environment,” Apple said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , European regulators have been trying to address what they see as abusive business practices by big tech companies that use their dominance in one area to take control of adjacent markets. Last year, Ms. Vestager brought antitrust charges against Apple in response to complaints by Spotify and others about the 30 percent commission the company levies on purchases made inside apps, a case that is still under review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Google has been fined billions of euros for using the dominance of its search engine, Android mobile operating system and its advertising services to box out rivals. Amazon is under investigation for abusing the dominance of its shopping service to harm merchants who rely on its website to reach customers. And Facebook is being probed for anticompetitive practices related to its control of the market for social networking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Europe’s tough approach to technology regulation long found little echo in the United States, but American authorities have begun to use antitrust enforcement to crimp the power of Big Tech. The Justice Department has brought antitrust charges against Google and the Federal Trade Commission is going after Facebook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , With his $44 billion deal to take Twitter private, The Times’s Anupreeta Das and Lauren Hirsch write, Elon Musk is departing from the traditional private equity playbook. He’s putting up far more of his own money than is usual in such a deal, about three quarters of the price. But he’s also following more standard practice for what Wall Street calls a leveraged buyout, borrowing $13 billion that would be transferred onto Twitter’s books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In other words, they write, his plan for Twitter includes both more cash than the typical buyout and more debt than Twitter may be able to handle, given its patchy profitability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The structure of the deal, Ms. Das and Ms. Hirsch write, is risky for a number of reasons:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Musk’s push for unfettered “free speech” on Twitter could find itself in conflict with the company’s basic need to pay off its new debt. If less restrictive moderation of content on the platform leads to more unfiltered exchanges and misinformation, Twitter’s main source of revenue — advertising — could suffer, since most advertisers are wary of associating their brands with polarizing content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The company doesn’t yet have other meaningful sources of revenue, although it has experimented with subscriptions. If advertising revenue falls, Twitter, which employs more than 7,000 people, could struggle to make interest payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The acquisition is also a big financial risk for Mr. Musk, more than usual for private equity-style buyers who often limit their exposure by using mostly borrowed money instead of cash. Because of the way the acquisition is structured, a downturn in Twitter’s fortunes could stretch even Mr. Musk’s considerable financial resources — and challenge his reputation for business savvy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Because Mr. Musk is both selling Tesla shares and putting them up as collateral for personal loans to raise cash, Tesla’s value would be linked to Twitter’s. Any trouble at Twitter could force Mr. Musk to draw on his stock in the electric carmaker he runs to plug potential holes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , And any problem at Tesla that causes its stock to fall far enough could trigger clauses in Mr. Musk’s personal loans that would require him to add more collateral, limiting his ability to invest in Twitter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , READ THE FULL ARTICLE →                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Over the past two years, Americans who own their homes have gained more than $6 trillion in housing wealth, Emily Badger and Quoctrung Bui of New York Times’s Upshot report. To be clear, that doesn’t mean homebuilders have transferred to buyers $6 trillion worth of new housing, or that existing homeowners have made $6 trillion in kitchen and bathroom upgrades.

simple fact that housing, in short supply and high demand across America, has appreciated at record pace during the pandemic. Millions of people — broadly spread among the 65 percent of American households who own their home — have gained a share of this windfall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , It’s a remarkably positive story for Americans who own a home; it’s also inseparable from the housing affordability crisis for those who don’t. For them, Ms. Badger and Mr. Bui write, rents are rapidly rising. Inflation is whittling away their incomes. And the very thing that has created all this wealth has pushed homeownership as a means of wealth-building further out of reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , READ THE FULL ARTICLE →                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , A central mystery of Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter is how the company’s board went from installing a “poison pill” when he made an unsolicited bid on April 14 to agreeing to sell to him just 11 days later, The Times’s Lauren Hirsch and Mike Isaac report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In most megadeals, they write, the adoption of a poison pill — a defensive maneuver to stop a potential buyer from accumulating more of a company’s shares — leads to a protracted fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But interviews with a dozen people close to the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly, revealed to Ms. Hirsch and Mr. Isaac how few options Twitter’s board had. Here’s how the deal unfolded:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , On the evening of April 13, Mr. Musk, who had amassed a more than 9 percent stake in Twitter, sent a text message to Bret Taylor, Twitter’s chairman, telling him he would be sending him an offer letter. It arrived the next morning, declaring his intention to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share, but it had few details about his plans for the company or the financing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Twitter’s board did not quite know how to handle Mr. Musk’s bid, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Mr. Musk did not have a track record of buying companies and had not followed through on some deals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , A day after Mr. Musk’s bid became public, Twitter’s board voted unanimously to slow him down by authorizing the poison pill. But Mr. Musk was undeterred. His bankers began trying to corral tens of billions of dollars in financing for a Twitter deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Mr. Musk also campaigned on Twitter for a deal. He hinted that he would take his proposal directly to shareholders in a so-called tender offer if the company’s board did not accept his bid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Twitter’s board fractured. On April 16, Jack Dorsey, a Twitter founder who stepped down as chief executive in November and is a board member, tweeted that the board had been the “consistent dysfunction of the company.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Dorsey’s criticism rankled other board members and Twitter executives, said two people who worked on the deal. Mr. Taylor asked Mr. Dorsey to stop tweeting negatively, one person said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , On April 21, Mr. Musk lined up $46.5 billion in financing. He had obtained commitments from Morgan Stanley and other lenders for $13 billion in debt financing, while another group of banks promised $12.5 billion in loans against his stock in Tesla. Mr. Musk added that he would use another $21 billion in cash to buy the rest of Twitter’s equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The financing forced Twitter’s board to take Mr. Musk seriously. No other offers for the company had emerged, two people familiar with the deliberations said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , At Twitter, Mr. Taylor weighed employee uncertainty and the societal implications of a deal versus the board’s fiduciary duty, people with knowledge of the situation said. That meant making a decision based on whether Twitter could reasonably achieve a value better than what Mr. Musk had put forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , On April 23, Mr. Musk spoke with Mr. Taylor and threatened to take his offer directly to Twitter’s shareholders, without explicitly saying he would start a hostile bid, a person with knowledge of the call said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The next day, a Sunday, Twitter’s board concluded that it had to make a deal with Mr. Musk. The company could not hit $54.20 a share on its own, board members agreed, and no white knight was coming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After the agreement was announced on Monday afternoon, Mr. Musk took a victory lap. “Yesss!!!” he tweeted, posting emojis of rockets, stars and hearts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , READ THE FULL ARTICLE →                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , By Coral Murphy Marcos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Amazon union: The National Labor Relations Board will begin to count ballots from Amazon workers seeking to unionize at a second warehouse on Staten Island. The vote was organized by the independent Amazon Labor Union, which won a union election at a nearby warehouse — a first at Amazon in the United States — in April.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Job openings: Economists will get another indicator of how many Americans are quitting their jobs when the Labor Department reports on the number of openings in March. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey will capture a period when businesses resumed normal operations as cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus declined sharply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Fed rate decision: The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates half a percentage point in its two-day policy meeting, following its quarter-point increase in March. Economists will want to know more details about how the Fed plans to move forward in its next meetings, with many adjusting to the idea that the central bank could raise interest rates more quickly than they had penciled in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , England’s rate decision: The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates a quarter of a percentage point in its policy meeting, but some economists forecast that the increase could be as much as half a point. Inflation in Britain climbed 7 percent in March, its fastest pace in 30 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , OPEC Plus meeting: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, will meet to discuss whether they should raise output in May by 432,000 barrels a day. The group’s outlook points to a “well-balanced” market despite the volatility that arose after Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Jobs report: The Labor Department will publish the widely watched jobs report, which is expected to show that employers added 385,000 jobs in April. The report will also include fresh data on unemployment, a figure that the Federal Reserve is keeping an eye on as officials worry that the labor market is showing signs of being excessively hot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The Federal Reserve is meeting this week. The economy is running hot, and the Fed is trying to slow it down before widespread price pressures become even more of a problem. It lifted interest rates in March for the first time since 2018, by a quarter of a percentage point, and has set the stage for an even larger increase of half a percentage point this week. The announcement is expected to come at the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , But while the rate decision is unlikely to be a surprise, economists and investors will want to know how the Fed plans to move forward at a time when inflation is rising faster than it has in decades. The recent performance of the stock market, which in April took its biggest monthly dive in two years, is hinting at economic trouble ahead, and is the latest complication in the Fed’s fight against inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The outlook for inflation is wildly uncertain. On one hand, the Fed’s small rate increase has already pushed mortgage rates sharply higher, which may start to weigh on the housing market and cool off related types of demand. Nonetheless, costs for raw materials and other key inputs continue to climb, and may keep doing so amid the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. Already, some companies, like the washing-machine maker Whirlpool, are seeing consumer demand wane compared with last year, though it is still higher than before the pandemic. “Historic levels of inflation, notably in raw materials, energy and logistics, will impact us throughout the year,” James W. Peters, Whirlpool’s chief financial officer, said last week in a conference call., Americans have been feeling the pain of higher prices, even if they are spending through it. A record share of people in a Gallup poll named inflation as the top U.S. economic problem, survey data released last week showed. Officials spent much of 2021 hoping that pandemic-era cost increases would fade as supply chains returned to normal. Instead, inflation has remained too high for the Fed’s comfort for a year, and it has become broader with time. A higher-than-expected jump in wage data released Friday made a second big increase in June more likely “at the margin,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.                                                                                                                  , At the same time, the stock market has had a bad year. The Fed has long said it doesn’t make decisions based on the market, but clearly the recent stock rout makes raising interest rates harder. The S&amp;P 500 fell 8.8 percent in April, and is down more than 13 percent in 2022. The drop shows many investors are coming to the same conclusion: The economy is about to take a hit, and everywhere they look, they see trouble ahead. “There are definitely a lot of open-ended and unquantified risks looming,” said Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The DILF Manufacturing PMI in Denmark rose to 63 in March of 2022, from a downwardly revised 61.9 reading in March, indicating the most robust expansion in factory activity since last December. Upward pressure stemmed from all sub-indices, save for production (62.3 vs 66.3 in March). The strongest contribution came from new orders (57.7 vs 54.3), stock of purchased products (48.3 vs 40.0) and stock of finished products (34.4 vs 37.0), while smaller contributions came from employment (63.7 vs 63.3). On the price front, input cost inflation regained momentum to a three-month high (78.8 vs 77.9). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Turkish Lira at 4-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Turkish lira weakened to 14.9 per USD in early May, the lowest since December of 2021, as deep trade imbalances and a large negative real interest rates offset efforts by the central bank to stabilize the currency. The TCMB imposed new reserve requirement rules for banks to control loan growth and encourage conversion of foreign currencies to the lira, while also cutting the interest rate on lira-denominated required reserves to zero and ending interest payments on amounts converted from foreign currency. The moves follow ongoing revisions of the central bank’s policy framework to encourage the permanent “liraization” to the Turkish economy, including extending the tax exemption of corporations converting foreign currency to the lira and hiking the foreign revenue ratio that exporters are required to sell from 25% to 40%. In its April meeting, the TCMB held its key interest rate at 14%, despite Turkey’s latest inflation reading coming at a 20-year high 61.1%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the Indian 10-year government bond was around 7.1% in early May, tracking a global rise in bond yields, and close to a 35-month high of 7.2% hit on April 11th, as investors continue to worry over inflationary pressures, prospects of slower growth and monetary policy tightening. Meanwhile, some investors covered short positions, while easing oil and record Goods and Services Tax revenues in April due to better tax compliance prevented the bond yields to go even higher. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago soybeans futures were trading below $17 per bushel, moving lower in tandem with other US grains, as investors took a breather from a massive rally that saw the benchmark hit a record high of $17.5 in late April. Still, fundamentals in the soybean complex continue to be supported by prospects of solid demand for US supplies and tight global supplies amid adverse weather in South America and ongoing shipment disruptions from the Black Sea region. New-crop soybean sales are up 64% from a year earlier at 10.7 million, signalling that demand will remain strong into 2023 and reflecting top buyers' concerns that global supplies may remain tight for at least another year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Indian Rupee Remains Under Pressure as USD Soars to 20-Year Highs </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Indian rupee was around 76.5 per USD in early May, remaining under pressure as the greenback soared to levels not seen in nearly 20 years as the Fed is expected to deliver a 50bps hike in the fed funds rate this week, which would be the biggest increase in borrowing costs since 2008. Domestically, the RBI took a surprise hawkish move in its April monetary policy meeting by restoring the corridor for its liquidity adjustment facility to the pre-pandemic level of 50 basis points, hinting at withdrawal of its accommodative stance going ahead. The central bank is now expected to raise its key interest rate in June and opt for a steeper rate hike path to tame inflation, according to Reuters. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gasoline futures declined to $3.4 a gallon, not far from an over seven-week high of $3.5 reached in the previous week, pressured by weak demand for oil products in China amid stringent lockdown measures, more than offsetting upside risks from a possible EU blockade on Russian oil &amp; gas. Chinese health authorities continued to crackdown on virus outbreaks in China’s largest cities, while over the weekend PMI readings showed further contractions among goods producers and service providers. Adding to downside risks, Libya’s state-owned oil company said it would resume operations at a major oil terminal as protests calmed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Swiss franc was at 0.97 per USD in early May, the lowest in two years, as a hawkish Fed elevated the dollar amid signals of a 50bps rate hike in the Funds rate this week. Meanwhile, the SNB said it does not plan to deviate from its ultra-loose monetary policy any time soon, as Chairman Jordan said current levels of inflation are temporary. In its last meeting, the SNB emphasized it would limit the franc’s appreciation after hitting a 7-year high against the euro following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sight deposits at the SNB rose to CHF 744.4 billion in the final week of April, CHF 7.24 billion more than that of the prior month. The deposit increases are widely seen as a proxy for the central bank’s foreign currency interventions, dictating the amount of credit added on sight accounts of commercial banks with freshly created francs in exchange for foreign currency. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Silver bottomed below the $23-an-ounce mark, a level not seen since early February, as impending interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve sparked a rally in the dollar, which, in turn, spooked investors away from the metal. The Central Bank is widely seen raising the target for the fed funds rate by a half-point to 0.5%-1% later this week to tame inflation, currently at 40-year highs. Still, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and broadening inflationary pressures lifted the safe-haven bids for the precious metal. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on Britain's 10-year Gilt was around 1.9% in early May after breaking above 2% for the first time since November 2015 later in April, as investors bet the Bank of England will not raise rates as much as initially expected as the British economy is showing signs of slowdown. Retail sales fell much more than expected in March as soaring prices hit spending and squeezed the UK living standards. Also, the CBI gauge for factory orders tumbled to a 6-month low and confidence among UK factories slipped the most since the Covid crisis. Meanwhile, the Bank of England will likely hike interest rates for a fourth straight meeting on Thursday but economists mostly expect the Bank Rate to rise to 1.5% by early 2023 and stay there throughout the year, according to a Reuters poll. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)As Donald Trump badgered Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on an hour-long call to "find" the votes necessary to flip the battleground state to Trump's column after the 2020 election, a Raffensperger aide fired off a plea for help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "Need to end this call," Jordan Fuchs, then the deputy secretary of state, said in a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. "I don't think this will be productive much longer."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , She added: "Let's save the relationship."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The little-noticed text messages, included in a recent court filing, provide a deeper look at the chaos that ensued as the former President pressed Raffensperger to help prove Trump won in Georgia -- a state Trump lost. That call now stands at the center of an investigation into Trump, which is set to advance this week when Atlanta-area prosecutors convene a special grand jury to determine whether any of Trump's actions related to Georgia's election -- or those of his allies -- were criminal.                                            , Meadows eventually did wrap up that tense call back in January 2021, suggesting lawyers from both sides should connect again soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Thank you," Fuchs said. "Wow."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Fuchs declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been digging into Trump's calls with Raffensperger and another official in the Secretary of State's office; presentations former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani made before state lawmakers that were riddled with election falsehoods; a phone call between South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Raffensperger; and the sudden departure of Byung "BJay" Pak, the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.                                                                                           , Willis is poised to seat the grand jury in the middle of a hotly contested Republican primary season in Georgia. She has said she will delay calling witnesses -- several of whom are on the ballot -- to avoid interfering with the primary. Meantime, as former Republican Sen. David Perdue challenges Gov. Brian Kemp in the GOP gubernatorial primary, new evidence is emerging about Perdue's efforts to backchannel with Georgia officials about the 2020 election results.                                                                           , For Willis, her probe has been playing out against a backdrop of racist threats that began the moment she announced an investigation into Trump. For Monday's jury selection, officials are planning to close roads surrounding the courthouse, station snipers on the roof and have K-9 police dogs at the ready, according to people involved in the planning. Prosecutors on Willis' team have also been issued bulletproof vests, said a person familiar with the situation.                                                                             , The sweeping investigation has sought to determine not only whether Trump committed crimes but also whether there was a broader criminal conspiracy playing out in the efforts to overturn Georgia's election results. In document preservation requests to Georgia officials in February 2021, Willis said she was investigating potential crimes including solicitation of election fraud, making false statements to government bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and violence or threats related to election administration. , Over the past 15 months, investigators in Georgia have interviewed more than 50 witnesses, with plans to subpoena at least 30 others, Willis told the Atlanta Journal Constitution and a source familiar with the probe confirmed to CNN. Once the special grand jury is empaneled, prosecutors will be able to subpoena witnesses that may include some of Trump's closest associates.                                                                                                                                                                      , "I imagine that we're going to be issuing subpoenas to a lot of people, and that all of them are not going to welcome our invitation to come speak with us," Willis told CNN in February.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , A special grand jury does not issue indictments, but it possesses broader investigative powers than a typical grand jury in the state as well as the power to issue subpoenas for witness testimony, phone, email and other records. If the special grand jury recommends an indictment, Willis could then seek one from the other grand juries regularly empaneled in Fulton County.                                                                                                                                                                        , The Georgia investigation is playing out as the House select committee has already collected a mountain of information, including some relating to the Trump team's efforts in Georgia. The House select committee and Willis' team have already been in contact about ways to share information, according to sources familiar with the situation, although it's still unclear if she has access to material like Meadows' texts. Some of that information could bolster Willis' efforts or even open new avenues of investigation.                         , "Any relevant information no matter where it comes from will be reviewed and part of the investigation," said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman for the Fulton County district attorney's office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Text messages from Meadows show Perdue's efforts to help Trump                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Perdue jumped into the governor's race last year after Trump -- still livid over Kemp's role in certifying the 2020 election -- went hunting for a Republican to challenge the incumbent governor. Earlier that year, Perdue had lost his US Senate seat in a runoff election against Democrat Jon Ossoff. It was a loss many Republicans blamed on Trump, complaining Trump's constant election fraud claims had depressed the GOP vote.                                                                                                                    , Now that he's running as the Trump-backed candidate, Perdue has fully embraced baseless election fraud claims, opening an April debate against Kemp by saying, "folks, let me be very clear tonight, the election in 2020 was rigged and stolen."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Previously unreported text messages which were obtained by CNN and are among those Meadows selectively provided to the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, reveal Perdue also played a role in working to sway Georgia officials last year while he was preparing for his runoff fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Georgia Attorney General Chris "Carr won't be any help with SOS," Perdue wrote to Meadows on December 13, 2020. "I have a call into the Governor's general counsel now to see if they might help."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The text came days after Trump spoke to Carr and reportedly encouraged him not to rally Republicans against a lawsuit Trump allies filed with the Supreme Court to toss millions of votes from Georgia and other battleground states. In a response to the Supreme Court on December 10, Carr urged the justices to reject the Trump-backed lawsuit.

But she told the Atlanta Journal Constitution she doesn't intend to call witnesses to testify until June 1, after Georgia's May 24 primary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , A number of those potential witnesses -- including Raffensperger, Carr and Kemp -- are on the GOP primary ballot, facing off against a slate of election-deniers. All of them, in addition to Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan who is not running for reelection, received document preservation requests last year. They are not expected to be targets of the probe, according to document preservation letters Willis sent last year.                                                                                                                                , "I would not request that anyone that was on the ballot come speak to me prior to May 24. I've run a campaign, I know how busy, crazy you are," Willis told CNN in a February interview. "I think that you wouldn't even be able to think clearly to really give us the type of interview I need. However, when we get past that point I can't wait around until some election in November. I just can't do that."                                                                                                                                           , Several staffers from the Secretary of State's office participated in voluntary interviews with Willis' team and Raffensperger previously told CNN he would share information if he received a subpoena. Carr and his staffers have not yet participated in interviews with investigators, according to his office.

Moore, the former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia between 2010 and 2015 under President Barack Obama, said that Willis should expect a series of challenges from Trump's legal team if she pushes ahead with subpoenas for his inner circle or, eventually, an indictment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "There's this big crescendo that has led up to this special grand jury, then everybody's going to be waiting to see is there an indictment or is there a decision to charge," Moore said.

The House investigators said they wanted to look at the back-end data related to hundreds of emails from the Trump campaign and the RNC to their supporters from November 3, 2020, to January 6, 2021, because the emails suggested the election results were fraudulent and asked for donations, according to court filings. , The House is trying to learn who worked on the email campaigns, how successful they were, and also how the marketing software company, Salesforce, reviewed and analyzed the pro-Trump rallies on January 5 and 6 and communicated with GOP officials, the court record says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The judge noted the data, which is in Salesforce's hands, won't reveal major secrets of the Republican Party's internal workings to the Democratic-held House.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "House Defendants are not seeking, and Salesforce is not producing, any disaggregated information about any of the RNC's donors, volunteers, or email recipients, including any person's personally identifiable information. Moreover, even the RNC's own confidential information that is undeniably at issue is relatively narrow in scope," Kelly wrote.                                                                                                                                        , The House Select Committee continues to pursue evidence and witnesses related to the events on and leading up to the riot. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson announced last week that the committee will hold eight hearings in June which will be a "mixture of some prime time and some regular" hearings.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Former President Donald Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is expected to appear before the committee this month after months of negations between lawmakers and the former New York mayor, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , CNN's Paula Reid, Annie Grayer, Ryan Nobles, Daniella Diaz and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The British pound hold near $1.25 in the beginning of May, close to low levels not seen since June of 2020, amid a strong dollar as the Fed is expected to tighten monetary policy faster than most central banks to curb rising inflationary pressures. In the UK, the Bank of England will likely hike interest rates for a fourth straight meeting on Thursday, bringing borrowing costs to 1%, their highest level for 13 years. Still, the British economy is showing signs of slowdown which could prevent the central bank to raise rates as much as initially expected. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures hit a two-week high of $7.536 per million British thermal units, as traders continued to assess maintenance-related outages and strong demand prospects. Above-average demand lingered in the eastern states amid remnants of chilly weather, while output continued to face volatility amid the ongoing maintenance season and the recovery from freeze-offs in the Rockies in late April. Elsewhere, the US continues to ship high volumes of LNG to Europe, which is expected to keep export facilities running at near full capacity due to the war in Ukraine and the risk of supply disruptions from Moscow to the region amid the euro payments spat. Lastly, EIA data showed a 40 billion cubic feet injection into domestic storages in the week ended April 22nd, less than the 5-year average build of 53 bcf, widening the gap between current stocks and the 5-year average levels. </td>

There were decreases in households’ assessments of their own past financial situation and their intentions to make major purchases, while consumers’ expectations about their future financial situation edged up slightly after the steep fall of March. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Copper futures bottomed around the $4.3-per-tonne mark, a level not seen since late December, as coronavirus-induced lockdowns in top consumer China sparked concerns about demand and growth. Data released over the weekend showed factory activity in China contracted for a second month to its lowest since February 2020. On the flip side, weak growth in the world's second-largest economy has already triggered government pledges for more stimulus to spur investment and consumption. On the supply front, Southern Copper and the Peruvian government have initiated talks to resolve an ongoing conflict between the Tumilaca-Pocata-Coscore-Tala farming communities and the Cuajone copper mine that forced a suspension of production for more than 50 days. </td>

A 10-year AA corporate bond is yielding 3.94% and a 10-year treasury note is yielding 2.96%.  These are the 2 of the safest investments you can make. Currently the higher return is the S&amp;amp;P. If the S&amp;amp;P return was the same as AA corporates at 3.94% the S&amp;amp;P market price would be (ESP 182 + dividend 66 / .0394) = $6294. Even if the GDP does half as well growing at 1.5% I have the S&amp;amp;P valued at 6115. This is buy time in my opinion. </td>

Manufacturing lower from supply chain issues, there ARE NOT ENOUGH GOODS to supply all the consumers that want them, this is going to breed heavy-heavy inflation.

Manufacturing employment not needed because there are no things to make....
Employment however going higher IN EVRRY OTHER SECTOR, we&amp;#39;re going to see 3.4% unemoyment rate based on jobless claims lower week to week and job creation #s will shock to upside, 450K, further boosting.....

high inflation 🥵

&amp;quot;Traders tell me they are shorting Digital World only around the margins now because it is difficult to borrow shares that are in limited supply. But if the SEC approves the SPAC, they expect about 200 million shares to flood the market, and the stock to crumble to as low as $5 as people weigh the utility of a right-wing Twitter substitute.&amp;quot;

AAPL had been a leader in this market downturn. AAPL has held the greatest toward its ATH&amp;#39;s. imo it now risks of taking a bigger fallout if the market continues downward. If this daily trend line support breaks with earnings out of the way AAPL could see a larger move to the downside. The technical break could also fuel a move down.

 Hear Elon Musks thoughts on Joey here ... www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/analyst... 
 
 When  Ford analyst Rod Lache put out his price target for $RIDE  it wasn&amp;#39;t on behalf of Deutsche Bank, it was from his own (for profit)   research firm , Wolfe Research, who for some odd reason felt compelled to put out guidance on Lordstown motors one day ....
