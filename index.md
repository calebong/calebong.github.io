   <td style="text-align:left;"> P&amp;O Ferries' sackings were appalling, says Sunak </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> P&amp;O Ferries' sacking of 800 staff without warning last week was "awful" and "wrong", Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told the BBC.                                                                                                                                                                                          , The government is examining the legality of the firm's actions, the chancellor confirmed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , However, the Sunday Times reports that ministers knew of the plan to sack crew beforehand, but failed to challenge it.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The Department for Transport said "full details" were not available at that stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , A memo sent to ministers by a senior Whitehall official - and seen by the Sunday Times - outlined P&amp;O Ferries' strategy before the sackings took place, the newspaper said.                                                                                                                                            , According to the Sunday Times, the note said the sackings were designed to ensure P&amp;O remained "a key player in the UK market for years to come through restructuring".                                                                                                                                                , The memo, as reported in the newspaper, said: "We understand that P&amp;O Ferries have an intention to try and re-employ many staff on new terms and conditions or use agency staff to restart routes; they estimate disruption to services lasting 10 days."                                                              , It was circulated before Thursday's announcement, made over Zoom, telling 800 P&amp;O staff that they were losing their jobs with immediate effect.                                                                                                                                                                        , The news was met with outrage from trades unions representing crew and ministers responded with strong criticism, announcing they would review all government contracts with the firm.                                                                                                                                 , Mr Sunak, speaking to Sophie Raworth on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, said P&amp;O's approach was "appalling in the way that they've treated their workers".                                                                                                                                                         , The government does not appear to have voiced concerns directly to P&amp;O before the sackings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was standard practice for officials to outline what they had been told by a private firm in an internal memo.                                                                                                                                                               , "This was sent before ministers were advised of the full details and as soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which P&amp;O staff had been dismissed," a DfT spokesperson said.                                                                                                          , The DfT said the memo made clear that the department's priority was to "work with unions to ensure workers' rights continue to be protected".                                                                                                                                                                          , The transport secretary had urged the company to "sit down with workers and reconsider this action", the DfT added. Grant Shapps has said he was "deeply concerned" at the move.                                                                                                                                       , In a statement, P&amp;O Ferries said: "We took this difficult decision as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options but, ultimately, we concluded that the business wouldn't survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements, which in turn would inevitably result in redundancies.", P&amp;O Ferries is owned by Dubai logistics giant DP World which is, in turn, controlled by the Dubai sovereign wealth fund.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Late on Saturday night P&amp;O Ferries resumed its service between Liverpool and Dublin.

CP's network runs across much of southern Canada and extends as far south as Kansas City in the United States.                                               , The lockout is the latest blow to Canada's battered supply chain, which last year weathered floods in British Columbia that washed out track and suspended access to Canada's biggest port. CP has said a stoppage would disrupt the movement of grain, potash and coal.                   , CP had notified the union on Wednesday that it would lock out employees on Sunday, barring a breakthrough in talks on a deal covering pensions, pay and benefits.                                                                                                                          , It said the key bargaining issue is the union's request for higher pension caps.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)President Joe Biden and his fellow world leaders hope to finalize and unveil a package of new measures to punish Russia, help Ukraine and demonstrate Western unity at a string of emergency summits in Europe this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But aside from a dramatic wartime show of resolve, few observers believe anything the leaders can agree upon will be enough to end the bloodshed in Ukraine or dissuade Russian President Vladimir Putin from continuing his attacks that are increasingly harming civilians.                                                                                                                                                                    , Since the prospect of the NATO leaders summit was first broached roughly two weeks ago, American and European officials have been discussing potential announcements for leaders to make at the conclusion of the gathering, according to several people familiar with the plans.                                                                                                                                                                , That could include new rounds of sanctions on Russian oligarchs, additional measures restricting the country's finances and new steps to limit import of Russian energy products. Discussions are also underway on what measures can be unveiled to provide more support for Ukraine, including new shipments of military assistance or financial aid to bolster the country's defenses.                                                         , And Biden has left open the option of scaling up US troop deployments to NATO members along the alliance's eastern edge, reinforcing American commitment to European defense at a critical moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But the stark reality that those moves are unlikely to curb Putin's war will loom over Biden's visit to Brussels for a snap meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, along with a special session of the European Council and a gathering of the G7. Biden could also add another stop in Eastern Europe, potentially Poland, officials have said. He departs Washington on Wednesday for the high-level diplomatic maneuvers.         , While Biden has been successful in rallying European and Asian allies behind a punishing set of sanctions and unparalleled levels of military assistance, he and his NATO counterparts have drawn lines at where their support will end. And while all parties seem to support a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, US and European officials say the parameters of such a settlement remain murky.                                            , That leaves open how Biden's visit to Europe -- one of the inflection moments of his presidency -- can alter the course of the worst conflict in Europe since World War II. And it poses another discussion point that world leaders must begin to broach: What happens if, or when, Ukraine can no longer withstand Russia's assault?                                                                                                           , "They're going to have to look at what happens if Ukraine is lost," said retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander. "After they have weighed the problem of what happens if Ukraine falls, they have to consider what more can be done to sustain Ukraine in the fight. Yes, there's a risk. There's always a risk in dealing with Mr. Putin."                                                                      , Biden challenged to be 'the leader of the world'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Biden was publicly challenged by Ukraine's leader last week to assume responsibility for bringing an end to the fighting. In an emotional address to Congress, in which he called for a no-fly zone and help procuring fighter jets, President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke directly to Biden, who was watching from his private library on the third floor of the White House.                                                                      , "Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace," Zelensky said in English.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Biden was also challenged by Ukraine's former President, Petro Poroshenko, to visit Ukraine as a "symbol of our solidarity" during his trip to Europe this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Speaking to CNN's Jim Acosta Saturday afternoon, Poroshenko called Biden a "very good friend of mine and a very good friend of Ukraine," adding that a visit by Biden would be "an extremely right step to demonstrate that the whole world is together with us against Russia."                                                                                                                                                                 , Those personal appeals will have resonated with a man who vowed while seeking office to restore American leadership, renew US alliances and defend democracy from the creeping tide of authoritarianism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Nowhere will that challenge be more pertinent than at this week's emergency talks, where leaders are looking to Biden for direction and purpose as the war in Ukraine grinds ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "He's challenging Biden to live up to his responsibilities as a leader of the West, a leader of the democratic community of nations. And he presented the de facto challenge to NATO," said Ian Brzezinski, a deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO in the George W. Bush administration.                                                                                                                                    , "He was saying if NATO is not up to this challenge, we have to think of other security arrangements," Brzezinski said. "What a powerful challenge to the relevance of NATO in this day and age. That sets the context for ... (the) summit meeting."                                                                                                                                                                                             , The limits of supporting Ukraine on full display ahead of trip                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Yet as the summits were announced last week, some European diplomats revealed concern at what they viewed as a lack of major steps available for the leaders to take at the high-profile gathering, which both Russia and Ukraine will be watching closely.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Major items that Ukraine wants, like help from NATO in establishing a no-fly zone or providing Soviet-era fighter jets, appear for now off the table as the US and its partners seek to avoid direct confrontation with Russia. That means any announcement coming out of the meetings would likely focus more on ramping up assistance that's already being provided, including military and financial aid, or applying new sanctions on Russia., European and US officials said discussions about announcements and a concluding joint statement were ongoing as countries look to settle on a decision or takeaway for the summit to produce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "The President is looking forward to seeing his counterparts face to face. I suspect they will have a number of new measures that they will be able to disclose and roll out during those conversations, but I'm not going to get ahead of them a few days in advance," US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said last week on CNN.                                                                                                     , Having a major announcement materialize during the summit could help underscore the current unity among the allies, which US officials say has surprised Putin as his military struggles with losses on the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "He miscalculated about the West. I think he thought that ... there would be some scolding, maybe a couple of sanctions, but he could withstand it, and he could continue, and he could move on," said Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Instead, he has inspired a resurgence of NATO. And the West is united in opposition and trying to provide not only sort of strengthening NATO and the flank countries on Ukraine's border, but also in providing support to Ukraine."                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Countering China will be top of mind after Biden-Xi call                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The upcoming summits will also present Biden an opportunity to take his counterparts' temperature on another matter: What to do if Chinese President Xi Jinping decides to provide Russia military or economic support, as Putin has requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , On a 110-minute call with Xi last week, Biden laid out the "implications and consequences" of going ahead with that support, according to the White House. But punishing China -- the world's second-largest economy -- would be far more complicated than it has been with Russia, and would require the same unity with Europe, which hasn't always agreed with Biden on how to approach Beijing.                                              , "This is an incredibly important summit. It is taking place on an extraordinary basis in the midst of a crisis. It is partly to make sure that we and our allies [are] on the same page, which is good. But it's also very important for sending a signal to Vladimir Putin," said Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to NATO and special envoy for Ukraine.                                                                                    , Volker identified several messages the alliance must send during its summit, including recommitting to the Article 5 guarantee of collective defense and making clear the use of nuclear weapons by Russia would warrant a Western response.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But he said NATO must also make clear that Ukraine -- not a member of its grouping -- is nonetheless a matter of critical importance to its members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "I think it's very important that NATO also send a signal about Ukraine, that Ukraine's survival as an independent and sovereign state in Europe is a NATO interest," Volker said. "We don't want to say what we don't do. We don't want to be too specific about what we will do. But we need to send a signal to Putin that we're not going to sit by while he destroys and eliminates a sovereign European country."                          , </td>

He added that the crew were not representing Ukraine but wearing colors from their alma mater: Bauman Moscow State Technical University.                               , "Sometimes the color yellow is just the color yellow. The flight suits of the new crew were designed to match the colors of the emblem of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, from where all three cosmonauts graduated. The design of the uniforms was coordinated long before the current events. Seeing the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is just a clinic [in propaganda]," another Roscosmos official wrote in his Telegram channel "Closed Space.", Cosmonauts typically pick their flight suits months in advance, which would predate Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it's unclear when the cosmonauts selected this yellow and blue color scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "For Soyuz flights, typically the crew meets with the company that makes the suits months before flight and they are allowed two custom suits," a NASA astronaut who has flown on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS told CNN. "Typically, one suit is the same across the crew, and the second suit is something personal."                                                                                                                                             , "I think it would be a real challenge to make and launch these (flight suits) last minute. Not impossible though," a former NASA astronaut who has also flown on a Soyuz spacecraft to the ISS said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , When the three cosmonauts arrived at the space station Friday, they spoke to callers on the phone, one of whom asked about the yellow color. Commander Oleg Artemyev responded jokingly, "We actually had a lot of yellow material, so we had to use it. So that's why we had to wear yellow."                                                                                                                                                                              , Veteran former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who has been a staunch critic of Russia's invasion, noted the uniforms in a tweet, written in Russian and English: "Three Russian cosmonauts who have just docked at the International Space Station have arrived in Ukrainian yellow!"                                                                                                                                                                                          , Cosmonauts Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov will spend the next six and a half months aboard the space station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , When the hatch opened at 5:48 p.m. ET Friday, the three were welcomed aboard the ISS by two other Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts, and one European Space Agency astronaut. The crew were all smiles and embraced one another after the new arrivals floated through the hatch in their bright yellow suits.                                                                                                                                                       , CNN's Ashley Strickland contributed to this report. </td>

"It is hard to imagine that in the 21st century people can be forcibly taken to another country."                                  , Earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian army commander told CNN that people in Mariupol risk their lives each time they emerge from underground bunkers and claimed the strategic port is facing the most intense fighting anywhere in the country.                                                                                                                , With Russia's assault in its fourth week, Major Denis Prokopenko, from the National Guard Azov Regiment, told CNN that air and land attacks on the city were now almost relentless.                                                                                                                                                                      , "Usually, Mariupol is under fire during the whole day and night. Sometimes there (are) 30 minutes of silence, but then the city is again under attack (from) tanks, artillery, multiple rockets, and (aircraft) like bombers and helicopters," he said.                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , More than 4,100 people, including 1,172 children, were evacuated Saturday from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia via humanitarian corridors, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior official in President Volodymyr Zelensky's office.                                                                                                                          , Mariupol has been under siege for several weeks and has seen some of the worst attacks in the war since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in February. These have included deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater, the losses from which are still unknown as the rescue operation continues.                                , The city lies on a stretch of coast connecting the eastern region of Donbas with the Crimea peninsula, both of which have been under Russian control since 2014. Russian forces appear to be trying to take full control of the area to create a land corridor between the two regions, squeezing Mariupol with brutal military force.                   , Russia has denied targeting civilians in Mariupol, blaming casualties on Ukrainian forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Prokopenko said people in the city were now reluctant to leave their underground shelters even to get hold of essentials, meaning they were trying to drink less water and eat less food, only emerging to prepare hot meals.                                                                                                                            , "People are cooking food in the streets, risking their lives under the continuous shelling and bombing," the military commander said. "The temperature is minus 5 degrees Celsius in the street."                                                                                                                                                        , Basic services like gas, electricity and water, are all out in the city. Bodies are being left in the street because there is either no one left to collect them, or it is simply too dangerous to try.                                                                                                                                                  , Prokopenko said no one knew the exact number of people killed. "Some people are buried under ruined buildings, buried alive," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Information about a huge attack three days ago on a theater in Mariupol being used as a shelter has been slow to emerge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , An image taken Saturday by the Maxar satellite imagery provider shows about two-thirds of the Mariupol Drama Theater completely destroyed, with just the western facade still standing.                                                                                                                                                                  , The building, which also acted as the city's main humanitarian assembly station, was providing a temporary home to 800 to 1,300 people when it was hit, according to local officials.                                                                                                                                                                    , Still clearly visible in the picture is the Russian word for "children" painted in large letters on the ground in front of the entrance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , He confirmed earlier reports that sustained Russian artillery fire made attempts to get survivors out of the building very difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Communications in the besieged city have been difficult for days and rescue work has been hampered by the danger of near-continuous shelling, according to reports from inside the city.                                                                                                                                                                 , Initial reports suggested many survivors had to dig themselves out of the rubble. Figures released by several Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, say 130 people have been rescued, among them one person with serious injuries.                                                                                                  , During a video call with the Ukrainian Minister of Culture Oleksandr Tkachenko on Friday, Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini offered to help rebuild the Mariupol Drama Theater.                                                                                                                                                             , Zelensky thanked Franceschini on Twitter Wednesday saying that Italy "set a good example to follow.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biden's strategy with Putin is decades in the making - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Joe Biden always says foreign relations is about relationships, and he's been developing the one he has with Vladimir Putin for two decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Biden warned that Putin had dreams of rebuilding an authoritarian empire going all the way back to his days as a senator from Delaware. On the campaign trail, he said repeatedly that he knew Putin didn't want him to win.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Since the beginning of his time as President, Biden has relied on his sense of the Russian leader to guide his own response. It's even guided the way Biden deals with Putin in their conversations, repeatedly interrupting what he and aides see as the Russian President's strategy of going off on tangents meant to muddle and undermine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , According to a dozen interviews with White House officials, members of Congress and others involved in the effort, Biden has deliberately worked with allies abroad to deny the Russian leader the one-on-one, Washington vs. Moscow dynamic that the President and his aides think Putin wants. Publicly and privately talking about the war as a fight for freedom and democracy, Biden has left other leaders to speak with Putin.                                                                                                                                                                    , He has moved just as deliberately at home to depoliticize opposition to the invasion of Ukraine so that, even among Republicans, support for Putin has been forced to the fringes so that vilifying the Russian leader has become the one major area of bipartisan agreement since Biden took office. This week Biden ratcheted up his rhetoric by calling the Russian President a "war criminal," a "murderous dictator" and a "pure thug."                                                                                                                                                             , "What Putin is trying to do is surround and encircle Kyiv," said Rep.

"What Biden is trying to do is have the whole world surround Putin."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Part of the lesson Biden took from being involved as vice president during Putin's 2014 invasion of Crimea was that NATO nations would need a much faster, more humiliating and more cohesive response than the months of infighting that produced sanctions so weak that Putin rode them out. Yet administration officials admit privately that if Putin had invaded Ukraine a year ago, events might have unfolded much differently coming right off four years of former President Donald Trump's damaging relationships and calling NATO obsolete.                                                   , Campaigning in 2020, Biden spoke about the confrontation he saw coming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Putin has one overriding objective: To break NATO, to weaken the Western alliance and to further diminish our ability to compete in the Pacific by working out something with China," Biden told CNN's Gloria Borger at the time. "And it's not going to happen on my watch."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Biden's own last conversation with Putin was on February 12, more than a week before the invasion started. And for a President and aides who on almost everything else complain that they don't get the credit they deserve, on Ukraine he and administration officials have ducked talk about him being leader of the free world, despite how much of the sanctions and international response are a result of Washington's guidance and pressure.                                                                                                                                                      , The result is Putin's being boxed in more than even Biden had expected, along with a sustained level of attention to the war abroad and in America that has surprised White House aides -- without rebooting a 1980s-style Cold War.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Joe Biden," a senior administration official said, "has known Vladimir Putin for decades and knows exactly who he's dealing with."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Cutting Putin off -- literally and figuratively                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Cutting off Putin began, as Biden might say, literally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Whenever they'd speak, Biden would interrupt Putin as the Russian President launched into complaints that American officials see as a whataboutism tactic designed to distract and undermine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , No, Biden would say, that's not what we're talking about, according to one senior administration official who has witnessed those conversations. Or, no, that's not how things happened 20 or 25 years ago, in whichever past grievance Putin was bringing up to justify his behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "President Putin can't use a lot of his common tricks with President Biden, like trying to confuse people by going down long historical tangents or meandering into the minutiae of policies because President Biden sees those tactics coming a mile away and doesn't take the bait. He'll try to get President Biden off topic by citing an obscure section of the Minsk agreements or a speech someone gave in the late 1990s," a senior administration official said, adding that Biden "is going to always steer the conversation directly back to what he's come to talk about."                   , Biden has often told a story of a meeting with Putin at the Kremlin in 2011, when he was vice president, and telling the Russian leader, "I'm looking in your eyes and don't think you have a soul" -- a cutting response to President George W. Bush's infamous 2001 comments getting a sense of Putin's soul from looking him in the eye and finding him to be "very straightforward and trustworthy." A Biden administration official, by contrast, sent CNN highlights of Biden's history on the topic over the years, from calling Putin a "bully" in 2006 to calling him a "kleptomaniac" in 2019. , A White House aide who was in the Situation Room for a rushed National Security Council meeting on February 10 said Biden's sense of Putin was on display throughout how he ran the conversation in which the White House's assessment of an invasion moved from a possibility to an almost certainty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "He was clear and clear eyed in that meeting that he believed that Putin would do this," the aide said.

But at the same time, Biden himself has kept up outreach to Republican lawmakers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , That's included personally briefing all four top congressional leaders together last month and surprising a bipartisan delegation to the Munich Security Conference with a call to thank them for their support. During that call, Vice President Kamala Harris held her cellphone to a microphone so the lawmakers could hear Biden speaking from behind the desk in the Oval Office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Putin has been tracking what Biden has been doing and saying about him for years. That includes friendly Russian commentators complaining in 2009 that Biden was a "gray cardinal" secretly orchestrating a tough Obama administration response to Putin's leadership after the then-vice president said Russia was limping along, or a Kremlin spokesman on Thursday saying that Biden's war criminal remark was "unacceptable and unforgivable."                                                                                                                                                       , Even as Biden has ramped up what he's been saying about Putin, there's only so far he can go before tripping into the escalation he's so desperately trying to avoid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "It hurts him to see the devastation in Ukraine, and it would be easy to say, 'That guy's evil and we're going after him and we're going to get him,'" Meeks said.

Jerome H. Powell, the current chair of the Federal Reserve, which began raising rates this week to fight persistently rising prices, recently called Mr. Volcker “one of the great public servants” of his era.                                                                                         , Recent inflation is getting harder to explain away as a temporary symptom of supply chain disruptions and trillions of dollars in emergency government stimulus. And it’s now being fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is pushing up energy prices in particular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , War has always spelled inflation. And looking back further — much further — into history provokes some ideas about how to contain it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , During the American Civil War, the Union and the Confederate governments each spent tremendous sums. Leaders on both sides were deeply worried about the possibility of runaway inflation. But the ways they addressed it were starkly different, as were the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In the Union, inflation over the course of the war totaled 80 percent. This was a serious burden for working families — then, as now, wages did not keep pace. Still, inflation was kept within reasonable limits given the circumstances and did not destabilize the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Confederacy fared much worse. It has been estimated that by the end of the fighting, in 1865, the South’s inflation rate overall was an unfathomable 9,000 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Granted, the U.S. economy has changed a lot since the 1860s. For one thing, it now has a central bank, which has a mandate to maintain stable prices. During the pandemic, the Fed under Mr. Powell has pushed its powers, which steadied markets but also stoked inflation. Now, much of the focus is on the Fed to unwind these programs, and raise rates, to bring prices down.                                                                                                                                                                                            , But fiscal policy is also a factor, as shown by the increasing worry over deficits as President Biden enacts an ambitious, and still unfinished, spending program. During the Civil War, the fiscal policies of the North and South markedly diverged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Annual spending in the Union reached a staggering 16 times its prewar budget. Despite the need for funds, there was great fear in Congress of increasing taxes because of Americans’ well-known antipathy to taxation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , But Salmon P. Chase, the fiscally conservative Treasury secretary, was mortally afraid of inflation. He recognized that without revenue the government would have to resort to the printing press. After the southern states seceded, interest rates on the country’s debt soared and foreigners refused to lend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Thaddeus Stevens, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, went further than Mr. Chase imagined by inventing an entirely new tax code. Previously, the Union had funded itself with tariffs on foreign trade, which it raised several times. Alongside that it created a system of “internal taxes,” on everything from personal income to leaf tobacco, liquor, slaughtered hogs and fees on auctioneers. Congress also created a new bureau to collect taxes, a forerunner of the Internal Revenue Service, underscoring its commitment to raising revenue this way., Mr. Stevens had no idea how much revenue the taxes would raise, or if people would even pay them. (“Everything on the earth and under the earth is to be taxed,” one Ohioan groused.) But by 1865, the Treasury netted $300 million from customs and internal taxes — six times its prewar tax revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , That revenue helped moderate the inflation created by the issuance of “greenbacks,” notes that circulated as money, to pay for the war. The country’s credit improved and Mr. Chase was able to borrow prodigious sums. Ultimately, inflation in the Union was no greater than during the two World Wars in the following century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Confederacy faced similar financial challenges. Christopher Memminger, its German-born Treasury secretary, warned that printing notes was “the most dangerous of all methods of raising money.” But the South was ideologically opposed to taxation, especially by the central government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The South approved a very modest tax (half a percent on real estate), but collection was left to the states and few tried to collect it. With cotton shipments to Europe pinched by the Union blockade, Mr. Memminger soon found he had little choice but to print notes to cover the cost of the war. These inflated at a catastrophic rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The military governor of Richmond imposed price controls — an old idea that has gained renewed attention recently — but farmers refused to sell food at the stipulated prices and the controls were dropped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , During the first nine months of 1863, the Confederacy reported revenue of $600 million, of which only $5 million was generated by taxes. (Most of the rest was printed notes.) When the government belatedly acknowledged the need for revenue, it turned to so-called in-kind taxes, such as by seizing crops from farmers, which was extremely unpopular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The South eventually imposed a 5 percent tax in 1864 on land, slaves and other property, but it was too little too late. The government printed so many notes it ran out of supplies and printed them on wallpaper. As the war wound down, instead of shuttling cartloads of notes around the streets, people exchanged cotton, bacon and salted pork for goods and services; their money was worthless.                                                                                                                                                                      , The economic experience of the Civil War went far beyond anything facing the United States today. Decisive action from the Fed may yet cool inflation, despite government spending, trade disruptions and war. Raising taxes remains politically unpopular, but the lessons of history suggest that when inflation gets uncomfortably high, the country’s fiscal stewards have an important role to play.                                                                                                                                                                     , Roger Lowenstein is the author of seven books, most recently “Ways and Means: Lincoln and His Cabinet and the Financing of the Civil War.” He is a former contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine and a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal. He is also a director of the Sequoia Fund. He writes regularly here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , What do you think?

It was kind of a joke between the two of them, Mr. Abu Sarah said recently. But the two friends — one a Palestinian who grew up in Jerusalem, the other an American Jew — had worked together in international conflict mediation and resolution in places like Syria, Afghanistan and Colombia. Feeling limited by the number of people they could reach through that work, Mr. Abu Sarah and Mr. Cooper decided to apply their experience in a completely different realm: tourism. Their goal was nothing less than to transform travel — and travelers — into a force for peace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , A defining feature of the tour company they founded in 2009 is the “dual narrative” tour, in which a group of tourists is led by two guides: one from either side of a longstanding conflict or division that has affected the area that the group is visiting. On the company’s tour of Ireland and Northern Ireland, for example, a Unionist and a Nationalist jointly lead the tour of sites around Belfast, Derry and Dublin. And on their tour of the Holy Land, the groups visit Tel Aviv, Bethlehem and Jerusalem accompanied by both a Palestinian Arab and an Israeli Jew.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Literally, everyone we knew told us this was the dumbest idea,” Mr. Abu Sarah said recently from his home in South Carolina. “They thought that nobody would ever pay to do something like this. But within a year, we proved them wrong.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , More than a decade after its founding, Mejdi Tours has hosted over 20,000 guests, and the company now runs trips to the Balkans, Colombia, Egypt, Morocco, Chile and Costa Rica, among other places. Meanwhile, Mr. Abu Sarah has been named a TED Fellow and a National Geographic Emerging Explorer. He has also written a book that makes the case for travel as a force for peace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The company’s tours have been mostly on hold during the pandemic, but Mr. Abu Sarah and Mr. Cooper used the downtime to develop or expand several new trips in the United States, including a history-of-civil-rights tour of the U.S. South, an Indigenous tour of the U.S. Southwest, and “Red/Blue Divide tours” of Washington, D.C., and Detroit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , When I reached him, Mr. Abu Sarah was about to head off to lead a group tour in Egypt. But he took the time to talk about the danger of the single narrative, the power of bringing together opposing perspectives, and what he learned from the hardest trip he’s ever taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In so many places that Scott and I had traveled to, we always came across a single dominant narrative, and then there were all these other narratives that were never given a voice in the public sphere. So with our tours, we thought: “No more single story. No more single narrative.” We decided to start in Jerusalem, Palestine and Israel, because Scott is Jewish and I’m Palestinian, and that’s the area we knew the best. And what we’ve seen is that the dual narrative is so powerful because it gives you the opportunity to hear different opinions, but also to understand the people you meet, to understand their fear and their anger, and to really fall in love with the place you’re visiting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , It’s extremely rare. If there are conflicts, it’s personality oriented, which you would see on any group tour. We have very conservative people and very liberal people coming on the same trips, but because these two guides with different backgrounds are able to hold a conversation, that somehow helps the group to hold these conversations, as well, without starting to fight. So we almost never have a problem between the guests themselves — or between the guides, which was the other worry people had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , I used to live in Washington, D.C., which is a very segregated city, especially on a class level, and I realized that my friends and I wouldn’t venture out of the neighborhoods we already knew. So we started to develop a tour of the city, and we got a Republican and a Democrat to colead it. That first trip was incredible. Watching the news, you would think that if you put a Republican and a Democrat together, they would just talk past each other. But that wasn’t the case at all. One of the most interesting conversations we had was on a visit to the Heritage Foundation, which is very conservative. Some of the liberal people in the tour group had never had this kind of open conversation with a conservative that wasn’t just sound bites, but a real, productive conversation. By the end of it, the discussion was about “What’s the solution?” rather than “You’re doing this wrong or that wrong.” It was fascinating. And that’s what happens on our tours in Israel and Palestine. That’s what happens in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia., I grew up in Jerusalem, but I never had a real conversation with a Jewish-Israeli person until I was 18 years old. My brother was killed by being beaten up in prison by Israeli soldiers, so I grew up very angry, very much with the idea that the other is evil. And then when I was 18, I decided to study Hebrew because I had to — not because I wanted to. Living in Jerusalem, you can’t survive without Hebrew. I remember walking into the class thinking, “None of these people probably want me to be here.” And I couldn’t have been more wrong. My Hebrew teacher was the most incredible human being. She even tried to speak Arabic to me to make me feel welcome. And that was the first time I felt like I was treated like a human being by the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But before that moment, I only knew one narrative of Israel, and many Israelis probably only know one narrative of Palestinians: the one they hear in the news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , I think it can be much easier to be open to learning about issues or problems that are happening five or six thousand miles away. Often when I talk about my work with Syrian refugees, people will say, “Oh, I would like to go and volunteer with Syrian refugees in Jordan or Turkey.” And I ask them, “Have you volunteered with Syrian refugees in your own community? Because if not, you should start there, and then maybe go to Syria.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Looking ahead. As governments across the world loosen coronavirus restrictions, the travel industry hopes this will be the year that travel comes roaring back. Here is what to expect:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Air travel. Many more passengers are expected to fly compared to last year. You’ll still need to check the latest entry requirements, and wear a mask for now. But more destinations will be within reach as countries reopen to tourists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Lodging. During the pandemic, many travelers discovered the privacy offered by rental residences. Hotels hope to compete again by offering stylish extended-stay properties, sustainable options, rooftop bars and co-working spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Rental cars. Travelers can expect higher prices, and older cars with high mileage, since companies still haven’t been able to expand their fleets. Seeking an alternative? Car-sharing platforms might be a more affordable option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Cruises. Despite a bumpy start to the year, thanks to Omicron’s surge, demand for cruises remains high. Luxury expedition voyages are particularly appealing right now, because they typically sail on smaller ships and steer away from crowded destinations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Destinations. Cities are officially back: Travelers are eager to dive into the sights, bites and sounds of a metropolis like Parisor New York. For a more relaxing time, some resorts in the U.S. are pioneering an almost all-inclusive model that takes the guesswork out of planning a vacation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Experiences. Travel options centered around sexual wellness (think couples retreats and beachfront sessions with intimacy coaches) are growing popular. Trips with an educational bent, meanwhile, are increasingly sought after by families with children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , We tend to think of travel in terms of distance, but I think travel is really a lifestyle, a state of mind. And if you learn to travel in your own community, you’ll learn to travel when you go abroad. For me, the hardest trip I ever took was going from my home in East Jerusalem to West Jerusalem. It’s just a 15- or 20-minute walk, but making that trip brought about the biggest change for me, because it challenged me the most.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , There’s an assumption that when people travel, they’re not interested in learning. And that’s not true. Even surveys tell us it’s not true. People want to do good as they travel, and they are looking for culture and connection. I have fun in my travels: I go see museums, I swim in the ocean, I enjoy music, all of that. But that’s not all that I do. I like to say that travel is an act of diplomacy: Be a diplomat as you’re traveling and go out and meet someone new and hear their stories. And it’s so much fun! It’s the thing that you will remember, and that you’ll tell people about when you come back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Paige McClanahan is the host of The Better Travel Podcast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

"As we say in Ukraine, ‘It’s better to lose money with a smart person than to try to earn money with an idiot.'", He also said that Western nations should take a "step back" and look at the decisions made with Russian energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                , PUTIN APPEARS AT MASSIVE MOSCOW RALLY, PRAISES RUSSIAN MILITARY: LIVE UPDATES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures while speaking to employees of the Almazov National Medical Center in St.Petersburg, Russia, Friday, March 16, 2018.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A Chinese vlogger shared videos of war-torn Ukraine. He's been labeled a national traitor - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Wang Jixian didn't set out to become the Chinese voice of resistance in Ukraine. The 36-year-old resident of Odesa, a key target in Russia's invasion of the country, simply wanted to show his parents he was fine.                                                                                                                                                , "I'm coming back from buying groceries," he said in a video posted to Douyin, China's version of TikTok, on February 24, the first day of the invasion. Wang, a programmer originally from Beijing, described buying meat and fruit in the video, remarking that some food stores were still open.                                                                        , But his mood darkened as the days passed and the Russian assault escalated. When he logged onto Douyin, he said he would see Chinese videos praising Russian troops or supporting the invasion.                                                                                                                                                                           , "I was very angry, then I thought I would record videos for them, and I'll tell them what the real battlefield is," he told CNN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , His daily videos, posted across various platforms including YouTube and the Chinese messaging app WeChat, quickly gained traction as a rare voice offering Chinese audiences a glimpse into war-torn Ukraine -- a stark contrast from Chinese state media, which has promoted Russian disinformation such as unfounded claims Ukrainian soldiers are using "Nazi" tactics.,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , In one widely-watched video, Wang held up his Chinese passport and said, "These Ukrainian guards are not Nazis, they are IT programmers, common people, barbers -- these are the people."                                                                                                                                                                                 , But in doing so, he had waded into the middle of a messy controversy, with China facing international pressure as it refuses to condemn Russia's invasion, and an outpouring of pro-Russia sentiment on China's highly restricted and censored social media -- something Wang is hoping to change.                                                                        , Backlash of critics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Wang had studied art in college, and enjoyed dance, music and painting -- so when he moved to Odesa four years ago for work, the city's "artistic atmosphere" immediately appealed to him. One video on his Douyin account last year showed a man playing piano in a colorful room filled with books and paintings.                                                       , His videos look very different now. Several are filmed late at night, with the sound of explosions and air raid sirens in the background. Other clips show snapshots of daily life -- quiet streets, Ukrainian flags hung outside buildings and painted onto walls.                                                                                                       ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Are those air raid alarms? Those bastards are coming again," he said in one video. "People are doing their own business, my neighbor is out walking his dog again. This is our Odesa."                                                                                                                                                                                   , Other times, he's more impassioned. "Someone told me nowadays, society has the laws of the jungle, where power comes from the barrel of a gun," he said, referencing a famous quote by Communist leader Mao Zedong. "Where is the sense in that?"                                                                                                                         , As these videos began garnering attention, sometimes racking up more than 140,000 views, the number of critics rose too, with comments calling him a national traitor.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "You don't need this Chinese passport anymore, you have already forgotten which country you are from," one popular comment on Douyin read. "The official position of the country should be the position of all Chinese people."                                                                                                                                           , China has tried to stake out a neutral position, choosing not to condemn Russia or even call it an invasion while frequently saying "all countries' legitimate security concerns" should be addressed.                                                                                                                                                                    , In a call with US President Joe Biden on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said both countries have a responsibility for ensuring peace. But the White House said afterward it was still concerned China could provide Russia assistance.                                                                                                                              , "I don't understand how I 'betrayed' the country," Wang told CNN. With limited access to news broadcasts and widespread online misinformation, he said he doesn't understand China's or Russia's position -- all he knew was that "every day the city is under fire, many were killed."                                                                                   , The comments of anonymous online strangers don't bother him -- but they do when it's from people he cares about, such as a Chinese Embassy staff member he knew from his previous residence in North Macedonia.                                                                                                                                                           , He said the staffer reached out to him recently, insinuating Wang was being paid to post his videos, and asking: "Who sent you?" When Wang insisted he wasn't doing it for money, the staffer replied: "Your current behavior is not in line with national interests. I want to cut off relations with you, let's block each other."                                      , That "really hurt my heart," Wang said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Determined to stay                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Chinese censors have also cracked down on his videos online, he said. While all his videos have stayed up on YouTube, which is blocked in China except for those with VPNs, only about 80% of his videos have been left on WeChat, and fewer than 20% on Douyin.                                                                                                          , He doesn't know what rules he has broken. He got so frustrated that in one video on March 7, he stuck black tape in an X over his mouth, silently gesturing to the camera to convey that he was safe and still in Odesa.                                                                                                                                                  , After speaking with CNN, his Chinese social media accounts were banned, leaving him unable to contact his family back home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , He has received "countless" messages from contacts, placing pressure on him to stop posting, he said. But he has no intention of doing so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "I want to (provide) some voice for the people in Ukraine, for the heroes, for my neighbors. Because in my eyes they are all heroes," he said. "I see people being calm, I see people brave ... I want to remind you to see who is dying, who has been killed."                                                                                                           , There are signs his message may be landing. Under his videos, hate comments are interspersed with well wishes from viewers, urging him to stay safe and evacuate. A handful of comments express support for Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                      , But for now, Wang has no intention of leaving -- not until "Odesa is too destroyed for humans to stay," he said. Apart from his affection for the city, it was a matter of principle, he added: "I can't stand the act of bullying people in front of my face."                                                                                                           , When he isn't filming videos, Wang provides volunteer support in repairing people's cell phones and assisting the displaced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "(If) I turned back and left, it would be enough to make me regret for the rest of my life," he said. "I have no interest or desire to leave Ukraine until the war is ended and Ukraine has won."                                                                                                                                                                         , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cost of living: Calls for targeted help to cut energy bills </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Millions of people face the dilemma of cutting spending on food and clothing to pay their energy bill, one supplier's boss has said.                                                                                                                                           , Bill Bullen, chief executive of Utilita - which serves prepayment meter customers - said government financial support was not directed sufficiently to those who needed it most.                                                                                               , He said ministers should spend money on "insulating the hell out of Britain".                                                                                                                                                                                                  , There are growing calls for help on bills ahead of the Spring Statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the statement - an update on the state of the UK economy, and an opportunity to outline further policies on tackling the rising cost of living.                                                                              , The government is also preparing a UK energy strategy in light of the war in Ukraine and the impact it is having on global supply and prices.                                                                                                                                  , Millions of households are facing a 54% rise in the cost of a typical annual gas and electricity bill, to about £2,000, when the regulator's new, higher price cap takes effect on 1 April.                                                                                    , The price rise for prepayment meter customers, who can include some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society, is slightly higher. The increase for prepayment meter customers is typically £708 a year.                                                                   , The war in Ukraine has heightened concern about a similar increase in October, when the next cap is set.                                                                                                                                                                       , The government has said it is taking "decisive action" in helping people with their bills. This includes a £150 council tax rebate for 80% of households, followed by a £200 discount on bills in October which will need to be repaid.                                        , However, Mr Bullen argued that the rise was inadequately focussed, leaving millions of people facing tough choices on their family budgets.                                                                                                                                    , "They just do not have the money," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , He said that the "path of no regret" for the government was to find ways to cut energy consumption, and therefore bills, over the long term with a massive home insulation programme. It was relatively easy, he said, to cut consumption by 20%.                              , Some people who agree with the criticism of a non-targeted approach to the government's financial assistance have chosen to donate their £150 council rebate to charities helping those struggling to pay their fuel bills.                                                    , National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm, dry homes and runs a helpline and hardship funds, said that 40% of its donations in February came from people wishing to donate their rebate.                                                                                , Ahead of the Spring Statement, a string of charities have called on the chancellor to step up support for those struggling to pay their bills, given the rising cost of basics such as food and fuel.                                                                          , The debt charity Christians Against Poverty said calls to its helpline went up by 47% in January compared with the same month last year. It said requests for emergency fuel vouchers had doubled in the first two months of this year compared with the same period last year., As well as a more generous increase in benefit payments, the charity wants the chancellor to announce a full review of the cost of living to ensure everyone has a sufficient income for their basic needs.                                                                    , Citizens Advice estimated that five million people would be unable to afford the April energy price rise. The prospect of more price rises in October could mean that one in four UK adults would be unable to pay their bills.                                                , The Joseph Rowntree Foundation argued that the minimum requirement from the chancellor to tackle the cost of living issue was to increase benefits in line with inflation - close to doubling the 3.1% increase set for April.                                                 , There's something for everyone on BBC iPlayer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , An astonishing story of deadly bacteria, government tests, and a shady protest group...                                                                                                                                                                                        , Stanley Tucci travels across Italy to discover the country’s cuisine and culture                                                                                                                                                                                               , © 2022 BBC.

The ferry company said it was aiming to have the first ones "running again in the next day or two as we lose £1m a day for each day they are not moving".                                                                                                                                                               , A Department for Transport spokesperson could not provide details on the current value of government contracts awarded to P&amp;O Ferries, but Labour Party analysis of the public sector contracts database Tussle found the company had received £38.3m in taxpayer-funded contracts since December 2018. One government contract for freight between Tilbury and Zeebrugge for nine months was worth £10.9m., Mr Shapps urged the company to pause the redundancies announced and instructed the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to inspect all vessels to make sure replacement crews "rushed through" were safe to go to sea.                                                                                                                                                                                           , He has also asked the Insolvency Service to look at the laws around notification requirements to see if P&amp;O followed correct and legal processes so the government "can consider if further action is appropriate".                                                                                                                                                                                        , Protests have been staged in Dover, Liverpool, Hull and elsewhere in the UK against the P&amp;O redundancies, while the vessels stay docked at ports and ferry cancellations cause travel disruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has also written to the ferry operator's chief executive demanding answers to P&amp;O Ferries' handling of the redundancies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr Kwarteng's letter to its boss Peter Hebblethwaite says the company "appears to have failed" to follow the correct process for making large-scale redundancies, which would include consulting with unions and staff representatives and notifying him through the Insolvency Service and the Redundancy Payment Service.                                                                                , The letter says failure to notify is "a criminal offence and can lead to an unlimited fine".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr Kwarteng's questions to P&amp;O Ferries include asking for details on the exact number of redundancies and how many of these involved any consultation, as well as the location of work for each staff member dismissed.                                                                                                                                                                                    , Additionally, he asked if staff made redundant were offered alternative roles directly for P&amp;O Ferries or similar roles on new terms and conditions through an agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Workers have spoken of their "utter dismay" after hearing the news and of feeling abandoned by the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Andrew Smith, who had worked for the company for 22 years, said: "It's our lives. It's how our families have grown up, knowing that this is what we do, and it's just been turned on its head within a matter of hours."                                                                                                                                                                                   , And James, who has worked for P&amp;O Ferries in Dover for about four years, said all he received "was a three minute pre-recorded message saying we are out of a job.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> P&amp;O Ferries' job cuts a 'PR disaster', say experts </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> P&amp;O Ferries may save money by laying off 800 workers and replacing them with cheaper agency staff but it's come at a huge cost to its brand, experts warn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "It's the worst example of how to treat employees I've seen in more than 30 years of doing crisis communications," says Stuart Bruce, who advises companies on their PR strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In just a few hours the company became a case study in how not to handle a difficult situation, experts say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , P&amp;O said cuts were needed to survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "The plan seemed to be: Sack 800 staff with immediate effect by three-minute video message; manhandle those who refuse leave their posts (using handcuffs if necessary); leave customers stranded in various ports because there's no one to crew ships; and replace all staff with cheap labour in a few weeks. What could possibly go wrong?" says Kate Hartley, author of "How to Communicate in a Crisis". , P&amp;O Ferries on Friday said none of its people were directed to use handcuffs nor force and  it "offered enhanced severance terms to those affected to properly and promptly compensate them for the lack of warning and consultation".                                                                                                                                                                         , However, Ms Hartley, who co-founded social media crisis management firm Polpeo, said there's an old adage in the world of PR - that you can't communicate your way out a crisis that you behaved your way into - and that P&amp;O has behaved its way into one of the worst corporation crises she has seen in recent years.                                                                                       , P&amp;O Ferries is owned by Dubai logistics giant DP World which is, in turn, controlled by the Dubai sovereign wealth fund.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazil’s 10-year government bond yield rose above 12.3%, not far from the 2-1/2-year high of 12.4% touched on March 14th after better than expected labor data added to projections of monetary tightening. The figure came after the Central Bank of Brazil increased the Selic rate by 100bps on its March meeting and signaled another 100bps for its next meeting. Meanwhile, investors continue to monitor state-backed oil company Petrobras and its gasoline pricing strategy amid high volatility in crude oil markets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> When Olia Hercules first saw what was happening in Ukraine she went through a rollercoaster of emotions. The chef and author, has lived in the UK for the last 20 years but was born and raised in Ukraine and still has family there.                                                                                   , "I've had really dark days, when I didn't want to live.

Instead it is the headquarters of a fundraising campaign to send protective equipment to Ukraine's soldiers, including her brother, Sasha, who has joined the fight to defend the country.                    , When the fighting first spread to southern Ukraine, where Olia's family is from, Sasha told her he was going to try to head for Lviv in the western part of the country. But, his plans quickly changed.                                                                                                                 , "He messaged me, and he said that he's not going to leave, that the situation is extremely desperate, and that he needs to go and join the territorial defences," Olia says.                                                                                                                                             , "But he realised that when you join, you're only given a rifle and that's it. There was no protective gear, there were no helmets, no protective vests, not even kneepads.

The Chinese President emphasized that war in Ukraine is in no-one’s interest, momentarily easing concerns that China could assist Russia with military equipment. Atlantia (3.6%) extended yesterday’s gains as investors continued to assess Italy’s competition authority’s approval of the sale of Autostrade per l’Italia in a deal worth over EUR 8 billion. At the same time, STMicroelectronics gained 2.9%, tracking higher semiconductor producers worldwide after China announced it would aid market conditions this week. Italy’s benchmark equity index closed the week over 5% higher. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , High gasoline prices are impacting all American drivers — but low-income households bear the brunt of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , That's because low earners funnel a bigger share of their budgets to transportation costs and other staples, like food and energy, relative to wealthier households.                                                                                                                                                                                               , U.S. gas prices had jumped to $4.32 a gallon, on average, as of March 14, up more than $1 a gallon from the beginning of 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.                                                                                                                                                                            , The war in Ukraine has led already high oil prices to spike, trickling down to consumers at the pump, though prices have fallen a bit from recent highs.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "You're seeing a lot of poor people — especially the rural poor driving a lot — getting hit harder," said Kent Smetters, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania and faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model.                                                                                                                                     , Federal data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics bears out this pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , In 2019, Americans spent 3.3% of their budgets (almost $2,100) on gasoline, motor oil and other fuels, on average. (Gasoline accounts for more than 90% of this category, Smetters said.)                                                                                                                                                                          , But those with $30,000 to $40,000 of annual pre-tax income spent a larger portion (4.1%) of their budgets at the pump, on average — about $1,700 total.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Gasoline spending as a share of annual expenditures skews downward as income grows, data show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , For example, gasoline costs accounted for 2% of overall spending for those with more than $200,000 of income, on average. That's half the share of the $30,000-$40,000 group. (The dollar total amount of spending was nearly double, at $3,300).                                                                                                                  , (While 2020 federal data was the latest available, 2019 statistics offer a more accurate analysis since the pandemic distorted gasoline consumption, Smetters said.)                                                                                                                                                                                               , The gasoline-spending trend may not seem readily apparent for the lowest earners. For example, those with less than $15,000 of annual income spent 3.7% of their budgets on gas in 2019, on average — the same share as households earning $70,000 to $100,000 a year.                                                                                             , However, that dynamic results from car ownership. Low earners own fewer cars, on average, and therefore fewer of those households use gasoline, skewing down the group's average expenditures.                                                                                                                                                                     , More from Personal Finance:Americans are pausing investments because of the Russia-Ukraine war46% of taxpayers plan to save their refunds this yearTax return backlog will 'absolutely' clear by end of 2022: IRS commissioner                                                                                                                                     , "The $15,000 [group] is low-income enough that a lot of them live in urban areas and do not own a car," Smetters said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Just 61% of households in the lowest-income group own or lease a vehicle, as do 82% of those with $15,000 to $30,000 of income. More than 90% of other households own a vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                                   , Higher earners also have more cars, on average. The lowest earners own or lease one vehicle, on average, while those earning more than $100,000 a year have nearly three.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Some may view a 2-percentage-point difference between high and low earners in the share of annual gasoline outlays as negligible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , However, here's one way to think about that difference: It's about equal to the amount of money that lower-income households spend on meats, poultry, fish and eggs, Smetters said.                                                                                                                                                                                , "Put differently, if lower-income households could spend the same share on gas (and other fuels) as higher-income households, then lower-income households could double their intake of these proteins," Smetters said.                                                                                                                                            , The 2019 expenditure data is a good indicator of spending but doesn't necessarily reflect household expenses in the current environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Households may adjust to higher prices by driving less to limit the dent on their wallets. (That's not possible for everyone though, especially those who drive to work and can't work from home; low earners are less likely than wealthier Americans to be able to work remotely.)                                                                               , The sticker price for gasoline hit an all-time this month. However, it's not a record high when accounting for inflation over the decades — most recently, prices at the pump were higher in 2008, 2011 and 2012, when gasoline topped out at about $5.31, $4.98 and $4.86 a gallon in today's dollars, respectively, according to a CNBC analysis of federal data., Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The pan-European STOXX 600 rose on Friday to end the week more than 5% higher, notching its second straight week of gains and the best weekly performance since November 2020. The market moves came as investors digested interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England while following negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. On the corporate side, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall gained almost 5% after UBS, Deutsche Bank, and HSBC raised their target prices for its shares. Interroll and Bachem Holding both plunged more than 9% after their earnings report. Domestically, the benchmark DAX 30 finished the week around the 14,400 level and posted its second weekly gain. </td>

Unable to adhere to the mainland’s zero-Covid strategy, Hong Kong officials have provided inconsistent and conflicting details on how the city will deal with its current outbreak.                                            , Now some fear the government’s failure to get the virus under control has accelerated Beijing’s creeping authority over the semiautonomous Chinese territory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Since the outbreak began, China has flooded Hong Kong with what it sees as necessary reinforcements, including donations of traditional Chinese medicine and protective medical gear. Chinese epidemiologists were sent to advise health officials, and more than a thousand technicians and health care workers have been dispatched for testing and patient care.                                                                                                                                                            , A temporary bridge has been erected to connect Hong Kong to the Chinese city of Shenzhen in order to move supplies and manpower more quickly. Dozens of construction workers have been sent in to build temporary government quarantine facilities and makeshift hospitals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Many of Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing politicians have been quick to thank “the motherland” for its assistance. John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief secretary for administration, equated the outbreak to the 2019 pro-democracy protests that led to a sweeping crackdown from Beijing and helped usher in the National Security Law.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “Whenever Hong Kong found it difficult to overcome on our own the very huge difficulties which exceeded our capabilities, the Country would provide us with the strongest and the most reliable backing,” Mr. Lee wrote in the China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by the Communist Party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Others see the intervention as the latest sign that the city is being brought irreversibly under the yoke of Beijing, despite promises that it would retain a degree of independence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “The Hong Kong people are very unhappy about Carrie Lam and the government because their incompetence has given the central government an excuse to step in and take more control,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Some of the policy indecision from Mrs. Lam and other officials has at times appeared to be a reaction to mounting pressure from the mainland. When cases jumped in mid-February and overburdened hospitals began treating patients on gurneys on the sidewalk, Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, warned Hong Kong officials to “make controlling the epidemic as soon as possible an overwhelming priority.”                                                                                                                    , Several days later, Mrs. Lam announced a plan to test every single resident starting in March. The city waited for more details that never came. Instead, Hong Kong’s health secretary said the government could not rule out a lockdown to accompany mass testing, contradicting earlier statements from Mrs. Lam.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , With few details to hang on to and fearing the kind of lockdowns that have left people stranded at home with little food on the mainland, many Hong Kong residents rushed to buy essentials from grocery stores. As a sense of unease sank in, Mrs. Lam stopped giving regular news conferences. The criticism from her fellow pro-Beijing colleagues grew more pointed as the fatality rate from the virus among older people, a large number of whom are unvaccinated in Hong Kong, soared to among the highest in the world., “The whole approach of the government has seemed to be chaotic,” said Lau Siu-kai, a Hong Kong scholar who advises Beijing on policy. “The objective to be achieved is not clear, and the tactic used seems to be unstable and changeable.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “You can see all the complaints around Hong Kong these days,” he added. “It makes Beijing worried.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Mrs. Lam reappeared in front of the media last week with a promise to communicate better to the public through daily news conferences. But when asked for more details about mass testing, she said she had none. A day later, when asked again, an exasperated Mrs. Lam scolded a reporter for “unnecessarily” taking up time.                                                                                                                                                                                                , “People like Carrie Lam and other Hong Kong officials are always anticipating Beijing’s wishes,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor of politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Beijing’s imprimatur is now more important than local public opinion for many leading Hong Kong officials.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Beijing’s crackdown on pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong and a new “patriots only” city legislature has ensured that any dissenting voices in the once freewheeling city have been silenced. Many people have been at a loss to understand swings in policy decisions now made behind closed doors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , As one example, Hong Kong has kept a ban on airlines that bring in four or more passengers who test positive for the virus, but the daily local case count is already in the tens of thousands, and some of the countries that are banned have fewer cases. Still, officials continue to emphasize the need to send those who test positive into government quarantine centers, even though Hong Kong has now recorded more than a million cases.                                                                              , Researchers estimate that half of the population in Hong Kong may have already been infected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “We feel really confused and frustrated and tired of all these so-called new policies,” said Yvonne Kai, a 46-year-old baker in Hong Kong’s busy Wan Chai district. “Different people tell us different policies every day.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , She added, “I’m feeling like we can’t trust the government.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Last week, as officials worried about the capacity at public mortuaries and a shortage of coffins, the government suddenly announced that hair salons would reopen while bars, gyms, outdoor playgrounds and schools remained shuttered. Regina Ip, a lawmaker and adviser to Mrs. Lam, applauded the decision on Twitter.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “I urge the government to reopen also golf courses, tennis courts and other facilities for no-contact sports,” Mrs. Ip wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Yet when Mrs. Lam addressed the local press on Monday, she seemed no closer to providing clarity on the city’s virus policies. Instead, she appeared to have a message for the Chinese officials who recently locked down millions of citizens in neighboring Shenzhen after discovering hundreds of coronavirus cases there.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “If you want us to follow what Shenzhen is doing,” Mrs. Lam said, “I’m afraid we are not up to it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , On Thursday, Mrs. Lam told the media that she would also review many of the city’s tough social distancing rules. As she spoke, tall barriers were being erected at public beaches as part of measures she had promised to avoid just days earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “I have a very strong feeling that people’s tolerance is fading,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Analyst tracks 11 states looking at adult use cannabis sales - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Alliance Global Partners analyst Aaron Grey said he's tracked 11 U.S. states considering adult use cannabis sales, despite a lack of progress on the federal level. "While questions around the prospects for federal cannabis reform remain, state by state momentum continues," Grey said in a research note. Connecticut, New York, Virginia and New Jersey are expected to also begin adult-use sales through 2023-2024, he said. "We believe this momentum will continue for years to come."

Mullen hopes to have its Mullen Five, an electric crossover, for sale this year and has said it has a made "progress" on solid-state battery technology.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Are the P&amp;O Ferries sackings legal? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> P&amp;O Ferries has been criticised by politicians and unions after announcing in a video call that 800 staff were being sacked with immediate effect.                                                                                                                 , A cross-party group of MPs has condemned the company's action as "callous" and "disgraceful".

It should be two-way process where the employees have the opportunity to put forward alternatives to that enforced termination and none of that has happened. So is it a fair process? No, based on that alone.", Ms Connolly says a problem in such cases is that any action by the workers is "very much after the horse has bolted". Staff would have to wait months on average for an outcome.                                                                                   , She points out staff would have no jobs potentially during the claim period and would have to pay legal costs even if they win their case, although unions might help with those.                                                                                  , However, the fact that P&amp;O's owners, DP World, are based in Dubai, should not affect employees making a case for wrongful dismissal, according to Ms Connolly.                                                                                                     , She says that under UK employment law, workers' rights are based on the "jurisdiction from which you work" - in other words, because they work in the UK, they are covered by UK law.                                                                              , If this wasn't the case, she says, companies could just register themselves abroad and employment law could be ignored.                                                                                                                                            , An employer seeking to make 100 or more people redundant must notify the Business Secretary 45 days before letting staff go.                                                                                                                                       , Downing Street has said it received no prior warnings from P&amp;O, although it is understood senior officials in the Department for Transport were informed on Wednesday of P&amp;O's intentions.                                                                         , According to the government's website, failure to comply with the rule "may result in prosecution and a fine, on summary conviction, for the company and/or officer of the company".                                                                               , Armed forces minister James Heappey called P&amp;O's actions "disgraceful" but told Sky News that the government "cannot force an employer to continue to employ people that the employer has said it doesn't want to employ."                                         , "It's relatively uncommon that an employer would side-step all of the procedural steps that you should take before even contemplating a mass sacking of this nature," says Ms Connolly.                                                                            , Nathan Donaldson, a solicitor at Keystone Law, says the approach adopted by P&amp;O is "not unheard of", but agrees with Ms Connolly that it is "exceptional to forego appropriate notice and consultation processes".                                                 , Mr Donaldson says a government review of "fire and re-hire"- where employers dismiss some of their workers and hire them back straight away on worse deals - did not outlaw the practice, but emphasised "that it should be a process of last resort".             , Chris Deeley, of JMW Solicitors, says other businesses might look at P&amp;O's actions and "consider taking similar steps" to save costs and avoid lengthy consultation processes.                                                                                     , "However, P&amp;O's actions - committing what seem to be flagrant breaches of employment law, and simply paying off employees to overlook them - is not an example we would advise any employer to follow."                                                            , P&amp;O Ferries has not responded to the BBC's request for comment regarding suggestions it might have breached UK employment law.                                                                                                                                     , However, in a statement, the company admits that the redundancies came "without warning or prior consultation" and "that this has caused distress for [staff] and their families".                                                                                 , It says that the decision was taken "as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options" because the company could not have survived otherwise.                                                                                               , P&amp;O claims that reaching agreement on the way forward  with workers "would be impossible" and the process would be highly disruptive, "not just for the business but for UK trade and tourism".                                                                    , It says it has offered "enhanced severance terms to those affected to properly and promptly compensate them for the lack of warning and consultation", and says these changes "bring us into line with standard industry practice".                                , There's something for everyone on BBC iPlayer                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , An astonishing story of deadly bacteria, government tests, and a shady protest group...                                                                                                                                                                            , Stanley Tucci travels across Italy to discover the country’s cuisine and culture                                                                                                                                                                                   , © 2022 BBC.

Across the country, office occupancy has hit a pandemic high, 40 percent, reached just once before in early December, at the same time that indoor mask mandates drop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , After several false starts in calling workers back, company leaders now seem eager to press forward. A flurry of return-to-office plans have rolled out in recent weeks, with businesses including American Express, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft calling some workers back to their desks. Many of those companies followed state and local governments in easing Covid-19 restrictions, arguing that ending mask mandates could make workplaces more pleasant. But some workers, especially those with compromised immunity or unvaccinated children, feel uncomfortable with the rush back to open floor plans.                             , “Masks have created a real psychological barrier to getting back to office culture,” said Kathryn Wylde, head of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. “As long as things are going in a positive direction with Covid, I think the relaxation of mandates will work for the vast majority of people. As soon as we see a reversal, I think we’ve got trouble.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Partnership’s January survey of New York City employers found that 38 percent expected to have more than half of their workers back in the office on an average weekday by late March. As employees come back, they’re facing a patchwork of Covid safety protocols. Just one-quarter of U.S. workers are covered by vaccine mandates in the workplace, according to Gallup data from last month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , This has left many workers to navigate masking on their own, making Covid safety measures a matter of office etiquette rather than protocol. Some have negotiated new remote work arrangements with their bosses as rules have eased, or even left their companies in search of jobs at workplaces that made them feel safer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “When the rules came out that you could drop your mask, many people were like, ‘Yay, we’re free,’” said Diane Rames, 65, an office administrator at a law firm in Oakland, Calif. “I was like, wait a minute — there isn’t a line in the sand that’s, like, it’s here today, gone tomorrow.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , At the law firm Paul, Weiss, a large event on March 10 was followed by multiple positive Covid test results. The firm notified attendees and conducted contact tracing. Paul, Weiss has required vaccines and boosters for everyone entering its offices and has not yet required a return to the office, though employees are encouraged to come in several days each week. Following local health guidelines, the firm no longer requires its workers to be masked in common areas in the office.                                                                                                                                                           , “The health and safety of all of our employees remains our highest priority,” said Brad Karp, the firm’s chairman. “We will continue to do everything possible within our control to ensure the continued health and safety of the Paul, Weiss community.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Wall Street has been quick to shift its Covid-19 protocols after New York State dropped its indoor mask mandate last month. At JPMorgan Chase, masks are now voluntary for vaccinated and unvaccinated employees, and the firm will discontinue mandatory Covid testing as well as the reporting of Covid infections by April 4. At Morgan Stanley, where vaccines are required to enter the office, the mask requirement was dropped early last month.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Goldman Sachs dropped mask requirements on Feb. 14, though it still requires testing. Citigroup dropped its mask requirement last week. Wells Fargo has maintained more rigid Covid protocols than some of its finance peers, requiring unvaccinated employees to wear a mask at all times unless they are eating, drinking or alone in an enclosed room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Other industries that have made a push for in-person work, such as real estate, have also reformulated their Covid guidelines in recent weeks. BlackRock, which has asked its 7,600 U.S. employees to return to the office at least three days a week, no longer requires masks in its U.S. offices, though employees have to be vaccinated to enter the building and are asked to test twice a week. Prologis, a logistics real estate firm, said its office mask guidelines were consistent with local regulations. Guardian Life Insurance, which has about 6,300 U.S. employees, does not have an in-office mask requirement in most areas of the country., Still, some tech companies are holding firm on Covid safety protocols. Google requires any unvaccinated employees with approval to enter its offices to test regularly and wear a mask. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, requires anyone entering the office to be vaccinated — including with a booster starting March 28 — and follows local guidelines on masking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Intuit announced on Wednesday that starting on May 16, its 11,500 U.S. employees would return to the office in a hybrid model, in which teams determine how many days per week workers should be in person. While the company requires anyone entering its offices to be vaccinated, it follows local and state guidelines on masking, meaning masks are not required in any of its U.S. offices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “We’ve tried to stress that people should feel comfortable doing whatever feels best for them,” said Chris Glennon, Intuit’s vice president of global real estate and workplace. “We are seeing some folks masking, particularly in public areas, but by and large most are not masking.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Nationwide Insurance, which has 25,000 U.S. employees, has instituted a hybrid model in which workers come to the office anywhere from one to five days every other week, though it says the office is never above 50 percent capacity. The company does not require vaccines and lifted its mask guidelines on March 2. Any employees who test positive for the virus after coming to the office are required to report their result so the company can do contact tracing.                                                                                                                                                                                  , At Jefferies, an investment bank in New York, masks are still required in office common areas. The company has embraced hybrid work, and on peak days, its office is almost back to its prepandemic occupancy rate of 70 percent. TIAA, an investment firm with a roughly 97 percent vaccination rate, no longer requires vaccinated workers to wear masks in common areas, except for where required by local regulations — but noted that it provided at-home molecular tests for employees.                                                                                                                                                                , For those tasked with developing office protocols on masking and vaccination, the easing of state and local government guidelines has brought a new set of challenges. Some said they struggled to appease colleagues who wanted looser policies while also maintaining an environment that feels safe. Those concerns mounted this week, as the BA.2 subvariant drives an uptick of Covid cases in Europe, possibly portending a similar rise in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ms. Rames, the office administrator in Oakland, recalled that the same week California dropped its indoor mask mandate, one of the partners at her law firm came in and removed all the office signs encouraging social distancing. Ms. Rames has often felt like the “Covid police” when she gently reminds colleagues to pull their masks over their noses and urges people to space themselves out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , She finds herself torn between the partners eager for a return to prepandemic office culture and employees like herself who are nervous about exposure to Covid-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “I understand Covid fatigue, but people don’t understand how crushing of a burden it is to try and keep everybody safe,” Ms. Rames said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Workers with children too young to be vaccinated have been especially hesitant to report back to their desks. Some companies have allowed caretakers to negotiate special accommodations for remote or hybrid work, an option that many working parents said they had embraced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “I have made it clear to my boss and several layers of bosses above me that I have no intention of returning to the office until my young kids are vaccinated,” said Greg Howard, 36, who works at a tech company and lives in Kirkland, Wash., with his children, a 4-year-old toddler and an infant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Some workers have even switched jobs in pursuit of safer working environments. Saskia Cervantes, 42, worked at a natural food company in Denver that started encouraging its employees to return to the office last April, as Covid vaccines became widely available. Masks were required by local regulations, but she found that most of her co-workers didn’t wear them. Ms. Cervantes, who is immunocompromised, felt out of place as one of few masked workers in the office.                                                                                                                                                                            , She moved companies in August, taking a pay cut, because she wanted to be at a business that allowed permanent remote work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “It was the kind of thing where you’d go into someone’s office and they’d say, ‘Are you comfortable with masks on or off?’” she recalled. “It was like, ‘Look at me, I’m wearing an N95.’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , For many employers, there’s a sense that they know what is required to keep businesses open and workers safe, having weathered the Omicron and Delta surges. And having revised their return-to-office date several times, they’d like to stick to their plans. But they also recognize that as restrictions loosen, they’ll need to keep a sharp eye on fluctuations in Covid case rates, especially with some people ready to walk if safety standards aren’t maintained and remote work isn’t an option.                                                                                                                                                   , “We’ve gone from guarded optimism to a more confident certainty,” said Mr. Glennon, of Intuit, though he added that the company was staying vigilant in monitoring the state of the virus. “It’s going to take quite some time until everybody feels that we’re beyond this.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Advertisement </td>

Gas prices are making it harder to travel across Washington State like they used to.                                   , SEATTLE – Food truck vendors who cover their own gas are desperately trying to stay afloat amid record prices.                                                                                                              , Zaytoona Food Truck owner Muhammad Al Deri has started setting up in down Seattle a lot more over the past couple of months.

Skyrocketing gas prices are making it harder to find those spots.   , "We just can’t do it, because maybe they only have 20 people that show up," German said. "Unfortunately, I’ve got to do better than that just to stay afloat."                                                              , FED'S BULLARD SAYS INTEREST RATES NEED TO RISE ABOVE 3% TO QUELL INFLATION                                                                                                                                                  , So, German is setting up at events like fairs and festivals more often, but that means higher entrance fees and more competitors.                                                                                           , DEM COMMITTEE CHAIR CALLS OIL CEOS TO TESTIFY AMID GAS PRICE SPIKE                                                                                                                                                          , "Nothing is really guaranteed," German said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> China's Xi tells Biden that 'Ukraine crisis is not something we want to see': report - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Joe Biden during a Friday phone call that the world's prevailing trend of peace and development is facing serious challenges, according to a report from Xinhua, a Chinese state-run news agency. "The Ukraine crisis is not something we want to see," Xi said, according to the report. The Chinese leader also reportedly said conflict and confrontation are not in anyone's interest, peace and security are what the international community should treasure the most, and China and the U.S. should "work for world peace and tranquility." The call, which was expected to focus on Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, began at 9:03 a.m. Eastern and ended at 10:53 a.m. Eastern, according to the White House., More than 35 leaders are calling for an exception because of the extraordinary situation in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Victor Reklaitis is MarketWatch's Money &amp; Politics reporter and is based in Washington, D.C.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC on Friday that the central bank may need to enact one or more 50 basis point interest rate hikes this year to tame inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Though he voted this week for just a 25 basis point move due to uncertainty from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Waller said he thinks the Fed may need to be more aggressive soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "I really favor front-loading our rate hikes, that we need to do more withdrawal of accommodation now if we want to have an impact on inflation later this year and next year," he told CNBC's Steve Liesman during a "Squawk Box" interview. "So in that sense, the way to front-load it is to pull some rate hikes forward, which would imply 50 basis points at one or multiple meetings in the near future.", In addition to the rate hikes, Waller said he thinks the Fed needs to start reducing its bond holdings soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The central bank balance sheet has ballooned to just over $9 trillion, and officials are preparing the process to start rolling off some of their holdings. Waller said that process should start "in the next meeting or two."                                                                                                                                                                                 , "We're in a different place than we were before," he said. "We have a much bigger balance sheet, the economy's in a much different position. Inflation is raging. So, we're in a position where we could actually draw down a large amount of liquidity out of the system without really doing much damage."                                                                                                    , Waller's comments came less than two hours after one of his colleagues, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, said the Fed should raise rates in total at least 300 basis points this year. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.                                                                                                                                                                            , Bullard was the only policymaker this week to vote against the quarter-point increase, saying the Fed should have gone by half a point as part of a deliberate policy aimed at curbing inflation running at 40-year highs.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Before the meeting, Waller also had been pushing for a 50 basis point move, but said he had a change of heart for now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "The data's basically screaming at us to go 50, but the geopolitical events were telling you to go forward with caution," he said. "So those two factors combined pushed me off of advocating for a 50 basis point hike and supporting the 25-point hike that we enacted."                                                                                                                                      , The full Federal Open Market Committee also pointed to rate hikes that would push the benchmark fed funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight lending, to 1.75% by year's end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Waller said he believes the Fed should shoot a little higher than that. He did not specify by how much but said he thinks the "neutral rate" that is neither stimulative nor restrictive is between 2% and 2.25%, and the Fed should "try to be above that by the end of the year."                                                                                                                             , The rate hike approved this week was the Fed's first in more than three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Platinum futures rose above $1030 per tonne, rebounding from its 2-month low of $986 hit on March 15th, amid renewed supply concerns from Russia, the metal’s top exporter. Fears of further sanctions on Russia and consequent export disruptions reappeared after both Russia and Ukraine pointed to little progress in peace talks this week, even after the 4th round of negotiations. At the same time, demand for platinum is set to rise given its importance in petroleum refineries and the chemical industry. Also, it is a cheaper alternative to palladium in the production of autocatalysts. </td>

Volumes of gas flowing from Russia to Europe remain above pre-war levels as sanctions have so far excluded Russian natural gas imports. Gazprom said on Thursday it has continued gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine in line with requests from European consumers, while volumes flowing through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline declined. Meanwhile, high gas prices in Europe are rerouting LNG trade flows, with Chinese Unipec selling LNG cargoes in Europe via a tender. Also, the US Department of Energy issued approvals allowing more LNG exports to countries without free trade agreements, such as European nations, as the region remained the top importer. On a weekly basis, the contract is set for a 22.7% slump. </td>

Considering January, retail sales rose 3.2 percent over a month earlier, beating preliminary estimates of a 2.4 percent increase and compared to an upwardly revised 2.0 percent fall in December. Sales were up in 9 of the 11 subsectors, with main upward pressure from motor vehicles and parts dealers (5.3 percent) amid a rebound in sales at new car dealers. Significant contributions also came from higher sales at food and beverage stores (2.2 percent); general merchandise stores (2.9 percent); and at health and personal care shops (0.8 percent). In major Canadian provinces, gains were led by British Columbia (4.0 percent), followed by Quebec (3.9 percent), and Ontario at last (3.1 percent).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The euro weakened to $1.10, from a two-week high of $1.114 hit on Thursday but remained above a 2-year low of $1.08 reached earlier in the month as traders digested the recent Fed move while progress in talks between Russia and Ukraine stalled. The US central bank started its rate hiking cycle in March with a 0.25 bps hike and is set to increase borrowing costs six more times this year. Last week, the ECB said it may end asset purchases in Q3 as surging inflation more than offset concerns about Russia's shock invasion of Ukraine. The bloc’s inflation is already running at record highs and is now likely to be more persistent on the back of higher commodity prices and a tight labor market. Meanwhile, Russia may have averted default as coupon payments on its sovereign bonds due this week were reportedly received. For the week, the single currency is up more than 1%, the most since the first week of February. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago soybeans futures rose again to above $16.5 per bushel, bouncing off from a two-week low and approaching their highest level since September 2012 amid ongoing supply disruptions from the Black Sea region and the world's top exporter Argentina. Argentina announced that it would immediately halt export registrations of soybean oil, soy meal, and other related products, arguing the government wants to raise tariffs to 33% from the current 31%. The move pauses sales and exports of the 2021/22 crop, which could tighten the oilseed supplies already squeezed by drought. The soybean market has been rallying on the back of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is a major global supplier of corn and sunflower oil, and disruption to production due to the current conflict with Russia puts additional pressure on other grains and vegetable oils. </td>

Silicon Valley recruiters point to frustration among candidates, who may have been granted options near an all-time high and are deeply underwater after the sell-off. All four companies have share prices that are more than 46% off their peaks.                                                                                                     , "Seeing their earnings shrink on a daily basis is distracting," said Will Hunsinger, a former start-up founder and CEO of executive search firm Riviera Partners. "There's a lot of pressure for these companies to take action — either repricing options to reflect market conditions, or coming up with supplemental cash compensation for folks — especially when you have companies performing well but volatility and the uncertainty in the markets is depressing the stock price.", It's common for tech employees to forego a higher base salary for a bigger slice of company shares. For decades, the move has allowed for a substantial payday in a successful public offering or acquisition. For start-ups, it can be a less expensive way in the near-term to attract employees.                                                                                                                                                                                       , But that trade-off doesn't work if share prices drop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , High-growth tech names have been crushed by the threat of higher interest rates and the Federal Reserve's policy pivot. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has seen taken the brunt of it and dropped into correction territory, down more than 10% from its record high in November.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "So much capital was flowing into venture and the public markets, the valuations were astronomical," Stanford GSB professor Robert Siegel said. "Gravity always comes back, and capital is now looking for more conservative places to go."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Fintech companies were some of the biggest winners during the pandemic, and are now seeing the deepest pain as investors pivot to safe haven trades. ARK Invest's Fintech Innovation ETF is down more than 31%, while Affirm has lost more than 63% of its value since January and 79% since its peak in November.                                                                                                                                                                        , Robinhood shares are down roughly 70% over the past six months and are off 84% from the all-time high in its debut week in August. The brokerage start-up offered to issue employees new stock in December, at roughly $19 per share. The stock was trading near $13 as of Thursday. Robinhood declined to comment on its moves.                                                                                                                                                          , Roku, down 47% this year and 75% since its peak in July, gave employees a new restricted stock-unit grant and pay cash raises of up to 40%, according to data compiled by Blind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Snap and Chewy, down 27% and 28% respectively this year, are both offering one-time restricted stock unit grants. Uber, which is down more than 21% this year and 46% from its peak last February, has matched older employees' compensation to match the offer for new hires.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Amazon is trying something different for employees. The tech giant announced its first stock split since the dot-com boom last week, giving investors 20 shares for each share they currently own. The latest change to its compensation is targeted at Amazon employees to offer "more flexibility in how they manage their equity in Amazon and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company," a spokesperson said.                                 , The boom in tech valuations has been just as prolific in private markets. Tech start-ups raised a record $621 billion in venture capital funding last year, double from a year earlier, according to CB Insights. The cool-down in publicly traded tech names is likely to knock down valuations of private start-ups, although it may take longer.                                                                                                                                       , "Late-stage unicorns are going to get hit it just hasn't materialized yet on paper," said Jason Stomel, CEO of talent agency Cadre.

Piper said it will be more difficult for Wingstop to keep a premium valuation during a restaurant industry expansion cycle as higher expenses hit earnings.                  , Rent The Runway (RENT) – The fashion rental company's stock rallied 4.2% in premarket action after Jefferies began coverage with a "buy" rating. The firm said Rent The Runway's extensive offerings and high barrier to entry are among the factors that will drive top-line growth of as much as 50%.                                  , SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) – The solar equipment and software producer's 2 million shares offering was priced at $295 per share, compared with Thursday's close of $314.60.

A phone call between US President Biden and China President Xi Jinping today to discuss the war will also be in the spotlight. On the corporate front, shares of Eni, Iveco Group, Unicredit and Telecom Italia were among the worst performers. </td>

USDA’s weekly export sales data showed that cotton shipments reached 96% of the USDA’s marketing year estimates to 371,400 bales, which is also 5% more than that of the previous week and 34% higher from the prior 4-week average. At the same time, concerns grew over the drought conditions in West Texas on the back of lower than normal precipitation forecasts for the area. Also, USDA in its March 10th report estimated 2021/22 global cotton consumption to be 111,000 bales higher compared to last month’s projections while it sees world ending stocks 1.7 million bales lower due to smaller global production, particularly from India. </td>

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point for the first time since 2018 and lowered its growth forecasts in the face of war and inflation. Still, concerns persist about the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine on global growth despite China's promise to roll out more economic stimulus. Locally, President Ramaphosa said that South Africa risks being rocked by strong economic headwinds in the coming months as the “conflict between Russia and Ukraine” impacts the global economy. The country's outlook is also growing cloudier due to domestic structural issues, in particular recurrent load shedding, corruption and lack of progress in economic reforms. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> St. Louis Fed's Bullard says the central bank should raise rates above 3% this year </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Friday he thinks the central bank should raise interest rates the equivalent of 12 times this year to convince the public it is serious about fighting inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                     , As the lone dissenter at this week's Federal Reserve meeting, Bullard said in a statement that he would like to see the central bank's benchmark interest rate boosted above 3% from the near-0% level where it had stood.                                                                                                                                                                       , "This would quickly adjust the policy rate to a more appropriate level for the current circumstances," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Following its two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday said it would raise overnight rates for banks by 0.25 percentage point, historically the typical increment with which the FOMC moves. Accompanying economic projections indicated a path this year that would see the equivalent of seven rate hikes, or 1.75 percentage points.                                   , The move was the first time the Fed has raised the rate since December 2018 and came in response to a stunning increase in inflation that has seen prices rise at their fastest pace in 40 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                , Bullard was the only FOMC member to vote against the move, stating he would have preferred a rate hike of 0.5 percentage point, or 50 basis points. He added the Fed also should have started the process of reducing the nearly $9 trillion in bond holdings it has accumulated over the past 14 years.                                                                                         , In his statement Friday, Bullard said inflation is hurting people the Fed is trying to help the most, namely those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "The burden of excessive inflation is particularly heavy for people with modest incomes and wealth and for those with limited ability to adjust to a rising cost of living," he said. "The combination of strong real economic performance and unexpectedly high inflation means that the Committee's policy rate is currently far too low to prudently manage the U.S. macroeconomic situation.", Fed officials overall were divided on how to proceed with rates this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Ten members penciled in a fed funds rate of 1.75%-2% by year's end, but eight said it should be higher. The highest "dot" on the committee's dot plot, presumably Bullard's, indicated a range of 3%-3.25%.                                                                                                                                                                                      , He pointed out that the Fed has moved that aggressively before, in 1994-95 to combat a revving economy and a gradual rise in inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "The results were excellent," Bullard said. "The Committee achieved 2% inflation on average and the U.S. economy boomed during the second half of the 1990s. I think the Committee should try to achieve a similar outcome in the current environment."                                                                                                                                          , On the issue of the Fed's balance sheet, Bullard did not provide details of what he thinks the central bank should do, saying only that "a plan" at this week's meeting would have been appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                             , The post-meeting statement indicated that the committee "expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting." Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said afterward that the process could begin as soon as May.                                                                                                        , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Corn Bounces Back on Renewed Supply Worries </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Corn futures traded close to $7.5 per barrel, rising from its 10-month low of $ 7.3 touched on March 16th amid expectations of lower supplies from Russia and Ukraine, the two major corn exporters. Little progress was made in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, even after the fourth round of negotiations, raising renewed fears of further supply disruptions from the Black Sea region. Since the time Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukraine suspended commercial shipping at its ports while Russia paused grain trade following West’s trade sanctions on Moscow. At the same time, the USDA sees 2021/22 global corn ending stocks at 302.2 million, down 0.9 million from last month’s projections as production increases  in India partially offset the declines in Argentina and South Africa. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A state representative threatened to introduce legislation that would bar local governments from doing business with companies that had such policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Follow our latest coverage of business, markets and economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , By Coral Murphy Marcos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A Texas legislator warned Citigroup on Friday that he would introduce a bill to prevent the bank from underwriting municipal bonds in the state unless it rescinded its policy covering travel expenses for employees who go outside their state to seek an abortion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , State Representative Briscoe Cain, a Republican from the Houston area, wrote on Facebook and Twitter that the bill would bar local governments from doing business with any company “that pays abortion-related expenses of its employees or that provides abortion coverage as an employee benefit.” He said he had sent a cease-and-desist letter to Citigroup’s chief executive, Jane Fraser, calling the policy a “misuse of shareholder money.”                                                                                   , Citigroup stated in a filing on Tuesday that it would provide travel benefits to employees seeking abortions outside their state, “in response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states.” Last year, Texas enacted a law that bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. The law took effect in September.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Citigroup has 8,500 employees in Texas. Other companies, including Salesforce and Uber, have also announced policies in opposition to the abortion law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mr. Cain also vowed to propose legislation that, if passed, would authorize district attorneys from anywhere in the state to prosecute a company that violated the abortion law if the local district attorney did not take action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Representatives of Citigroup could not be reached for comment Friday night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , By Daisuke Wakabayashi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A former employee at Google sued the company on Friday, claiming it systematically discriminated against Black workers by placing them in lower-level jobs, underpaying them and denying them opportunities to advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose, seeks class-action status. The plaintiff is April Curley, who worked at Google from 2014 until she was dismissed in 2020. While there, Ms. Curley helped bring in Black employees to the company by designing programs to recruit from historically Black colleges and universities.                                                                                                                                                    , “Google is engaged in a nationwide pattern or practice of intentional race discrimination and retaliation and maintains employment policies and practices that have a disparate impact against Black employees throughout the United States,” the complaint said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A Google spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The lawsuit echoes many of the complaints that Black employees have expressed over the years about working at Google. Even as it has grown to become one of the largest private employers in the United States, the company has struggled to increase racial and gender diversity among its work force — especially among its high-paid engineering staff.                                                                                                                                                                             , According to its 2021 diversity report, 4.4 percent of Google’s U.S. employees were “Black+,” which includes workers who identify as more than one race, one of which is Black. That is far below the national average of 9.1 percent for digital publishing and search companies, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The lawsuit said Google systematically hired Black employees at a lower job status than was appropriate for their experience. Since pay is tied to job levels, this allowed the company to underpay Black employees relative to their peers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Qualified Black candidates were often deemed not “Googly” enough — an arbitrary designation that was a “dog whistle” for racial discrimination, the complaint said. It also said the company often “hazed” Black job candidates with intentionally difficult questions so they would do poorly in interviews, and it accused Google of hiring Black workers into lower-paying and lower-level jobs with less advancement potential.                                                                                                    , Ms. Curley also said she was subject to a hostile work environment. During her six years at the company, she said, managers often mistook her for two other Black female colleagues. She said that she and those colleagues had not been permitted to speak or present during important meetings and that she had felt demeaned and sexualized when a manager asked which colleagues she wanted to sleep with.                                                                                                                         , The lawsuit said that Ms. Curley’s pay had been reduced and that she was reprimanded for speaking up in team meetings and challenging internal practices in 2019. A year later, the company put Ms. Curley on a performance improvement plan, and it terminated her employment in September 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , By David McCabe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A court on Friday threw out what was thought to have been the first government lawsuit in the United States arguing that Amazon had broken antitrust laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Judge Hiram E. Puig-Lugo of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted Amazon’s motion to dismiss the complaint, which was filed last year by Karl Racine, the district’s attorney general, according to court records. The records did not state the reason for the dismissal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The lawsuit focused on how Amazon treats merchants that use its website to sell products. According to the lawsuit, Amazon made them sell their wares on its site at the lowest price they charged elsewhere on the web or at a lower price entirely. That caused merchants to raise prices across the board, the suit argued.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , A spokeswoman for Mr. Racine’s office said that “the Superior Court got this wrong” and that the office was “considering our legal options.” Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Regulators, lawmakers and law enforcement agencies have been trying to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. The federal government has sued Google over its power in the search industry and has sued Facebook over allegations it stamped out competition by buying start-ups that could have challenged its dominance.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But the tech giants have continued to grow. Microsoft said in January that it would buy the video game studio Activision Blizzard for almost $70 billion. And Amazon said on Thursday that it had completed its purchase of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio — which owns part of the James Bond franchise — after European regulators approved the deal.                                                                                                                                                                          , By Tara Siegel Bernard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — the giant credit-reporting companies that each keep files on roughly 200 million Americans — said on Friday that they will soon wipe away credit stains created by certain medical debts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The changes — including removing black marks for people who settled a debt after it went to collections — were cheered by consumer advocates and reflected a growing acceptance that such debts aren’t the best predictor of a consumer’s financial behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The companies said the changes would eliminate up to 70 percent of the medical debt accounts on consumers’ credit reports, which contain reams of data used to calculate the all-important three-digit credit score that is the key to mortgages, car loans, rental agreements and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Starting on July 1, medical debts that were paid after they went to collections will no longer appear on consumers’ credit reports, where they can currently linger for up to seven years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , New unpaid medical debts will now only appear after a full year of being sent to collections — instead of the current six months. That will give people more time to address the debt with their insurance companies and health care providers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , And beginning in the first half of 2023, the credit-reporting companies said, they will exclude unpaid medical collection debts under $500.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “As an industry we remain committed to helping drive fair and affordable access to credit for all consumers,” the companies’ chief executives said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The changes mirror some already in action elsewhere: The formulas used to generate credit scores have already been updated to reduce the influence of paid medical debts. But older scoring models are still widely in circulation, so consumers haven’t necessarily reaped the benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , And the three companies’ changes do go a bit further — for example, they will expunge more unpaid medical debts — while reducing the negative information flowing into the calculations of lenders that haven’t adopted the latest formulas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “This is huge, no doubt about it,” said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, “and it helps those people who have medical debt due to things like co-pays and deductibles, which is usually under $500.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But the changes will do little to lift the scores of people with the largest unpaid debts, who are often dealing with catastrophic or costly illnesses that result in high bills even with insurance coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “It is the sickest and poorest, the most vulnerable, who are the 30 percent,” Ms. Wu added, referring to the portion of unpaid medical debt accounts that will remain on credit reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , FICO, the most widely used credit score, baked in changes to ignore paid  debts and to weigh certain unpaid medical collections less heavily starting in 2014 with its FICO 9 formula. It found that ignoring collection accounts — medical or otherwise — that had been paid would actually improve its score’s accuracy, so it eliminated them entirely.                                                                                                                                                                             , It also found that people with unpaid medical collections were less risky than those with other types of unpaid collections, so it factored in that information as well. But people with any unpaid accounts (including medical) were still riskier than those with none at all, so it did not go as far as eliminating medical debt from its algorithm altogether.                                                                                                                                                                    , VantageScore, FICO’s main competitor, made similar changes to its formula even earlier. It eliminated all paid collections, including medical debt, with a scoring model introduced in 2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Ethan Dornhelm, FICO’s vice president of scores and predictive analytics, said the company was working with the credit-reporting companies to quantify how the changes may shift scores — and how many people will be affected. He said he believed the changes would have a similar effect as when the reporting companies eliminated two other sources of negative information: tax liens and civil judgments. Those affected generally saw their scores rise by 20 points or less, he said.                                         , If a consumer had an otherwise spotless credit report and eliminated a medical bill — paid or unpaid — it could boost a score by more than 25 points, he added. (FICO scores range from 300 to 850, the higher the better.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “The more pristine the file looks after you take away that negative information, the more that score can increase,” Mr. Dornhelm said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The bureaus’ announcements came just weeks after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it would be scrutinize the credit companies’ treatment of medical debt and would consider an outright ban on including medical debt in credit reports. The agency said its research suggested that roughly 43 million people had medical bills on their credit report as of June, totaling around $88 billion. Fifty-eight percent of collections debt appearing on credit reports was tied to medical bills, the bureau estimated.     , Medical debts are often difficult to resolve given the nation’s byzantine insurance system and confounding billing practices. Sometimes consumers aren’t even aware unpaid bills are lurking on their credit reports until they apply for a loan and their score is lower than expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Regulators have targeted medical debts on credit reports before. Seven years ago, the credit bureaus reached a settlement with the New York State attorney general (and later with attorneys general of dozens of others) to overhaul their approach to fixing errors and their treatment of medical debt. Under that agreement, the companies established the six-month waiting period before reporting delinquent medical debt on consumers’ files; it also removed medical debts from reports after they had been paid by insurance., By Cecilia Kang                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A judge on Tuesday threw out motions by the attorney general of the District of Columbia to name Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, as a defendant in a privacy lawsuit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Judge Maurice A. Ross of Superior Court of the District of Columbia said in a hearing that Washington’s attorney general, Karl Racine, had waited too long to try to amend the lawsuit to name Mr. Zuckerberg as a defendant, a move that sought to hold him personally accountable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “The problem I have with this is you wait three years,” Judge Ross said, referring to the addition of Mr. Zuckerberg to the case, which was filed in the court in December 2018. “What value does it add to name him? There’s no more relief for the consumers of the district.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Judge Ross also opposed a demand by Mr. Racine to depose Mr. Zuckerberg for the lawsuit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr. Racine’s lawsuit accused Facebook, which renamed itself Meta last year, of misleading consumers about privacy on the platform by allowing Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, to obtain sensitive data from more than 87 million users, including more than half the district’s residents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Mr. Racine tried to add Mr. Zuckerberg as a defendant in October, saying he wanted to send a message to all corporate chief executives that they could be responsible for harming consumers. Mr. Zuckerberg, by being named in the lawsuit, could have been exposed to financial and other penalties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “Our lawsuit is moving forward against Facebook,” a spokeswoman for Mr. Racine’s office said Friday. “The company failed to protect the data of its users — tens of millions of users nationally and nearly half of all District residents — when Cambridge Analytica acquired and used that data to manipulate the 2016 election.

Most of the planes were made by Boeing.                                                                                                                     , On Feb. 24, the department imposed broad restrictions on technology that could be exported to Russia, part of an effort to cripple the country’s military and strategic industries. In addition to semiconductors, telecommunications equipment and sensors, the restrictions bar aircraft and some aircraft parts that are made in the United States from being sent to Russia.                                                                                                                                                       , As a result of the rules, any aircraft manufactured in the United States, or manufactured in a foreign country that used certain American parts or technology, must receive a license to travel to Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , And any entity providing services to those aircraft, including maintenance, repair and refueling, would also be in violation of the rules, the Commerce Department said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Because the aircraft are prevented from receiving any service, flights to and from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded, the department said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “We will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws,” Commerce Secretary Gina M.

Earlier, the bank’s board of directors held interest rates at 20 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The bank said the doubling in interest rates on Feb. 28, from 9.5 percent, and capital controls curbing the movement of money had helped sustain financial stability in Russia and stop uncontrolled price increases. But the latest inflation data shows that, as of March 11, prices in Russia had risen 12.5 percent from a year earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to strict economic sanctions by the United States and Europe, encouraged a large number of Western companies and banks to retreat from the country, and isolated Russia from much of the global financial system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “The Russian economy is entering the phase of a large-scale structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation,” the Russian central bank said in a statement Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Gross domestic product “will decline in the next quarters,” Ms. Nabiullina said later. Two consecutive quarters of economic decline are generally considered to be a recession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The effects of the sanctions are being keenly felt in Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “Today, almost all companies are experiencing disruptions in production and logistical chains and in their settlements with foreign counterparties,” Ms. Nabiullina said. Inflation was driven higher, she said, by a rise in demand for cars, household appliances, electronic devices and other goods as people rushed to buy because they feared prices would rise higher and supplies would run out.                                                                                                                               , The ruble has lost about 30 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , President Vladimir V.

It was the index’s biggest one-week gain since November 2020, and followed months of volatility that had pulled major indexes sharply lower for the year as investors reacted to one bad economic turn after another. This week’s gains mean the S&amp;P 500 has cut its losses for the year in half, to about 6.4 percent.                                                                                   , Tech stocks, which have been hit particularly hard by concerns about rising interest rates, which would make riskier investments less appealing, rallied. Apple, the most prominent stock in the S&amp;P 500, gained 6 percent for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which had fallen four consecutive weeks, ended the week up 8.2 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                , “Too many tech stalwart stocks were oversold, and over the short term it seems unlikely Wall Street will see a material downturn now that commodity prices are no longer skyrocketing,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA, a foreign currency exchange and brokerage firm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , That volatility is most likely far from over, analysts have warned. But some of the pressures that had combined to sour once-ebullient markets seemed to be easing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The biggest daily gain was Wednesday, after the Fed finally raised its policy interest rate a quarter of a percentage point. It was the central bank’s first decisive move to tame inflation, which has been rising at the fastest pace in 40 years. Markets had been trying to anticipate the Fed’s moves for months as policymakers tiptoed toward raising rates, with some investors and analysts fearing that the central bank could move too quickly, reversing the economy’s recovery.                                           , Policymakers projected six more similarly sized moves this year, in line with what investors had expected, and the central bank’s chair, Jerome H. Powell, reassured investors on Wednesday that the economy was strong enough to withstand higher rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Oil climbed on Friday but ended the week lower, with Brent crude around $108 a barrel. That was far below its highs from earlier this month, when it approached $140 a barrel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , New lockdowns in China after a coronavirus outbreak have helped ease concerns about an energy crunch as oil from Russia, which produces about 10 percent of the world’s supply, has effectively been put on a no-buy list. It also helped that Russia and Ukraine held cease-fire talks for much of the week, even as the conflict between them intensified and Russia broadened its offensive in the country.                                                                                                                         , Coral Murphy Marcos contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , By Stanley Reed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Keeping millions of customers in Ukraine supplied with electric power amid the Russian invasion is, to say the least, challenging. Especially when the electrical grid itself becomes a target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “What we see now is that they attack transmission lines, substations, power generating stations,” said Maxim Timchenko, chief executive of DTEK, a large private Ukrainian energy company. In the early days of the war, he said, the Russian military seemed to be wary of wrecking critical civilian infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Now, he said, “they are not selective anymore.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In a video call from an undisclosed location in western Ukraine, Mr. Timchenko described how DTEK, which supplies about 20 percent of Ukraine’s electricity, and other Ukrainian utilities were scrambling to keep the lights on during the Russian onslaught.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Amid the urgency, Ukraine, which is not a member of the European Union, has also managed to achieve something in a matter of weeks that it had worked on for years: a linkup to the power grids of neighboring E.U. countries, including, according to Mr. Timchenko, Romania, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “This will help Ukraine to keep their electricity system stable, homes warm and lights on during these dark times,” said Europe’s energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, in a statement. “In this area, Ukraine is now part of Europe,” she added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In case of a major hit to its power system, Ukraine could now apply for emergency electricity supplies from the European system, Mr. Timchenko said. Ukraine also severed its electricity links to Russia and Belarus just before the invasion to establish independence from power sources in hostile countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , When its transmission lines are damaged or severed, DTEK arranges for Ukrainian soldiers to escort its emergency repair crews, dressed in flak jackets, to reach affected sites. Mr. Timchenko said six of DTEK’s roughly 60,000 employees had been killed during the war, although not while performing duties for the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Overall, Mr. Timchenko said, Ukraine’s electricity operations were “relatively stable.” Keeping things that way, though, seems tenuous. The bulk of electricity for Ukraine’s households comes from four nuclear plants, and the one at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power station, is now occupied by Russian troops after coming under attack.                                                                                                                                                                             , So far, he said, electric power consumption is down by around one-third from before the invasion on Feb. 24. That’s because of a falloff in economic activity and damage that can’t be repaired in the short term in places like Mariupol, the city on the Black Sea coast that has been under heavy Russian bombardment, and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which has also sustained major damage. Mr. Timchenko estimated that 1.3 million customers in Ukraine were, in effect, disconnected.                              , In Luhansk, one of DTEK’s eight conventional fossil fuel-burning power plants has been disconnected because of the invasion, and he is concerned about another unit that is near the Russian lines and could be cut off in the event of an advance. DTEK had also switched some generating units to natural gas when supplies of coal, which the company mines, were blocked.                                                                                                                                                          , Mr. Timchenko said only about one-third of the company’s 3.8 million customers were now paying their bills, although the banking system continues to function. He said the company — which is ultimately owned by Rinat Akhmetov, often described as Ukraine’s richest person — still had cash reserves. But he said the state-owned electricity operators badly needed an injection of international aid.                                                                                                                             , Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shaken many markets, perhaps none as severely as trading in nickel. The chaos is causing supply problems for carmakers and others that need the metal — and raising fundamental questions about how commodity markets work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The global nickel market is basically frozen, The Times’s Jack Ewing and DealBook’s Stephen Gandel report. After a surge in prices last week, trading was suspended for several days, and has struggled to function under new restrictions. On Friday, for the third time in three days, a plunge in price at the open of trading almost immediately triggered the exchange’s daily limit, below which no further trades are allowed.                                                                                                  , “The market is broken,” said Keith Wildie, the head of trading at Romco, a metals firm based in London.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Nickel users are trying to shield themselves from future shocks. Volkswagen, for example, is considering buying directly from mining companies. Nickel is a key component in batteries for electric vehicles, and volatile prices could slow the transition away from fossil fuels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Early last week, nickel’s price more than doubled in a matter of minutes, prompting the London Metal Exchange to halt trading and cancel trades made at the highest prices during the frenzy. Since then, attempts to restart trading and allow the market to settle on a price for nickel have faltered. Analysts expect nickel prices to drop, eventually, but to remain significantly higher than they were a year ago.                                                                                                             , Some hedge funds criticized the exchange’s canceling trades to help metal producers at the expense of financial traders that provide liquidity to the market. “Certainly you have to be quite hesitant about trading on an exchange that has that value system,” Jordan Brooks of the investment firm AQR told DealBook.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , For its part, the LME said that the nickel market is meant to serve end users of the metal, meaning it had to step in when prices got out of whack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , By Ephrat Livni                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Foreign crypto exchanges that do business with Russians who are under sanctions would themselves be sanctioned under a new bill sponsored by 10 Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But while punishing Russia for the invasion of Ukraine has bipartisan support, the bill does not, and senators disagree over the implications for the crypto industry.                                                                                                                                                  , Senate Republicans made their case against the bill at a committee hearing on Thursday on the use of digital assets in illicit finance. They relied on the testimony of Michael Chobanian, the founder of the crypto exchange Kuna, who has worked closely with the Ukrainian government on fund-raising for the war. He argued that restrictions on crypto could help President Vladimir V. Putin by hurting those who oppose him inside Russia.                                                                                      , Mr. Chobanian said it was “not exactly true” that Russia can use crypto to avoid all sanctions, adding that it’s “impossible” to convert large amounts of cash into crypto. And sanctions and seizures have left Russian oligarchs with crypto they can’t spend, Mr. Chobanian said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Still, Ms. Warren noted, “crypto looks like a pretty good option” for Mr. Putin and Russian oligarchs looking to skirt sanctions — as it has for others in Venezuela, Iran and North Korea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After Russia’s invasion in February, some analysts believed Russian entities could use digital currencies to bypass the control points that governments use to block deal execution, allowing Russia to blunt some of the worst effects of Western sanctions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “It would be naïve to think that they haven’t gamed out exactly this scenario,” Michael Parker, a former federal prosecutor who now heads the anti-money-laundering and sanctions practice at the Washington law firm Ferrari &amp; Associates, told The New York Times in February.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Many Russians rely on crypto for other reasons, Mr. Chobanian said Thursday. “These people are basically the opposition to the Putin regime,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , He told senators to “think of crypto as energy” that can be used for good or ill. Senator Patrick Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said that “secondary sanctions,” like those in Ms. Warren’s bill, could end up hurting more than helping, noting Mr. Chobanian’s testimony about a “correlation between those Russian people who use crypto and those who are opposed to what Putin is doing.”                                                                                                                                   , By Julie Creswell                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Koch Industries, the industrial conglomerate run by the billionaire Charles Koch, has said it will continue to operate factories in Russia as other companies pull out after Russia’s attack on Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Dave Robertson, the president and chief operating officer, said in a statement dated Wednesday that the aggression in Ukraine was an “affront to humanity,” but that Koch would not stop operating two Russian glass factories in its Guardian Industries unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Guardian’s business employs 600 people and makes up a small portion of the privately held company, which had estimated revenue of $115 billion last year. Koch Industries will “not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them,” Mr. Robertson said.                                                                                                                                                                             , In recent days, dozens of large corporations, including British American Tobacco, McDonald’s and Ikea, have said they were temporarily suspending sales, closing stores or winding down operations in Russia. Many had invested millions or billions of dollars in the country in recent decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Last week, the Russian government warned that it could nationalize the assets of Western companies that were pulling out of Russia and told its leaders to “act decisively” to preserve jobs in the country as its economy crumbled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Since the conflict started, Koch Industries has provided financial assistance to employees and their families in Ukraine and will continue to do so, Mr. Robertson said. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Indian rupee weakened towards 76.1, tracking a rally in global crude oil prices and a slightly stronger US dollar. Crude oil prices once again crossed $100 per barrel amid slim progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks even after the 4th day of negotiations, raising fears of further sanctions and prolonged disruption to Russian oil supplies.Oil prices impact India’s current account deficit and trade balance significantly as the country imports two-thirds of its oil needs. Meanwhile, India’s GDP grew at a slower 5.4% during the September-December period of 2021 while its inflation rose for the fifth consecutive month, at a higher than expected rate of 6.07% in February. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the 10-year OFZ treasury bond remained at an all-time high of 19.8% after Russia avoided default on dollar-denominated debt that could have been caused by sanctions slapped on to punish it for invading Ukraine. Russia's finance ministry said it had fully met its obligations on paying coupons on dollar-denominated Eurobonds due in 2023 and 2043. Russia was due to pay $117 million in coupon payments in what was seen as a test of its willingness and ability to repay international debt after being hit with sanctions over events in Ukraine. Russia has $38.5 billion of external borrowing outstanding and the next international bond payment falls is a $66 million coupon due on March 21, which carries a 30-day grace period. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Russian ruble stabilized near $ 104 in offshore markets Friday, not far from a psychologically critical threshold of 100 per dollar, as investors barely reacted to the Russian Central Bank decision to keep rates on hold. The Central Bank held its benchmark interest rate at 20% as expected during its March 2022 meeting, saying the 115bps hike in February helped sustain financial stability and prevented uncontrolled price rises. The ruble also showed limited reaction to indicate that Russia may have averted default on its Eurobonds. The currency has gained some ground since hitting a record low of 150 per dollar in early March on crippling Western sanctions against Moscow but remains about 30% down since the Russian attack on Ukraine started. Meanwhile, investors remained cautious as ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine appeared to have yielded no significant progress. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Malta’s annual inflation rate inched up to 4.2 percent in February of 2022, the highest since June of 2012, from 4.1 percent in the previous month. Main upward pressure came from prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages (8.4 percent vs 6.9 percent in January) largely due to higher prices of vegetables; housing &amp; utilities (5.2 percent, the same as in January); transport (3.6 percent, the same as in January); and furnishing and household maintenance (3.5 percent vs 2.9 percent). Meanwhile, inflationary pressures calmed for prices of recreation and culture (4.7 percent vs 5.5 percent); restaurants and hotels (4.4 percent vs 4.6 percent); and clothing and footwear (2.4 percent vs 3.5 percent). On a monthly basis, the CPI advanced 0.7 percent after being steady for two consecutive months. </td>

While inflation is seen approaching or exceeding the central bank’s 2% target in the coming months, the BOJ is in no mood to withdraw stimulus. This firm dovish stance contrasted sharply with other major central banks starting to tighten monetary policy.

If we reverse down to the mid 430&amp;#39;s on SPY next week, then it&amp;#39;ll be even lower by April - because next week&amp;#39;s action will confirm the rally was BS if fall right back down for that expiry. 
 
People have been loading Puts for months now, meaning absent last week&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;surprise rally&amp;quot; the market makers would have lost billions on Friday.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Of all recent corrections/crashes, this one has been my best yet, (whether it&amp;#39;s over or not). 
 
Feels good to apply learnings from 2018, 2020 to be better prepared. 
 
Not only the analysis (because charting is the easy part, no?) - but the trades... including when to do do nothing, when to scalp and when to leave swings. How to scale better and the importance of time - eg letting candles close out to see clarity through noisy price action. 
 
Starting point though is always remembering the world won&amp;#39;t end, that we&amp;#39;ve evolved to overcome obstacles, no matter how desperate they look. 
 
If you don&amp;#39;t have that foundation (and may don&amp;#39;t), no analysis is gonna save your ass. 
 
Onwards and upwards. Looking forward to a new week. Will aim to share some TA later in the day or early Monday.

“When it comes to the grinding job of capturing and holding cities, conventional military metrics suggest Russia needs a 5-to-1 advantage in urban fighting, analysts say. Meanwhile, the formula for ruling a restive territory in the face of armed opposition is 20 fighters for every 1,000 people — or 800,000 Russian troops for Ukraine’s more than 40 million people, said Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank

That’s almost as many as Russia’s entire active-duty military of 900,000, and it means controlling substantial Ukrainian territory long term could take more resources than Russia can commit, he said.

“Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war,” said Clarke.” </td>

Instead, investors should allocate to real and alternative assets including commodities, real estate, and the more active long/short stock picking strategies often employed by hedge funds. Within the equity space, value stocks should outperform growth stocks, while international stocks are likely to outperform US stocks, according to Bannister. 
 
In the short-term, Bannister admits there is room for upside in the S&amp;amp;P 500, with a potential relief rally to as high as 4,600. But those rallies should be sold rather than bought, because like in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, a 20% counter-trend rally in the market is possible amid a broader down-trend. </td>

Shame this weekend was light on fud n shitposts tho.

Following last week&amp;#39;s trading frenzy, guessing most are squeezing in a few more uber hours to pay for nest week&amp;#39;s slaughter.

And remember, it&amp;#39;s not about price pulling back, it&amp;#39;s about whether any trend holds. Most struggle with trends though. Which is good for Uber. </td>

Amid the economic shock brought by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, petrol prices have hit another record. The Foreign Ministry has said preliminary data shows about 30% of the economy is now &amp;quot;either not working or temporarily not working.&amp;quot; 
 
Nearly one-third of Ukraine’s economy has been shut down as a result of the Russian invasion, said Ukraine’s Finance Ministry, according to NBC News. 
 
Preliminary calculations show that “about 30% of the economy is now either not working or temporarily not working,” said the head of the finance ministry, Serhiy Marchenko. 
 
He said Ukraine will now have to borrow to meet its financial needs. 
 
“Now the situation is such that our tax revenues do not cover our needs, the main channel is borrowing, internal and external,” he said “We finance the needs for the army and other important thing from the budget.” </td>

I&amp;#39;m interested to hear the bull thesis on where the indices head from here, if you really don&amp;#39;t think this was a head fake, major options expiry fueled rally.  If we reverse down to the mid 430&amp;#39;s on SPY next week, then it&amp;#39;ll be even lower by April - because next week&amp;#39;s action will confirm the rally was BS if fall right back down for that expiry. 
 
People have been loading Puts for months now, meaning absent last week&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;surprise rally&amp;quot; the market makers would have lost billions on Friday. 
 
Fed tightening is usually associated with a small pop histocally, however tin one week we surpassed the gain that rally usually brings over the first couple months.  Do the math. </td>

Likely will further extend rally to double top out at $447 and $357. Why won&amp;#39;t there be selling on Monday after 4 day rise?? Likely because shorts that cashed out are wanting to wait for a final bull trap and while other shorts (myself included) were left holding heavy bags. After all, all Power has to do is say &amp;quot;economy is strong 5x&amp;quot; for bulls to start fomo buying. The good news is, puts are the cheapest they&amp;#39;ve ever been for $410 and $318 and next week PCE report comes out with Mar inflation numbers. Hold strong and have a great weekend - don&amp;#39;t get discouraged by all the fake hopium, we know the truth. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ I&amp;#39;m thinking we are gonna batman it - SPY will reach $447 on Monday and $QQQ $357 roughly +0.7% and +1.6%. This will push it the resistance of Feb 16 after FOMC minute pump. Powell pump at noon on Monday. This would reach the highest daily RSI since Jan 3 but at a much lower price and trigger bearish divergence oversold for 4hr and below. From there, I believe the indices will repeat Feb 17 - Feb 24 to finish the Batman at $410 and $318 respectively near Mon Mar 28 - Tue Mar 29. Covering will likely occur again pushing back up to PCE report by Mar 31 but to an even lower high, $440 for SPY not breaching Mar 3 and $348 for the Q&amp;#39;s and then bounce down once more falling through completely by middle of April before CPI report comes out Apr 8 and then covering before CPI but again lower, and selling once more down to $400 and $305 by end of Apr. </td>

I warned BA.2 would be the next (and likely worst) variant from following its spread in South Korea, before it started blowing up in EU or started in the US, 16 days ago.

While everyone is focused on Germany and other EU countries, South Korea still hasn&amp;#39;t peaked. They&amp;#39;ve been one of a handful of countries who had handled the pandemic phenomenally well.

Aug. 1st, 2021 (Before Delta)
Cases: 201k
Deaths: 2.1k

Oct. 5th, 2021 (Before Omicron)
Cases: 315k
Deaths: 2.5k

Jan. 1st (Omicron Surge)
Cases: 635k
Deaths: 5.5k

Feb. 1st (Before BA.2)
Cases: 864k
Deaths: 6.5k

Mar. 19 (Today)
Cases: 9.04 Million
Deaths: 12.1k

Transmission has a scientific consensus at about 2x that of Omicron.

Health risks haven&amp;#39;t reached a consensus, and deaths are a lagging indicator.

It&amp;#39;s undoubtedly twice as infectious, at least as dangerous as Omicron but may be greater than Delta, evades prior vaccination, and unique enough that it shouldn&amp;#39;t be classified as Omicron.

If VIX declines, systematic strats increase their risk exposure (risk-on, aka buy)

If VIX increases, they do the opposite. 

Trillions of dollars are coded to sell into selling and buy into buying. It’s all VaR (Value at Risk) ratio hedging dynamics. 

The coding couldn’t care less about charts or valuations. VIX is super-sensitive to headline risk. 

~75% of all trading is like this. Humans matter to headline risk and the remaining 25%.

How can you know if it&amp;#39;s a bear market? It&amp;#39;s tough. Professionals are terrible forecasting a bear market. The media worse!  If folks are predicting a bear market, know you should own stocks. Corrections are different.. stocks drop suddenly and fast and are designed to scare the pants off you. Corrections happen during a year. Don&amp;#39;t be fooled. Real bear markets start slow and calm. Stocks drop a little month-to-month but nothing dramatic. Don&amp;#39;t get suckered into unloading your positions because of a small quick correction.

And up until now he&amp;#39;s kept his word.  As the indices tumbled this year I had to ask myself what part of his voter base is he trying to appeal to?  The middle class have enough financial sense to have some type of retirement plan.  He is basically pandering to the absolute gutter-trash of the country;  people who live for Saturday night and can&amp;#39;t see past the next joint and tattoo.  Not to mention the urban gorillas who have a free pass on crime and the transsexual dog-fuckers like the one he just gave an appointment to. 
 
Maybe he - or more likely someone in his cabinet, who is actually capable of non-senility and cerebral activity - said &amp;quot;hey, maybe pointing at the smoking ashes of Wall Street and saying &amp;#39;I did that!&amp;#39; isn&amp;#39;t going to win anyone over... </td>

Don&amp;#39;t follow those who charge because their agenda is to make money off of you first and foremost.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ First $SPX is king; if it goes down everything else follows and it is &amp;quot;most compliant&amp;quot; index to TA IMO.  
I don&amp;#39;t think the bottom is in yet, but it should be around the recent low. Here are the possible scenarios with high chances of happening IMO.  
1- We pullback to 4300 in SPX and resume the uptrend slowly to reach 4700 by mid to end of April; then go down lower to 3800-4000 area (similar to 2015-2016, See pic), then a monster rally around June that will end in a secular bear market around March 2023. $SPX 5300-5600, NDX 19000-20000.   
2- Go down from here (or gap up a little bit and go down) to around 4000 and reverse (similar to 2010), followed by a 45% up rally ending in a secular bear market.  
3- Pullback a little go up near 4590 and go down hard 15-20%, similar to February 2001; we are already in a secular bear market.   
 
The daily reversal and weekly monster engulfing in the Nasdaq make me believe that the first secnario is in play. GL.

The S&amp;amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 both had their best week since November 2020 🚀 
 
As expected, the FED raised rates for the first time since 2018. The market took it well and rallied. Doesn’t change the fact that we have record inflation and huge price increases in commodities. Not to speak of the stupid war by the Russians.  
 
China stocks had a wild week. Tanked on Monday, only to be saved by the Chinese State Council who pledges support for the economy and capital markets. Huge rally followed, this might be the bottom for China stocks.   
 
My portfolio did well this week and is outperforming $SPY &amp;amp; $QQQ on the year, although still in the red. Holding 20% in cash bc I couldn&amp;#39;t get all the prices I wanted. Might drag down performance if the market goes up, but I prefer to buy when stocks are undervalued, so it’s fine. </td>

My thoughts on the week ahead ....

Bear mkt rallies can be vicious. But was that all that was, a bear mkt rally? Or has the mkt put in a bottom? One thing that is undeniable, the downtrend has been broken and the SPY has regained both the 50 and 200 day EMAs. For me, that is an important technical development. So back to new highs? 

No. The top was already put in first week in January.

My new Game Plan goes out tomorrow. It will focus on &amp;quot;Illusion vs Reality&amp;quot;  For those interested,  email me at

 jessielivermore1929@gmail.com 

We have a new trading range, and this new range is going to offer opportunities to lighten up on stocks that are being lifted with all the momentum and will continue to underperform. 

The risks to the mkt remain. However, there are still many stocks that will weather the turbulence. I will discuss these as well as the ones I feel are set up as great short opportunities. 

Enjoy the weekend! </td>

I&amp;#39;ve been trading full-time for a year and a half now, and if I have learned a single thing, it&amp;#39;s that the market is all fuckery controlled and manipulated by the 1% monopoly.   All it takes is basic deductive reasoning to recognizing that of course the market is all fuckery.   This is because it it wasn&amp;#39;t, it would be way to easy for any rational minded retail trader to be highly profitable and that would be completely unacceptable.  Please read that last sentence one more time.  It&amp;#39;s not complicated.   Rule 1:  Retail investors shall never have any long-term chance whatsoever against the billionaires, period.

12 noon

Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks at NABE conference

What’s NABE?

Since 1975, the National Association for Bilingual Education (NABE) has been a non-profit membership organization that works to advocate for educational equity and excellence for bilingual/multilingual students in a global society.

Proceed swings with caution , yes major levels broke, However our price targets hit very early….

Take profits - Overbought signal from 15 min chart - 2 hour is  solid indication Joe Monday &amp;amp; or Tuesday can pull back to some strong consolidation levels… 

Whenever the hour hits 70+ &amp;gt; consolidates back down to 50 minimum… 

Calls are risky imo - puts are risky as well but look more promising … </td>

Tesla is a laser focus on efficient factories and optimized production of a intentionally small  handful of products.   Namely 4 - S3XY ... and three additional products (Semi and Roadster and Cybertruck) are seriously considered optional as far as they are concerned.  What isn&amp;#39;t optional is creating another production hell.  Hence the focus on efficient assembly.  Meanwhile the public can&amp;#39;t seem to get enough of it and they are trying to raise prices enough to slow down the order backlog ... but that is getting ridiculous ... no matter the price; the orderbook get&amp;#39;s filled. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $MULN - AMC was $1.98 a share in January 2021- a $1b valuation. It’s $16 now ($8b valuation), and got as high as $70. 

$MULN could very well take the same stock price path as AMC to $70. But unlike AMC, it has catalysts and a future. This could be big. At $70 a share, that’s around a $7 billion dollar valuation. Beyond fair. AMC TODAY is worth $8b, meaning it got up to $35b. If MULN reached AMC’s market cap when it was at $70, MULN would get to around $300 a share. Again, $70 a share = $7billion market cap… while we have $LCID at $50b $RIVN at $40b (was $100b) $TSLA $1 trillion. 

$MULN has more potential than AMC, a failing and obsolete business model with high overhead and low margins. LCID didn’t have any sales while it was worth $60b. It’s the potential. I think it should be worth more than $AMC </td>

This clown looks like reading from the same teleprompter she was reading when threatened Russia 🇷🇺 with severe consequences before the invasion with inferiority and we all know what happens next sadly ! this time about China 🇨🇳 with same threat and inferiority and  will likely we’ll watch Taiwan getting invaded !! IMO 

Failure after failure using same failed diplomacy zero intelligent thinking !

My thoughts on the week ahead ....

Bear mkt rallies can be vicious. But was that all that was, a bear mkt rally? Or has the mkt put in a bottom? One thing that is undeniable, the downtrend has been broken and the SPY has regained both the 50 and 200 day EMAs. For me, that is an important technical development. So back to new highs? 

No. The top was already put in first week in January.

My new Game Plan goes out tomorrow. It will focus on &amp;quot;Illusion vs Reality&amp;quot;  For those interested,  email me at

 jessielivermore1929@gmail.com 

We have a new trading range, and this new range is going to offer opportunities to lighten up on stocks that are being lifted with all the momentum and will continue to underperform. 

The risks to the mkt remain. However, there are still many stocks that will weather the turbulence. I will discuss these as well as the ones I feel are set up as great short opportunities. 

Enjoy the weekend! </td>

Yesterday ES_F Futures filled the gap up 4460s from the week of 03/04. Now It’s at the top of 3 months char but still in the bearish sentiment. ES_F futures still have a gap down 4260s, 4130s and 4070s to be filled end of March now. Then we will see TSLA fill gap at $744.  All news from the media have been setup for the market!
