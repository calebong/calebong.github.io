He likes to joke around, but isn’t as funny as he thinks he is; he overshares and loves memes; he occasionally goes too far, and gets himself in trouble; he seems to think the platform is unfairly suppressing the views of people with whom he identifies. Thanks to the flattening effects of Twitter, the only real difference between the site’s median user and Musk is about $257 billion and 85.4 million followers. He has more followers than Narendra Modi, the prime minister of the largest democracy on Earth, and fewer than Taylor Swift. No one in the history of the modern world has ever been as wealthy as he is. He also thinks the number 420 is so funny that he seems to have determined the final value of his offer ($54.20 per share) to accommodate its inclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , It’s surprising that Musk would stake so much of his wealth on a site that so many of its users profess to hate. According to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk will personally supply as much as $21 billion in cash to close out the deal, representing about 8 percent of his net worth. If he took that money and set it on fire, he would still be the richest person on the planet. And yet, if you turned the clock back to just 2018, $21 billion would represent 100 percent of Musk’s net worth. The rapid growth of his wealth has coincided with his embrace of the platform as a chaotic communication tool, making the acquisition almost painfully recursive — his billions are tied up with his eccentric persona, and now he is using the billions to wholly own the arena that allows him to bring his unvarnished self to the masses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , It is in one sense simply another instance of a familiar story: Billionaire buys important vector for public discourse. Perhaps you’ve noticed that it’s been happening a lot lately. In 2013, Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post for the comparatively minuscule sum of $250 million. Five years later, the investment firm controlled by Patrick Soon-Shiong — like Musk, a billionaire businessman from South Africa — bought The Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune for around $500 million. All the while, Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire widow of Steve Jobs, has been making media investments of her own, most prominently The Atlantic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Whatever you make of all this, each of these publications has an editorial staff with a great degree of independence, constrained by journalistic norms created over decades — and often enforced on Twitter. Twitter, by contrast, is a site where you can log on and say more or less whatever you want, and Musk has said he would like to make it even more that way. He has stated that he disagrees with the current content-moderation policies, which has led to yet another round of the sort of mind-numbing culture-war discourse the site so effectively fosters: Will Musk allow any sort of speech — even Nazis? Why are liberals so afraid of free speech? Back and forth all day like this. But either way, the same fact delights one side and terrifies the other: One guy will get to radically reshape this platform in his own image, and he seems to be doing so mostly for fun, and possibly for profit. The conservative cartoonist Ben Garrison depicted the acquisition like this: Musk as a half-man, half-cat, breaking into Twitter’s bird cage, stroking the bird’s head menacingly and purring: “Pretty bird! I’m gonna teach you to say ‘free speech!’” This is meant to be a positive take on the story., Musk’s acquisition has been more than a little crazy-making on a platform where many users’ chief obsession is the site itself. The text box of Twitter still prompts every user with “What’s happening?” What’s happening, invariably, is that they are looking at Twitter. This simple fact accounts for perhaps 99 percent of the acrimony on there, which is rarely about events in the outside world and frequently about the content of other tweets. Just about everyone who uses Twitter feels that he is being wronged by it somehow, but he can’t stop looking. And one of the perverse facts about it is that the more power and followers one accumulates, the more one risks becoming held forth as an example of all that’s wrong in the world — none more so than the winner of the entire game of global capitalism. No wonder Musk thinks there’s still value to be unlocked: He loves the site, even though his experience with it is most likely horrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , And because Musk is the single wealthiest person on the planet, it’s easy for many to believe that the deal is not about a desire to refurbish and renew “the digital town square” but something more nefarious or stupid. Some — including the second wealthiest man on the planet, Jeff Bezos — have speculated that Tesla’s exposure to the Chinese market will in fact make it more susceptible to censorship under Musk’s ownership. Others have fretted about his now owning journalists’ D.M.s; some think that’s hilarious. There are some who fear that he’s going to bring back former President Donald Trump, another billionaire power user of the platform; plenty of others find that idea exhilarating. He’s stated a desire to rein in bot accounts, which probably seem like a bigger problem to you when you have 85.4 million followers and tweet about crypto and stock prices and the numbers 420 and 69. On Monday, people kept posting unflattering pictures of him — from his PayPal days, or standing next to Ghislaine Maxwell — joking it’ll be the last day they can get away with it.                                                                                                                       , And this is what’s so unsettling about his acquisition: the strong sense that — even at its most anodyne — it’s an act of vanity, a means of improving the personal experience of one user of the agora. And there’s something to it. Musk oozes with a desperation to be thought of as funny, an ailment no amount of money can fix and perhaps his most relatable quality. His outing on “Saturday Night Live” was borderline painful to watch, even by contemporary “S.N.L.” standards — in particular his monologue, which was full of fascinating be-nice-to-me defense mechanisms: an announcement that he was the first host with Asperger’s syndrome; an appearance by his mother, who hugged him and told him she loved him; and a declaration of his vision for the future: “I believe in a renewable-energy future; I believe that humanity must become a multiplanetary, spacefaring civilization.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , He paused after that part: “Those seem like exciting goals, don’t they? Now I think if I just posted that on Twitter, I’d be fine. But I also write things like ‘69 days after 4/20 again haha’ ” — an actual post from June 28, 2020, which was indeed 69 days after April 20 — “I don’t know, I thought it was funny. That’s why I wrote ‘haha’ at the end. Look, I know I sometimes say or post strange things, but that’s just how my brain works. To anyone I’ve offended, I just want to say: I reinvented electric cars and I’m sending people to Mars in a rocket ship. Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Never before has the Twitter-user mentality been so neatly summarized: I know you may not like my jokes, but what you have to understand is that I’m actually cool. The capital markets have rewarded Musk richly for all of that; Twitter, home of the guillotine meme, has not — or at least not uniformly. But because of the former, any frustration Musk may have with the latter can potentially reshape the closest thing we have to a digital town square. It’s not clear that there’s anything to mourn in this changing of the guard, except perhaps for the fact that it can happen at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , This is what’s so dizzying about living in a society with individuals who control so much wealth: Their whims can be made into reality with startling ease — and their whims can be shaped by the same dumb websites we all use to waste company time. It’s not as if Twitter was run like a kibbutz beforehand, but it responded to a diverse web of stakeholders: Wall Street, customers, users, the press, governments, etc. And now, one $44 billion lark later, it will respond to one man whose frankly complex relationship to the site’s services is apparent to anyone who cares to look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , If his experiences as a user should presumably shape his approach to governing the platform, his experience as the visionary behind enormous real-world projects may not prepare him for the complexities of managing something as amorphous as Twitter: a pulsating and frequently unpleasant conversation among hundreds of millions of people who have no real reason to be talking to one another; a place for screwing around that has also helped reshape several industries and institutions; a for-profit platform that makes its money selling ads, but that is mostly experienced as a way to tell jokes and share links; and above all, a service that a small but influential subset of humanity has allowed to colonize their free time and minds to a great degree over the last decade, with profound and unpredictable results. He may soon discover that Twitter is not rocket science — it’s harder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Willy Staley is a story editor for The New York Times Magazine.

Now he had a request: Would the president please honor a campaign promise and use the enclosed pen to wipe out thousands of dollars he owes in student loans?                                                                                                     , The letter-writing campaign — #PensForBiden — is the latest attempt to sway Mr. Biden on a high-stakes dilemma as the midterm elections approach and much of his domestic agenda remains stalled: What to do about the $1.6 trillion that more than 45 million people owe the government?                                                                                                                              , So far, Mr. Biden has extended the pandemic pause on student loan payments four times, most recently until Aug. 31. Payments have now been on hold for more than two years, over two presidential administrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But all that time poses problems. Many of the issues that have long bedeviled the loan system have only grown more complicated during the pause, and receiving bills again will infuriate and frustrate millions of people who feel trapped by a broken system and crushing debt.                                                                                                                                      , Now some advocates believe Mr. Biden will have little choice but to do something that has divided his advisers: Wipe out thousands of dollars in debt per borrower with the stroke of a pen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “If they want a smooth transition to repayment, I think the only way to do that is canceling debt,” said Natalia Abrams, the founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center, an activist group that supported the letter-writing campaign. “I think we’re at the point of no return on that.”                                                                                                                               , Perhaps the most concrete signal came this week: Representatives Tony Cárdenas and Nanette Diaz Barragán, two California Democrats, said Mr. Biden had discussed loan relief during a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                        , The lawmakers said Mr. Biden had indicated that he was looking to provide some form of debt relief and was exploring his legal options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “He’s serious about it, and he’s looking to do something,” Mr. Cárdenas said. “He’s looking to do something that we would very much like, and he’s hoping to do it soon.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Calls to cancel student debt have hung over Mr. Biden since before his presidency began, driven by borrowers and the progressive wing of his Democratic Party. He backed the idea on the campaign trail in 2020. “I’m going to make sure that everybody in this generation gets $10,000 knocked off of their student debt as we try to get out of this God-awful pandemic,” he told an audience in Miami.              , Senate Democrats lack the votes to help make good on that promise, leaving executive action as the only possible pathway. But close allies say some influential members of Mr. Biden’s team have been reluctant for him to do it — some because they disagree with the idea of forgiveness and some because they don’t believe he has the authority.                                                                   , “He’s got lawyers telling him he shouldn’t,” said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat and a key supporter of Mr. Biden. But Mr. Clyburn, the most senior Black lawmaker in Congress, said presidential actions had brought sweeping changes before, including Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation and Harry Truman’s order banning segregation in the military., “If executive orders can free slaves and integrate the armed services, it can eliminate debt,” Mr. Clyburn said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Forgiving $10,000 per borrower would require the government to write off $321 billion in loans, according to an analysis released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last week. A separate study by the bank found that surveyed borrowers reported a 16 percent chance of quickly missing a payment if the moratorium ended.                                                                                     , Mr. Nelson, a 32-year-old bank operations associate in Minneapolis, said the pause had freed up $120 a month for home repairs and other expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “It’s been a big change, and a relief,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , A recent Morning Consult poll found that more than 60 percent of registered voters were in favor of some level of student debt cancellation. But despite Mr. Biden’s campaign promise, his advisers have been divided, three people with knowledge of the discussions said.                                                                                                                                            , Some view debt cancellation as relief for critical constituencies, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Others oppose it as bad policy or because they fear the economic effects of putting more money in consumers’ pockets when inflation is soaring.                                                                                        , But the pressure on Mr. Biden to act has only grown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whose pledge to cancel up to $50,000 per borrower was a centerpiece of her 2020 presidential primary bid, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, led more than 90 congressional Democrats in sending Mr. Biden a letter last month asking him to “provide meaningful student debt cancellation.”                                                       , Outside groups have seized on Congress’s inability to enact other administration priorities, like voting rights protections and Mr. Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, as reason for the president to take matters into his own hands.                                                                                                                                                                                  , The New Georgia Project, a group focusing on voter registration founded by the gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, has cast debt relief as an action that would serve Mr. Biden’s pledge to put racial equity at the forefront of his presidency.                                                                                                                                                                   , “Much of your administration’s legislative priorities have been stymied by obstructionist legislators,” the group wrote in a joint letter with the advocacy group the Debt Collective that was reviewed by The New York Times. “Student debt cancellation is a popular campaign promise that you, President Biden, have the executive power to deliver on your own.”                                                   , Astra Taylor, a founder of the Debt Collective, said she believed resistance inside the administration was wearing down as advocates have pushed back against the belief that forgiveness would be a giveaway to well-off college graduates — a rationale that Mr. Biden cited last year as a reason for not backing a $50,000 cancellation.                                                                           , Such considerations are still on Mr. Biden’s mind. He brought up a similar question on Tuesday, asking members of the Hispanic Caucus whether debt relief should be applied to borrowers of both public and private institutions, according to Mr. Cárdenas. Mr. Cárdenas replied that relief should be granted regardless of the university attended.                                                                 , Top White House officials keep dangling the possibility of debt forgiveness. In announcing the latest pause extension last month, Mr. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said he “hasn’t ruled out” the idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But Mr. Biden’s power to act unilaterally remains an open legal question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Last April, at Mr. Biden’s request, the Education Department’s acting general counsel wrote an analysis of the legality of canceling debt via executive action. The analysis has not been released; a version provided in response to public records requests was fully redacted.                                                                                                                                      , Proponents of forgiveness say the education secretary has broad powers to modify or cancel debt, which both the Trump and Biden administrations have leaned on to carry out the payment freeze that started in March 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Legal challenges would be likely, although who would have standing is unclear. A Virginia Law Review article this month argued that the answer might be no one: States, for example, have little say in the operation of a federal loan system.                                                                                                                                                                        , Leading Republicans remain strongly opposed. Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top Republican on the Education and Labor Committee, called the latest extension a taxpayer-funded giveaway to “graduate students and Ivy League lawyers” and said she feared it was “setting the stage for blanket loan forgiveness.”                                                                                , The timing of the latest extension — ending two months before the midterms — makes some advocates think so, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “You wouldn’t do this if you’re going to kick your base in the teeth eight weeks before they go to the polls,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. “You do this if you want the world to watch you deliver for the people who put you in the White House.”                                                                                                                 , New sources of aid. The Education Department will use one-time waivers and adjustments to retroactively credit millions of borrowers with additional payments toward loan forgiveness. The move will help people seeking to have their loans eliminated under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and through the use of income-driven repayment plans.                                                        , Payments delayed again. President Biden pushed the restart date for federal student loan payments to Sept. 1, extending a pause put in place at the start of the pandemic. Millions of borrowers who have defaulted on their federal student loans will also get a fresh start and have their loans restored to good standing.                                                                                         , The cost of private loans. As the Fed changes its benchmark rate, private student loan borrowers should expect to pay more, as both fixed and variable rate loans are linked to benchmarks that track the federal funds rate.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Companies step in. As employers seek to hire and keep workers in a challenging job market, more are  treating student debt repayments as a job benefit: A recent study found that about 17 percent of large employers offered some form of student debt assistance.                                                                                                                                                    , Politics aren’t the only reason to forgive debt, borrower advocates believe. It would also be a chance to fix longstanding problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The Education Department is functionally the country’s largest consumer bank, holding more in loans than Americans owe on any consumer debt other than mortgages. But its outside loan servicers have for years drawn scathing criticism from government auditors and watchdogs, with even basic functions sometimes breaking down.                                                                                    , Some problems are being addressed. The Biden administration has wiped out $17 billion in debt for 725,000 borrowers by expanding and streamlining forgiveness programs for public servants and those who were defrauded by their schools, among others. Last week, it offered millions of borrowers added credit toward forgiveness because of previous payment-counting problems.                                     , But there’s much still to do. The Education Department was deluged by applicants after it expanded eligibility for millions of public servants. And settlement talks in a class-action suit by nearly 200,000 borrowers who say they were defrauded by their schools recently broke down, setting up a trial this summer.                                                                                              , Even the logistics of collecting payments have grown more complicated. Two big loan servicers quit last year, forcing the Education Department to shift millions of borrowers to new vendors — a process that is likely to take the rest of the year.                                                                                                                                                                  , The six remaining servicers got another curveball from the Biden administration this month: Seven million people who have defaulted on their loans — nearly one in five of all federal debtors — will be restored to good standing.                                                                                                                                                                                    , Canceling debt could make addressing all this easier, advocates say. Forgiving $10,000 per borrower would wipe out the debts of 10 million or more people, according to different analyses, which would free up resources to deal with structural flaws, proponents argue.                                                                                                                                             , “We’ve known for years that the system is broken,” said Sarah Sattelmeyer, a higher-education project director at New America, a think tank. “Having an opportunity, during this timeout, to start fixing some of those major issues feels like a place where the Education Department should be focusing its attention.”                                                                                              , Voters like Ashleigh A. Mosley will be watching. Ms. Mosley, 21, a political science major at Albany State University in Georgia, said she had been swayed to vote for Mr. Biden because of his support for debt cancellation.                                                                                                                                                                                         , Ms. Mosley, who also attended Alabama A&amp;M University, has already borrowed $52,000 and expects her balance to grow to $100,000 by the time she graduates. The debt already hangs over her head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “I don’t think I’m going to even have enough money to start a family or buy a house because of the loans,” she said. “It’s just not designed for us to win.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russian energy firm Gazprom has told Poland and Bulgaria it will stop sending gas to the two countries from Wednesday.                                                                                                  , Polish state gas company PGNiG said it had been told all gas deliveries would be halted from 08:00 CET (06:00 GMT).                                                                                                     , The Bulgarian Energy Ministry also said it had been informed deliveries would be suspended from Wednesday.                                                                                                              , It comes after Russia said "unfriendly" countries must start paying for gas in roubles or it would cut supplies.                                                                                                        , Both countries have refused to pay in this way.                                                                                                                                                                         , PGNiG relies on Gazprom for the majority of its gas imports and bought 53% of its imports from the Russian company in the first quarter of this year.                                                                   , It described the suspension as a breach of contract, adding that the company would take steps to reinstate the flow of gas.                                                                                             , Bulgaria, which relies on Gazprom for more than 90% of its gas supply, said it had taken steps to find alternative sources but no restrictions on gas consumption were currently required.                              , The country's energy ministry said Bulgaria had fulfilled its obligations under the current contract with Gazprom and made all required payments.                                                                       , It added that the new payment system proposed by Russia was in breach of the existing contract.                                                                                                                         , Following the news, Poland's climate ministry said the country's energy supplies were secure.                                                                                                                           , Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said there was no need to draw gas from reserves and gas to customers would not be cut.                                                                                                    , Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister, Marcin Przydacz, said his country had been preparing for the possibility Russia might limit gas exports by diversifying its supplies.                                                 , "I'm pretty sure that we will manage to handle this," he told the BBC.                                                                                                                                                  , He added that the suspension proved Moscow was "not a reliable partner in any kind of business" and urged other European nations like Germany to support a ban on Russian energy imports.                               , Poland was already planning to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year, when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires.                                                                              , PGNiG said its underground gas storage was almost 80% full and, with summer approaching, demand was lower.                                                                                                              , Poland also has alternative supply sources, including a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Swinoujscie.                                                                                                            , On 1 May, a new gas pipeline connection with Lithuania is also due to open that will give Poland access to gas from Lithuania's LNG terminal.                                                                           , And a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway, known as the "Baltic Pipe", comes online in October. It should reach full capacity by the end of the year and could replace all Russian deliveries.                      , The gas supply cut does not mean Poland will immediately be unable to meet customer demand.                                                                                                                             , In recent years, Poland has reduced its dependence on Russian gas and it now buys LNG from Qatar and pipelines connect the country to the European market. Plus, the winter heating season is over, so demand is lower. , But Gazprom supplies more than half of all Poland's gas imports. That's a big hole to fill.                                                                                                                             , And Poland is not the only EU country now seeking to stop buying Russian energy.                                                                                                                                        , There's a lot of competition on an already tight gas supply market. When the heating season starts again in the autumn and demand rises, Poland could face a tricky few months securing enough supply.                  , And if it does so, it may have to restrict supplies to large industrial users.                                                                                                                                          , Supplies from Russia account for about 40% of the EU's natural gas imports.                                                                                                                                             , However, many countries have pledged to move away from Russian energy in response to its invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                           , The US has declared a complete ban on Russian oil, gas and coal imports.                                                                                                                                                , Meanwhile, the UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible, and the EU is reducing gas imports by two-thirds.                                                         , Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate                                                                                                                                                                    , Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars                                                                                                                                                                      , Alexei Navalny, Russia's opposition leader, uncovers the truth                                                                                                                                                          , © 2022 BBC.

       stock rose more than 4% in the extended session Tuesday after the EV maker said it had reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia to sell up to 100,000 vehicles over a 10-year period to Saudi Arabia's government, including an initial commitment to buy 50,000 vehicles. That is "another pivotal moment in our acceleration of sustainable transportation worldwide," Chief Executive Peter Rawlinson said in a statement. Lucid said that Saudi Arabia is committing to buy the luxury Lucid Air and other future models built and assembled at Lucid's existing Arizona plant and the EV maker's future plant in Saudi Arabia. Lucid is expected to sell between 1,000 EVs to 2,000 EVs annually, increasing to between 4,000 EVs and 7,000 EVs by 2025. "This will support the government's drive to diversify the economy, provide thousands of highly skilled job opportunities and provide economic benefit" to the kingdom, the company said. A Saudi Arabian investment fund owns more than half of Lucid.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russia will shut off gas supplies to Poland, state-run company says  - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> London (CNN Business)In a dramatic escalation of tensions with the West, Russian energy giant Gazprom informed Poland's state-run gas firm PGNiG said that it will "entirely suspend" gas supplies along the Yamal pipeline starting  Wednesday morning, PGNiG said in a statement on Tuesday.                                   , "On April 26, Gazprom informed PGNiG of its intention to entirely suspend deliveries under the Yamal contract at the beginning of the contract day on April 27," the statement read.                                                                                                                                             , The news sent US natural gas futures up about 3% Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Gazprom did not confirm that the supply of Russian gas to Poland had been stopped, Russian state news agency TASS reported Tuesday, citing the company's spokesperson Sergey Kupriyanov.                                                                                                                                         , Kupriyanov, however, emphasized that Poland must pay for Russian gas supplies in rubles, a demand Warsaw has refused.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Russia delivered an ultimatum last month to "unfriendly" nations that they must pay for their energy in rubles starting April 1 or risk being cut off from vital supplies. But the flow of gas has continued.                                                                                                                    , The Kremlin said payments for gas being delivered at the time of its announcement would fall due toward the end of April or the beginning of May, which is why Russia didn't immediately shut off the flow of gas to Europe.                                                                                                     , President Vladimir Putin's high-stakes threat has sent shockwaves through Europe, which cannot keep its economy running for long without Russian energy. Moscow sent a clear signal that it could at some point reduce natural gas flows — perhaps to deter or respond to even tougher Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine., PGNiG said it's prepared to obtain gas from various directions, including through gas connections on its western and southern borders and the liquefied natural gas terminal (LNG) in the northwest port city of Swinoujscie.                                                                                                    , It also said its underground gas storage is almost 80% full.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "The balance sheet is supplemented by domestic gas production and fuel reserves accumulated in underground gas storage facilities. Currently, the warehouse filling level is around 80 percent and is significantly higher than in the corresponding period in previous years," it added.                                        , The Polish gas firm said that currently all deliveries to customers are carried out in accordance with their needs, adding that the company is monitoring the situation and is prepared for various scenarios.                                                                                                                   , Poland's Climate Minister Anna Moskwa affirmed on Tuesday that there will be no shortage of gas in Poland despite the Russian halt of exports.                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security - we have been effectively independent of Russia for years," she said in a tweet.                                                                                                                                                         , "There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes," the minister wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , -- CNN's Anna Odzeniak and Uliana Pavlova contributed to this report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , </td>

The Nasdaq Composite sunk 4% and hit a fresh 52-week low, retreating further into bear territory and sitting now about 23% off its high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 800 points and the S&amp;P 500 was down 2.8%. The selloff was the most pronounced among the tech, consumer discretionary, and banks.

Also, Tesla sunk more than 11%, a day after the company’s chief executive and largest shareholder Elon Musk closed a deal to buy Twitter. </td>

They have been delayed until July and there have been suggestions they might be put back again.                                                                                                                                                                                              , While exports to the EU appear to have recovered after falling earlier in 2021, the authors argue that this reflects an increase in sales of costly large machinery.                                                                                                                                                                                    , The total variety of goods sold has declined by 30% - perhaps because the cost of extra administration making selling low-value items less attractive for smaller businesses.                                                                                                                                                                           , The government may have its ambitions sighted further afield for Global Britain  - deepening ties with the US, and the growing Pacific Rim nations  - but two-fifths of the UK's overseas customers remain closer to home, in the EU.                                                                                                                   , The recovery in level of exports towards the end of last year suggests many British exporters have successfully got to grips with the extra red tape - paperwork and checks. But that rebound partly reflects the sale of bulky, expensive items such as machinery.                                                                                     , Beyond that, a sharp drop in the variety of goods sold tallies with surveys which have shown some smaller exporters, particularly those selling lower value items, may have given up selling to Europe as the costs of the formalities prove prohibitive.                                                                                               , That's problematic for two reasons. First because it's those small exporters which are the engine of trade growth, the success stories of tomorrow. And second, as the government's own forecasters note, the new trade agreements struck with the likes of Australia and New Zealand are not yet sufficient to greatly boost the UK's trade prospects. , It's a reminder, even as exporters discover new markets, that reducing obstacles in existing ones remains an issue for some.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The government's fiscal watchdog recently said that the UK had "missed out" on much of the post-pandemic economic rebound enjoyed by other countries in the G7 due to Brexit.                                                                                                                                                                           , The CEP's report does, however, only analyse the first year of trade under the new Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and does not capture long-term effects.                                                                                                                                                                                        , Martin McTague, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said more should be done to help businesses with increased paperwork, adding: "Small business must be at the centre of free trade agreements."                                                                                                                                             , A government spokesman said that it was supporting firms that trade with Europe as well as helping them "seize new opportunities" presented by new trade deals.                                                                                                                                                                                         , "Given the impact of Covid-19 on global supply chains, we have been introducing import controls in phases throughout 2022 in order to give businesses more time to prepare," they added.                                                                                                                                                                , "Through our targeted multimedia campaign and a series of sector-based webinars, businesses are also signposted to the relevant import information and support to help them."                                                                                                                                                                           , Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Alexei Navalny, Russia's opposition leader, uncovers the truth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cost of living crisis: Changes to childcare and MOT rules considered to help budgets </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Ministers have pitched ideas to tackle the cost of living, as record inflation pushes up food and energy prices.                                                                                                                                        , Boris Johnson called for proposals from his team - that do not rely on spending taxpayers' money - during Tuesday's cabinet meeting.                                                                                                                    , The BBC has learned that the PM said he wanted to reduce childcare costs by easing health and safety rules.                                                                                                                                             , And sources said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested relaxing the frequency of MOTs.                                                                                                                                                             , Delays at the Passport Office were also raised, with Mr Johnson threatening to privatise the service if it did not start delivering better value for money.                                                                                             , Opposition parties have said the help on offer from the government to tackle rising living costs was insufficient, with Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats calling for an emergency Budget to give more support to households.                   , With inflation at a 30-year high and household bills continuing to rise, No 10 says the PM has asked ministers to come up with "innovative ways" to ease living costs.                                                                                  , One of the proposals came from the PM himself, with sources saying he wanted to lower the legal limits on adult supervision for children in England, as part of a drive to reduce living costs.                                                         , A source in the meeting said Mr Johnson had joked about knowing about the high cost of childcare - he has fathered at least seven children - before telling ministers the government had to get on with reducing costs.                                 , Current legal requirements in England say there must be at least one member of staff for every three children in groups aged two years and under.                                                                                                       , For two-year-olds and over, there must be one member of staff for every four children.                                                                                                                                                                  , The Liberal Democrat and Conservative coalition government attempted to relax child-to-staff ratios in England as part of a package of reforms in 2013.                                                                                                 , But the plans - spearheaded by then-education minister Liz Truss - were abandoned after they were opposed by Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister at the time.                                                                                     , Earlier this month, experts warned the government against relaxing nursery staffing rules as ministers reviewed ways to improve the cost, choice and availability of childcare.                                                                         , Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the proposal would "drive down quality whilst making no difference to availability".                                                                                                        , And Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said Mr Johnson has chosen to "cut corners and endanger our children", instead of addressing this issue "head on".                                                                                     , Another proposal presented to cabinet came from Mr Shapps, who suggested reducing the need for an annual MOT.                                                                                                                                           , Every vehicle that is three-years-old or over must have a current MOT test certificate and drivers must renew this once a year, costing up to £54.85 for a car and £29.65 for a standard motorcycle.                                                    , Two cabinet sources told the BBC that Mr Shapps suggested reducing the need for renewal to every two years, rather than one, to cut costs for households.                                                                                               , Motoring organisation the AA has come out against the idea, arguing it could in fact make costs worse for drivers due to higher repair bills, as well as reducing road safety.                                                                          , The prime minister's official spokesman said Chancellor Rishi Sunak "underlined the importance" of not fuelling further inflation during the cabinet meeting, and that departmental budgets "are set" with no plans to currently go beyond these limits., But Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the meeting showed the PM was "completely out of ideas during the most profound crisis in decades".                                                                                                                , He added: "Whilst families are facing sky rocketing bills and soaring inflation, Boris Johnson's answer is another quiz night at No 10."                                                                                                                , Sir Ed echoed Labour and the SNP's call for an emergency budget, including a cut in VAT, and backed opposition plans for a windfall tax on the profits of the oil and gas companies.                                                                    , What is striking about some of the proposals ministers have pitched to ease the cost of living is they don't require any cash to be spent.                                                                                                              , Instead, they involve cutting rules and regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , This marks a significant political shift.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , For the past two years, the government has intervened with financial support on a number of fronts to help households and businesses through the pandemic.                                                                                              , Ministers are concerned about the government debt that has accrued, and are now looking for ways to help people with rising bills without necessarily having to spend more cash.                                                                        , Some government sources say ministers want less regulation and intervention from the state in people's lives - a more traditional Conservative approach, with ministers also looking at what "red tape" they can cut post-Brexit.                       , But this change of tune has caused a backlash from government critics.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Opposition parties have accused them of sacrificing health and safety regulations and "endangering" people in the process.                                                                                                                              , And others say cutting rules and regulations won't go far enough to helping people with spiralling bills now.                                                                                                                                           , It comes as Labour has warned of a £10bn hike in annual petrol and diesel costs, with "soaring" prices putting the squeeze on household budgets.                                                                                                        , "Labour's plan would help households through this crisis with up to £600 cut off energy bills, funded by a one-off windfall tax on the booming profits of oil and gas producers," said Labour's shadow secretary of state for transport, Louise Haigh.  , The SNP called for an emergency budget earlier this month, saying the Tories had ignored the cost-of-living crisis.                                                                                                                                     , The Green Party has also accused the government of failing voters on living costs, and campaigned for insulation projects to reduce energy needs and keep homes warm.                                                                                   , Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Alexei Navalny, Russia's opposition leader, uncovers the truth                                                                                                                                                                                          , © 2022 BBC.

       Chief Executive Donnie King said beef prices aren't rising because the packaged meats company just decided to raise prices, but because of "market forces" including strong demand, COVID-19-related labor shortages that constrained production and record inflation. "Tyson does not set the prices for either the cattle we buy or the beer our customers purchase," King said, in prepared testimony to Congress ahead of a U.S. House Agriculture Committee meeting scheduled for Wednesday. He blamed "basic economics" for the price increases, which states that when demand is high and supply is low, prices will rise, "which is precisely what they did." He noted that since March 2020, the cost of corn is up 127% and the cost of soybeans is up 90%, and both are used in livestock feed, which comprises 65% of the cost of chicken and about 30% of the cost of finished beef.

It just keeps getting worse," Dunleavy told host Neil Cavuto. "And we're still scratching our head as to where these ideas and where this policy is coming from."                                                                                                            , Oil rebounded on Tuesday afternoon, with U.S. crude rising to the $102 per barrel level, while Brent, the global benchmark, hit $105.                                                                                                                                                                           , However, recently oil prices have fallen on expectations of weaker demand after peaking above $130 per barrel last month due to anxiety about the disruption of supplies from Russia, the world's No. 2 exporter.                                                                                               , Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy argues that the American energy situation "keeps getting worse" because of the Biden administration’s energy stance.  (AP/iStock / AP Images)                                                                                                                                     , Dunleavy told "Cavuto: Coast to Coast" last month that his state is ready to increase oil and gas production amid escalating tension overseas if the Biden administration allows.                                                                                                                               , In a series of orders aimed at combating climate change, President Biden temporarily suspended the issuance of oil and gas permits on federal lands and waters and canceled the Keystone XL oil pipeline project on his first day in office.                                                                    , According to the Energy Information Administration, Alaska's proved crude oil reserves of 2.4 billion barrels are the fourth largest of any state and Alaska ranks third in the country in natural gas gross withdrawals.                                                                                       , Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy argues that Biden’s energy policies are causing ‘chaos’ and an oil price surge.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Dunleavy argued on Tuesday that "the chaos and uncertainty right now in the world with the war in Europe" and the "potential COVID lockdowns in China" will impact oil prices, but stressed that "what started this was the Biden administration's war on fossil fuels and their desire to go renewable."       , He noted that he is for an "all-in energy approach," which includes renewables, but not shutting down oil and gas; Dunleavy explained his rationale, saying, "as was demonstrated in Europe, especially Germany, you have to have a bridge."                                                                    , "You have to have a coherent policy to get from here to there and what we're seeing is a lot of chaos, a lot of uncertainty," Dunleavy explained. "And I think you're going to see prices all over the map."                                                                                                    , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> MeWe founder Mark Weinstein says Tesla CEO Elon Musk will face a ‘challenge’ with operating two large companies after $44 billion Twitter offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Congressional Democrats sounded the alarm this week after Tesla CEO Elon Musk struck a deal to buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion and take the social media company private.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Among the lawmakers' chief concerns was that Musk could allow former President Donald Trump, who was permanently banned from Twitter in January 2021 after spreading misinformation about the 2020 election, back onto the platform.                                                                                                                                                                           , ELON MUSK TO BUY TWITTER FOR $44 BILLION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , While Musk has not said whether he plans to lift Trump's Twitter ban, the tech executive is a frequent citric of the platform, which he has previously accused of stifling free speech. In the past, Musk, who describes himself as a "free speech absolutist," has proposed relaxing Twitter content restrictions, fueling speculation that Trump could return to his onetime favorite social media website.  , During a recent interview at a TED conference, Musk argued that social media networks should not remove comments that are offensive if they are still legal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "If it's a gray area, let the tweet exist," Musk said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , CEO of Tesla Motors Elon Musk speaks at the Tesla Giga Texas manufacturing "Cyber Rodeo" grand opening party in Austin, Texas, April 7, 2022.  (Suzanne Cordeiro/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Sen. Dick Durbin, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was among the Democrats who expressed concern about what Musk's purchase of Twitter means for the former president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "He said he wants it to be a global message board," Durbin, D-Ill., told reporters Monday. "My first question to him is, 'Is your message board going to include Donald Trump?' You know I think that's a good question. If he just lets that man run the rail on Twitter, it's not in the best interest of Americans."                                                                                        , Durbin said that his and other panels are investigating whether it would be appropriate to impose new regulations on tech platforms to encourage them to moderate content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Still, Trump has denied that he will get back on the platform if Musk reinstates him, insisting he intends to remain on his own social media website, Truth Social.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "I am not going on Twitter. I am going to stay on Truth," Trump told Fox News Monday. "I hope Elon buys Twitter because he'll make improvements to it, and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth."                                                                                                                                                                                           , The White House declined to comment on the acquisition, but press secretary Jen Psaki said President Biden has long been concerned about the platform of social media companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the nomination of Chris Magnus to be the next U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill Oct. 19, 2021.

"The president has long talked about his concerns about the power of social media platforms, including Twitter and others, to spread misinformation."                                                                                                                                                                                                 , That sentiment was reiterated by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the biggest advocates for breaking up major technology companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google. She called Musk's purchase of Twitter "dangerous for our democracy."                                                                                                                                                                         , Warren suggested there should be additional antitrust regulations put in place regarding Twitter and other social media platforms in order to make it easier for other companies to compete with them. In doing that, the platforms would pose a "lot smaller risk to our democracy," she said.                                                                                                                , Tesla has once again been subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission over CEO Elon Musk’s Twitter habits.

"And that means one person can literally turn upside down how millions of people across this country communicate. It's also a reminder of why we need a wealth tax in America."                                                                                            , The Massachusetts Democrat has been a fierce critic of Musk and other billionaires and has repeatedly advocated for a wealth tax on the wealthiest U.S households. The two have exchanged barbs on Twitter in the past, with Warren accusing Musk of "freeloading off of everyone else," and Musk responding by insulting her as "Senator Karen."                                                              , Fox News' Kelly Phares contributed to this report  </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The war in Ukraine is set to cause the "largest commodity shock" since the 1970s, the World Bank has warned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In a new forecast, it said disruption caused by the conflict would contribute to huge price rises for goods ranging from natural gas to wheat and cotton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The increase in prices "is starting to have very large economic and humanitarian effects", Peter Nagle, a co-author of the report, told the BBC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , He said "households across the world are feeling the cost of living crisis".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "We're particularly worried about the poorest households since they spend a larger share of income on food and energy, so they're particularly vulnerable to this price spike," the senior economist at the World Bank added.                                                                                                                                             , Energy prices are set to increase more than 50%, pushing up bills for households and businesses, the World Bank says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The biggest rise will be in the price of natural gas in Europe, which is set to more than double in cost. Prices are forecast to fall next year and in 2024, but even then will remain 15% higher than they were last year.                                                                                                                                               , The World Bank said this means that from the lows of April 2020 until the highs of March this year we have seen "the largest 23-month increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil price hike", when tensions in the Middle East sent prices soaring.                                                                                                                     , Similarly oil prices are expected to remain elevated into 2024 with a barrel of the benchmark measure, Brent Crude, projected to average $100 this year, something which will lead to widespread inflation.                                                                                                                                                               , Russia produces about 11% of the world's oil, the third biggest share, but the report said "disruptions resulting from the war are expected to having a lasting negative effect" as sanctions mean that foreign companies leave and access to technology is reduced.                                                                                                      , Russia currently provides 40% of the EU's gas and 27% of its oil, but European governments are moving to wean their countries off of supplies from Russia. That has helped push up global prices by creating more demand for supplies from elsewhere.                                                                                                                     , The World Bank commodity outlook also warned many foods are set to see steep rises in their costs. The UN food prices index already shows they are at their highest since records began 60 years ago.                                                                                                                                                                     , Wheat is forecast to increase 42.7% and reach new record highs in dollar terms. Other notable increases will be 33.3% for barley, 20% for soybeans and 29.8% for oils and 41.8% for chicken. These increases reflect the fact that exports from Ukraine and Russia have fallen drastically.                                                                               , Before the war the two countries accounted for 28.9% of global wheat exports according to JP Morgan, and 60% of global sunflower supplies - a key ingredient in many processed foods - according to S&amp;P Global.                                                                                                                                                           , Prices for other raw materials including fertilisers, metals and minerals are also predicted to go up. The costs of timber, tea and rice are amongst the few expected to fall.                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Wheat is one of the hardest agriculture exports to replace," according to a research note from the Bank of America. It points out that poor weather conditions in North America and China are likely to exacerbate the impact of Ukrainian supplies being reduced, something which will continue because the war has disrupted the spring planting season.               , The note also suggests grain and oilseed shipments from Ukraine have fallen more than 80% because of the fighting and these lost exports, over the course of a year, "equate to about 10 days of world food supply".                                                                                                                                                      , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world's four big food commodity traders, said he does not expect prices to come down soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , As the US firm announced a 53% increase in net earnings for the first three month of this year, to $1.05bn, Juan Luciano said: "We expect reduced crop supplies - caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops, and now the disruptions in the Black Sea region - to drive continued tightness in global grain markets for the next few years"., Mr Nagle, from the World Bank, said other countries can help solve the supply shortage caused by Ukraine's war in the medium term. However a forecast 69% increase in fertiliser prices this year means "there's a real risk that as farmers start to use fewer fertilisers, agricultural yields will decline".                                                           , For commodities overall, the World Bank report said: "While prices generally are expected to peak in 2022, they are to remain much higher than previously forecast."                                                                                                                                                                                                      , It added that "the outlook for commodity markets depends heavily on the duration of the war in Ukraine" and the disruption it causes to supply chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards debate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Louis Theroux on storytelling and the culture wars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Alexei Navalny, Russia's opposition leader, uncovers the truth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Twitter is usually awash with topics for discussion, but over the past couple of days one has stood out on the platform above others - what does the future hold for Twitter itself?                                                                                                                                                                                                    , With Elon Musk set to purchase the site - subject to shareholders' approval - for $44bn (£35bn), tweeters across the world have been offering their opinions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , No-one knows exactly what the billionaire entrepreneur has planned, with even Twitter boss Parag Agrawal acknowledging the future is uncertain. But the world's richest man has given some clues.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr Musk has long been vocal in his criticism of the platform's content policies, and there is speculation he could tweak Twitter's moderation rules and allow suspended accounts to return - such as that of former US President Donald Trump.                                                                                                                                          , As his takeover was approved by Twitter's board, the billionaire said that free speech was the "bedrock" of a functioning democracy and hailed the platform as the "digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated".                                                                                                                                     , Mr Musk has previously described himself as a "free speech absolutist", but his exact view of the concept is unclear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , He has also blocked people on the platform who have criticised him or his companies in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , If the billionaire does loosen Twitter's content moderation rules, he could be in for a "rude awakening", says Jeffrey Howard, associate professor at University College London.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Twitter could be "easily weaponised" by criminals, bots and people using it for "malicious purposes" and to "incite hate and violence", Mr Howard warns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "I think Elon Musk is relatively naïve on the actual challenges involved in content moderation.

And with tough new regulation to tackle online abuse on the horizon, such as the UK's government's Online Harms Bill, it is unclear what changes Mr Musk will be able to make.                                                                                 , News of the takeover has already split political opinion in the US.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , People on the right, who feel unfairly targeted by social media platforms, have welcomed the deal. Those on the left have been more critical, with Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren calling it "dangerous for our democracy".                                                                                                                                                          , Peter Vidlicka, media expert and co-founder of the public relations website Newspage, said that while Mr Musk could help Twitter "get its mojo back", "in the current socio-cultural climate, we can expect fireworks in the months ahead".                                                                                                                                             , After becoming Twitter's largest shareholder earlier in April, Mr Musk posted in a series of now-deleted tweets suggesting he'd like to get rid of adverts on Twitter's premium subscription service Twitter Blue.                                                                                                                                                                      , "The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive," Mr Musk wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Although the entrepreneur might have cited concerns about advertisers' influence over Twitter policy, the platform currently relies on adverts for about 90% of its income.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In results for the three months to the end of December, Twitter said its revenue reached $1.57bn, with adverts making up $1.41bn - both up 22% year-on-year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Mr Musk suggested improvements could be made to Twitter Blue, which could be relied on as an alternative source of income.

has spoken of "defeating the spam bots", one pledge that is likely to be extremely popular with Twitter users.

with automated, fake accounts being used to relentlessly post unhelpful or misleading content.

firm ExtraHop, says that while removing the Twitter bots seems like a huge task, if Mr Musk is successful "the methods used by Twitter to eliminate bots from the platform may generate new techniques that improve the detection and identification of spam emails, spam posts and other malicious intrusion attempts" more widely., However, Robin Mansell, professor of new media and the internet at the London School of Economics, says there will "always be errors" in the authentication of users by humans or algorithms.

says.

which these companies have to pay respect when they operate internationally."                                                                                                                                                                                          , Before his bid for Twitter, Mr Musk asked his followers if they wanted an edit button in a Twitter poll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , It led to Twitter confirming that it was already working on a such a feature, which would allow users to change tweets after they have been posted.

Microsoft's earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, but the stock remained flat in extended trading.                                    , The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped about 4%, further retreating into bear-market territory. It's now 22% off of its high, and posted a 52-week low Tuesday. The S&amp;P fell by 2.8%.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell indicated last Friday that there will likely be aggressive interest rate hikes next month, the Dow fell about 980 points, or 2.8%. The rate increases are meant to quell runaway inflation, but investors are more worried that an interest rate spike will slow consumer spending and the housing market, ushering in the next recession. , Fast-growing tech stocks are closely linked to the decisions of the Federal Reserve. These rate-sensitive companies have high price-to-earnings ratios because they're typically valued on future profits and pay no dividends. Higher rates mean that future earnings will be worth less than they are today.                                                                          , Cyclical stocks also dropped Tuesday.

China is a big customer in the US tech and semiconductor markets.                                                                                                                                                                    , Investors also remain worried about the geopolitical turmoil linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A top Russian official said Tuesday that the threat of nuclear war is real.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The CNN Business Fear &amp; Greed Index, which measures seven indicators of market sentiment, fell deeper into fear mode Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> EU Natural Gas Rebounds as Russia Cuts Flows to Poland </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> EU natural gas futures rose as much as 17% on Tuesday to above €100 per megawatt-hour mark after it was reported that Russia will halt gas deliveries to Poland tomorrow. Earlier in the day Polish energy adviser Naimski said PGNiG ( the Polish gas distributor) would not comply with a Russian request to pay for gas in rubles. Currently, 55 percent of Poland's gas imports come from Russia but Poland took already several steps to cut its reliance including the expansion of a terminal in Swinoujscie in northwestern Poland and building a new pipeline from Norway. </td>

CEO Lawrence Culp said GE is "trending toward the low end" of its guidance due in part to inflation pressure. Additionally, pressures from supply chain issues, the war in Ukraine and the spread of Covid hurt GE's revenue by six percentage points, Culp said.                                              , Sherwin-Williams — Shares of the paint company jumped more than 9% after the company beat Wall Street estimates for its first-quarter earnings.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB index pared earlier gains and closed 1% lower at 23,681 on Tuesday, extending the previous session’s decline to a two-month low, amid concerns that strict Covid lockdowns in China could extend to Beijing. Growth jitters due to risks of factory closures in China pressured the auto sector in Milan, with Stellantis declining 3.2% and Pirelli falling 2.5%. The financial sector also ended lower, as seen with a 3.2% loss for UniCredit. On the other hand, utilities continued to outperform the index, with a 0.7% gain from A2a as the Italian government pushes for alternative suppliers of natural gas to exit their dependency on Russia. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South African Stocks Snap 4-Day Losing Run </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index closed 0.7% up at 70,264 on Tuesday, after four consecutive sessions of losses, helped by a recovery in commodity stocks, with the mining index up 1.1%. Still, concerns over the pandemic in China and a comeback of problems related to South Africa’s power generation limited gains. State-owned utility Eskom, which holds a monopoly over the country’s power supply, urged consumers to cut electricity consumption after losing several generators over the weekend, which could result in more blackouts. On the corporate side, private hospital operator Netcare said its earnings for the six months ended 31 March 2022, increased between 8.5% and 9%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Elon Musk warned he must protect Twitter users </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Elon Musk has been warned he must protect Twitter users from harmful content after he struck a $44bn deal to buy the social media giant.                                                                                     , The billionaire vowed to relax content restrictions, sparking fears from human rights groups it could lead to a rise in bullying and misinformation.                                                                         , "Regardless of ownership, all social media platforms must be responsible," Boris Johnson's spokesman said.                                                                                                                   , The European Commission also warned Mr Musk that he must protect users.                                                                                                                                                      , "Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules - regardless of their shareholding," Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the EU executive, warned in a tweet., The European Union has said its new online rules will "overhaul" the digital market, including how tech giants operate.                                                                                                      , Once they come into force, there will need to be greater transparency around why content is recommended to users, or why they are being targeted with certain ads, for example.                                              , Mr Musk, who is a self-described "free speech absolutist", has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's policies on moderating content, arguing that it needs to be a genuine forum for free speech.                         , "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," he said on announcing the deal.                                   , The social media firm faces growing pressure from politicians and regulators over the content that appears on its platform. It has drawn critics from left and right over its efforts to mediate misinformation.             , In one of its most high-profile moves, last year it banned former US President Donald Trump, perhaps its most powerful user, citing the risk of "incitement of violence".                                                    , But in a series of tweets Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who still sits on the firm's board, welcomed Mr Musk's takeover, describing him as "the singular solution I trust".                                                   , He said the firm had been "owned" by Wall Street and that Mr Musk's decision to delist the shares and take it private was the "correct first step".                                                                          , Twitter "will continue to serve the public conversation", he said, but added he did not believe "anyone should own or run Twitter".                                                                                          , But in a Twitter thread, Amnesty International said: "We are concerned with any steps that Twitter might take to erode enforcement of the policies and mechanisms designed to protect users.                                 , "The last thing we need is a Twitter that wilfully turns a blind eye to violent and abusive speech against users, particularly those most disproportionately impacted, including women, non-binary persons, and others."     , Twitter did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on the concerns raised.                                                                                                                                     , The 11-member board of Twitter unanimously agreed to Mr Musk's $44bn (£34.5bn) offer.                                                                                                                                        , Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal has also addressed employees at a meeting, where he said the future of the company was uncertain.                                                                                      , "Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go," Mr Agrawal reportedly said.                                                                                                                      , Mr Musk said that he hopes even his strongest critics will remain on the platform "because that is what free speech means".                                                                                                  , However, some users have threatened to leave Twitter, while others have already quit.                                                                                                                                        , British actor Jameela Jamil, who is best known for her role in TV series The Good Place, said she expects the platform to "become an even more lawless, hateful, xenophobic, bigoted, misogynistic space".                   , "I would like this to be my... last tweet," Ms Jamil told her one million followers.                                                                                                                                         , Meanwhile, Caroline Orr Bueno, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland, said that for now she will stay on the platform, where she has more than 450,000 followers.                                         , Ms Bueno said "we have no idea what it will look like under Elon Musk's leadership".

                                                                                               , Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, told the BBC that he expected most users to "take a wait-and-see approach".                                                                                      , "Now it's about courting new users and stopping defectors from the platform," Mr Ives said.                                                                                                                                  , On Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters that US President Joe Biden "has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms", regardless of whoever owns or runs Twitter.              , Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren said the deal was "dangerous for our democracy", while pushing for a wealth tax and "strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable".                                                           , Meanwhile, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn welcomed the agreement as "an encouraging day for freedom of speech".

Corporate profits rocketed by 35 percent in 2021, and profit margins were at their widest since 1950. Yet stocks have been hammered lately: Two key stock indexes, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, have been deep in negative terrain since the start of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , What may seem a contradiction is actually a historical pattern: Hot labor markets and hot stock markets often don’t mix well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In fact, times of low unemployment are correlated with somewhat subdued stock returns, while valuations trend higher on average during periods of high unemployment. Analysts explain this phenomenon as a plain function of the unemployment rate’s status as a “lagging indicator” — letting people know how the economy was faring in the immediate past — while the stock market itself constantly serves as a “leading indicator,” coldly, if somewhat imperfectly, projecting an evolving consensus about the fate of companies as time goes on.                                                                                                                                       , “When unemployment is ultra low, the uppity times are behind us, and when it’s super high, there are good times ahead,” said Padhraic Garvey, a head of research at ING, a global bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Average annual returns in the S&amp;P 500 index from 1948 to 2022, by the concurrent rate of unemployment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Note: The S&amp;P 500 index was formally introduced in 1957.

Stocks plunged during the financial crisis the next year — and then, in 2009, as unemployment ripped higher to 10 percent, the index gained 26.5 percent. (Breaks in the pattern occur, since various tailwinds for big business, such as the tech boom of the 1990s, can briefly overpower historical trends.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , When recoveries peak, investor exuberance can lead to excessive risk taking by businesses, which plants the seeds of the next downturn — just as workers are benefiting from being in high demand, with their higher wages cutting into corporate cash piles built up during good times, putting pressure on near-term profits. Financial investors also have to contend with the Federal Reserve’s response to the cycle — if there’s inflation, as there is now, a strong labor market may give it room to raise interest rates. A weak one can pressure it to cut rates. Action in either direction affects stock valuations.                                                             , This year, in addition to those forces, the war in Ukraine has slowed global growth

executives at Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent note that their “strategists see higher wages amid the tightening labor market and related labor shortages posing a risk to 2022 corporate profit margins,” adding a reminder that “what matters for markets isn’t always the same as what matters for the aggregate economy.”

Yellen, have become more wary of their brisk pace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , After-tax profits for U.S. corporations, seasonally adjusted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Notes: Profits are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation, minus capital consumption adjustment or inventory valuation adjustment (IVA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Sources: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In the nonfinancial “real” economy, intense competition for workers that leads to greater choice and compensation is positive “because we’re making more money, we have more money to spend, we can absorb inflation better because we’ve gotten raises,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, a San Francisco-based financial services company. At the same time, she acknowledged, “The other thing with a tight labor market is that when wages increase somebody has to pay for that.”                                                                                                                                                                                   , Through most of the swift recovery from the pandemic-induced recession, money managers made a simple bet on the strengthening labor market as a signal that more people earning more disposable income would lead to even more spending on goods and services sold by the companies they trade, enhancing their future earnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Now, the calculus on Wall Street isn’t so simple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In the coming months, many financial analysts say they’ll pay less attention to data on job creation and focus instead on growth in average hourly earnings — cheering for them to flatten or at least moderate, so that labor costs can ebb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , S&amp;P 500 daily close through April 26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , After three years of outsized returns, the down year in markets is compounding the sour mood among the nation’s broadly defined middle class, whose wage gains have generally not kept up with inflation, and whose retirement savings and net worth (outside of home equity) are partly tied to such indexes. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has been hovering near lows not reached since the slow jobs recovery after the 2008 financial crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ultimately, this cranky disconnect between strong jobs data and the national mood may stem from an initial lag between relative winners and losers in this robust-but-rocky recovery: The economic benefits of tightening an already-tight labor market are, in the short run, relatively concentrated — accruing to those with lower starting wages and less formal education, and to demographic cohorts like Black Americans, who are often “last hired, first fired” during business cycles. In the meantime, the downsides of even temporary high inflation are diffuse — spread broadly across the population, though frequently damaging the finances of lower-income groups the most., It remains true that the increased demand for labor has helped millions of workers come out ahead. After adjusting for inflation, wages have fallen for middle- and high-income groups but risen for the bottom third of earners on average: The wages of the typically lower-paid employees of the leisure and hospitality industry — the broad sector focused on travel, dining, entertainment, recreation and tourism — have risen nearly 15 percent over the past year, far outpacing inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                         , A substantial bloc of economists are contending that wages are receiving too much blame for inflation. A recent analysis across 110 industries by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank based in Washington, concluded that wage growth wasn’t correlated with the surge in costs that suppliers dealt with last year, suggesting that much of inflation could still be stemming from other forces, like supply chain imbalances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Many analysts believe that if unemployment stays low enough for long enough, the fruits of a hot labor market will widen — creating a virtuous cycle in which employers increase pay for various rungs of workers, while economizing their business models to become more efficient, increasing capacity, productivity and the health of corporate balance sheets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , That hope is under threat, as the Federal Reserve proceeds with a plan to increase borrowing costs by quickly raising interest rates to rein in some lending, consumer spending, business investment and demand for labor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Despite various challenges, the most optimistic market participants predict that employers, workers and consumers can experience a so-called “soft landing” this year, in which the Fed increases borrowing costs, helping inflation and wage growth moderate without a painful slowdown that kills off the recovery: Morgan Stanley strategists, for instance, expect real wages to turn positive overall by midyear, outpacing price increases, as inflation eases and pay rates maintain some strength. That could be a boon for stocks as well.                                                                                                                                          , “It’s possible that over the next few quarters the labor market continues to be tight despite the Fed hiking,” said Andrew Flowers, a labor economist at Appcast, a tech firm that helps companies target recruitment ads. He still sees an “overwhelming appetite” for hiring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Although especially low unemployment isn’t typically a bullish sign for stocks, some recent years have bucked the trend. In 2019, when the S&amp;P 500 returned roughly 30 percent, unemployment by year’s end had fallen to 3.6 percent, in line with present levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , In such an uncertain environment, forecasts for how stocks will fare by the end of the year are varying widely among top Wall Street firms. By several technical measures, the market’s trajectory is currently near “make or break” levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Public companies have “become massively efficient, so from an operating performance basis, they’ve been able to take on these extra costs,” said Brian Belski, the chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. The outlook from Mr. Belski’s bank is among the most confident, with a call that the S&amp;P 500 index will finish 2022 at 5,300 — 27 percent above Tuesday’s close, and far above most estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “At the end of the day, I think for the economy it’s good that we are seeing these sort of wages,” he said. “Don’t ever bet against the U.S. consumer, ever.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The MOEX Russia Index jumped 6.1% to close at 2,318 on Tuesday, recouping loses after sinking to a two-month in the previous session, as investors continued to assess risks surrounding the ongoing war in Ukraine and the potential of a sixth package of sanctions form the EU. Prospects of another rate cut by the Central Bank of Russia this week also aided sentiment, while President Putin proposed reducing the subsidized mortgage rate to 9% from 12%. Banking shares led the gains, with Sberbank surging 9.4% and VTB gaining 5.3%. The energy sector also lifted the index, with Lukoil and Gazprom both closing over 9% higher as EU states are yet to agree on the extent of penalties on Russian energy. In the meantime, TCS Group jumped 8.7%, as investors continue to monitor whether the sanctioned founder Oleg Tinkov will sell his stake. </td>

The index is on track for its worst monthly decline since March 2020, when stocks plunged 12.5 percent as the coronavirus spread around the world, prompting lockdowns and halting economic activity.                                                                                                                                                                             , The steady drop — with only six days of gains in April — has come as investors have confronted a long list of fears: that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates far more quickly than economists had anticipated; that rising prices and wages could erode corporate profits; and that renewed lockdowns in China could become another drag on the global economy.                                                                                       , Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund projected global growth would slow this year to 3.6 percent, from 6.1 percent in 2021. That was before a new Covid outbreak in Beijing raised concerns about more restrictions in China, the world’s second-largest economy, where cities like Shanghai have already been under lockdown for weeks.                                                                                                           , “China slows down the rest of the world if it shuts down,” said Victoria Greene, the chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth, an advisory firm. “If China shuts down, that could shut down commerce, and that slows down overall global demand.”                                                                                                                                                                                                     , On Tuesday, technology stocks led the retreat on Wall Street, ahead of earnings reports from Alphabet, Microsoft and — later in the week — Meta, Amazon and Apple. Shares of all five companies were lower. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted toward tech, fell about 4 percent.                                                                                                                                                                    , Also lower were shares of Tesla, which fell more than 12 percent. The company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, may have to sell a big chunk of his stock in the carmaker to fund his takeover of Twitter. He has pledged $21 billion in cash as part of the deal, in addition to loans. Tesla’s shares are often more volatile than those of other large companies, and they can weigh on the broader S&amp;P 500 when they fall because of the company’s huge valuation., “Tesla investors are worried that Musk might spend too much time trying to fix the social media giant’s problems, and that will take away his laserlike focus in winning the electric vehicle race,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Among the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 was General Electric, which fell 10.3 percent after it said its outlook for the year was “trending toward the low end” of its previous forecast for profits and listed nearly every one of Wall Street’s concerns as a factor.                                                                                                                                                                                          , “We’re experiencing increased pressure from inflation, renewable energy and the Russia-Ukraine war,” H. Lawrence Culp Jr., the company’s chief executive, said on a conference call with investors on Tuesday, when explaining the outlook. “We’re also watching to evolving areas, namely additional supply chain pressure and recent Covid impacts in China.”                                                                                                   , Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion.  Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                               , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                     , Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.                                                                                                                                                              , Concerns over an economic slowdown in the United States and abroad have weighed on investors’ minds all month. Already, companies and consumers have borne higher costs for goods and transportation, with inflation reaching 8.5 percent in the year through March.                                                                                                                                                                                              , But the conflict in Ukraine and the shutdowns in China have also triggered volatility in energy markets, with crude oil surging in early March before retreating slightly in April. That has spilled over into the stock market, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “There’s been a pendulum going back and forth,” said Ms. Greene. “We go from saying oil prices are too high to saying we’re going to see oil prices come down because we don’t have the demand we thought we would see.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Futures for Brent crude, the international standard, were up about 2.5 percent on Tuesday to about $105 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, for June delivery was up 3.2 percent to $101.70 a barrel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Investors are also contending with the Fed’s approach toward raising interest rates in the coming months in efforts to cool down inflation. Although Wall Street was already pricing in several rate increases this year, Fed officials have adopted a more aggressive tone this month about their willingness to raise rates quickly to try and stem inflation, and analysts are worried that the central bank could tip the economy into a recession.           , “The only way to cool off inflation will be to destroy demand and raise unemployment,” said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute. “It won’t be as simple as raising rates as the markets are expecting.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mohammed Hadi contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Advertisement </td>

On the earnings front, Spanish lender Santander reported a 58% jump in net income to €2.54 billion in Q1, above market expectations. At the same time, Enagas posted first-quarter earnings that missed analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The dollar index broke above the 102 mark for the first time since March 2020, buoyed by expectations of faster Federal Reserve policy tightening, while fears about the economic impact of China's Covid-19 lockdowns boosted the dollar's safe-haven appeal. Fed Chair Jerome Powell clarified last week that the central bank remains committed to taming inflation, currently at 40-year highs, while opening the door for a 50bps interest rate hike in May. Investors were also monitoring a worsening COVID-19 situation in China after authorities in Beijing expanded virus testing to most of the city, raising concerns about a lockdown of the capital. 
 The most pronounced buying activity was against the pound, which tumbled to levels not seen since June 2020 against the greenback. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 ended marginally higher at 7,386 on Tuesday, after a three-day selloff that sent the index to the lowest in six weeks, lifted by miners and energy stocks. Investors shifted their attention to the earnings season, despite global growth fears stoked by China's Covid-19 curbs and an expected streak of aggressive policy tightening by central banks. Europe’s largest lender, HSBC, posted a $4.2 billion pre-tax profits in Q1, $1.6 billion lower than in the same period last year, partly due to a $0.6 billion hit from credit losses linked to the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, AB Foods’ first-half profits nearly doubled, helped by a 25% jump in revenues, but warned its clothing unit Primark would not be able to keep low prices due to inflationary pressures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A major recession is coming, Deutsche Bank warns - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN Business)Deutsche Bank raised eyebrows earlier this month by becoming the first major bank to forecast a US recession, albeit a "mild" one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Now, it's warning of a deeper downturn caused by the Federal Reserve's quest to knock down stubbornly high inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "We will get a major recession," Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report to clients on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The problem, according to the bank, is that while inflation may be peaking, it will take a "long time" before it gets back down to the Fed's goal of 2%. That suggests the central bank will raise interest rates so aggressively that it hurts the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                             , "We regard it...as highly likely that the Fed will have to step on the brakes even more firmly, and a deep recession will be needed to bring inflation to heel," Deutsche Bank economists wrote in its report with the ominous title, "Why the coming recession will be worse than expected."                                                                                                                                                            , Behind the curve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Consumer prices spiked by 8.5% in March, the fastest pace in 40 years. The jobs market remains on fire, with Moody's Analytics projecting that the unemployment rate will soon fall to the lowest level since the early 1950s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , To make its case, Deutsche Bank created an index that tracks the distance between inflation and unemployment over the past 60 years and the Fed's stated goals for those metrics. That research, according to the bank, finds that the Fed today is "much further behind the curve" than it has been since the early 1980s, a period when extremely high inflation forced the central bank to raise interest rates to record highs, crushing the economy., History shows the Fed has "never been able to correct" even smaller overshoots of inflation and employment "without pushing the economy into a significant recession," Deutsche Bank said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Given that the job market has "over-tightened" by as much as two percentage points of unemployment, the bank said, "Something stronger than a mild recession will be needed to do the job."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The good news is that Deutsche Bank sees the economy rebounding by mid-2024 as the Fed reverses course in its inflation fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Goldman Sachs: Recession is not inevitable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Of course, no one knows precisely how this will play out. Although Deutsche Bank is pessimistic -- it's the most bearish among major banks on Wall Street -- others contend this gloom-and-doom is overdone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Goldman Sachs concedes it will be "very challenging" to bring down high inflation and wage growth, but stresses that a recession is "not inevitable."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "We do not need a recession but probably do need growth to slow to a somewhat below-potential pace, a path that raises recession risk," Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a report Friday evening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , UBS is similarly hopeful that the economic expansion will continue despite the Fed's shift to inflation-fighting mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Inflation should ease from current levels, and we do not expect a recession from rising interest rates," Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a report on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , War and Covid lockdowns pressure inflation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Deutsche Bank said the most important factor behind its more negative view is the likelihood that inflation will remain "persistently elevated for longer than generally anticipated."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The bank said several developments will contribute to higher-than-feared inflation, including: the reversal of globalization, climate change, further supply-chain disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China and coming increases to inflation expectations that will support actual inflation.                                                                                                                              , "The scourge of inflation has returned and is here to stay," Deutsche Bank said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , If inflation does stay elevated, the Fed will be forced to consider more dramatic interest rate hikes. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-percentage point in March and Chairman Jerome Powell conceded last week that a half-point hike is "on the table" at next week's meeting.                                                                                                                                                               , "It is sorely tempting to take a go-slow approach hoping that the US economy can be landed softly on a sustainable path. This will not happen," Deutsche Bank said. "Our view is that the only way to minimize the economic, financial and societal damage of prolonged inflation is to err on the side of doing too much."                                                                                                                              , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Major European bourses erased early gains to end Tuesday's session in the red, with the benchmark DAX 30 tumbling over 1% to close at an over one-month low of around 13,750, dragged by the defensive sectors, including consumer staples and healthcare. The world economy faces twin growth and inflation shocks stemming from a fresh coronavirus outbreak in China and the Ukraine crisis. A worsening global outlook came on the heels of an aggressive tightening from major central banks to tame inflation that is already running at record highs. On the corporate side, HSBC tumbled over 5% after the bank reported a 27% fall in quarterly profit. AB Foods were down 5% after the company warned it would raise prices to cope with runaway inflation. Meantime, Europe's regional Stoxx 600 share index dropped 0.9% to bottom at around 441 points. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Tuesday that the entire "global international security order" put in place after World War II is at stake if Russia gets away "cost-free" following its invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                , The top US general spoke exclusively to CNN at the conclusion of a meeting hosted by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin with allied countries at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Austin gathered the countries to discuss the current situation in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                           , "If this is left to stand, if there is no answer to this aggression, if Russia gets away with this cost-free, then so goes the so-called international order, and if that happens, then we're entering into an era of seriously increased instability," Milley said.                                                                                                                                                               , "What's at stake is the global international security order that was put in place in 1945. That international order has lasted 78 years, it's prevented great power war, and underlining that entire concept is the idea that large nations will not conduct military aggression against smaller nations, and that's exactly what's happened here, an unprovoked military aggression by Russia against a smaller nation," he added., Milley's warning about the potential global implications of Russia's actions in Ukraine also underscores the current sense of urgency felt by the US and its allies as the war enters what they say is a critical juncture.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , 'We don't have any time to waste'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Shortly after Milley's interview, Austin also stressed the importance of moving quickly to provide Ukraine with the military aid it needs, saying during a news conference that the US and other allies and partners "don't have any time to waste" when it comes to providing crucial assistance to counter Russia as their invasion continues.                                                                                   , "We don't have any time to waste. The briefings today laid out clearly why the coming weeks will be so crucial for Ukraine, so we've got to move at the speed of war.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures rose to above $100 per barrel in volatile trading on Tuesday, having fallen to as low as $97 earlier in the day and rebounding from a 5% loss in the past 2 sessions, as investors reassessed the impact of China’s worsening Covid situation on the outlook for global demand. China’s central bank on Tuesday pledged to increase support for the economy as authorities in Beijing expanded virus testing to most of the city, raising concerns about a lockdown of the capital. Meanwhile, analysts argued that the supply picture remains tight and bargain hunters appeared to be taking advantage of sharp falls in oil prices. The risk that the EU may decide to join the US and UK in banning Russian crude imports also loomed over the markets, as the war in Ukraine rages on. European buyers declined to purchase millions of barrels of Urals crude from Rosneft PJSC, while Asian oil refiners shunned Russia’s Sokol from the Far East due to sanctions on a tanker company that ships the cargoes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> EU Natural Gas Gains Momentum </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> EU natural gas futures gained momentum, approaching the €100 per megawatt-hour mark, as traders reacted to a spike in the UK benchmark natural gas contract. The discount in front-month futures in the UK to the Dutch contract, the benchmark in continental Europe, widened to its largest extent since at least 2011, due to elevated LNG arrivals and limited storage capacity in Britain. The UK has more excess regasification capacity than most European countries and exports most of this surplus to the continent. Meanwhile, forecasts pointing to cooler weather in the two weeks ahead and uncertain Russian supplies tilted the balance of risks to the upside. Still, gains were limited by recovering production levels in Europe’s 2nd largest supplier Norway and near-record high arrivals of US LNG cargoes, helped by weaker spot-market demand from Asian countries. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK Natural Gas Briefly Spikes on Rare Discount </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK natural gas prices bounced back briefly to the 170 pence a therm on Tuesday, rebounding sharply from a seven-month intraday low of 146.51 pence, as dip-buying more than offset ample natural gas supplies. The discount in front-month futures in the UK to the Dutch contract,  the benchmark in continental Europe, widened to its largest extent since at least 2011 earlier in the session, due to elevated LNG arrivals and limited storage capacity in Britain. The UK has more excess regasification capacity than most European countries and exports most of this surplus to the continent. Gains were later erased as downside risks from recovering output at Norwegian gas fields elevated LNG arrivals, as well as prospects of a weaker Chinese demand easing global spot prices for shipments of the ultra-cooled liquid gas. </td>

Energy company profits are surging. President Biden, who came into office promising to reduce the use of fossil fuels, has effectively joined the “drill, baby, drill” chorus. Europe would love to end its dependence on Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Yet most U.S. oil businesses are not eager to capitalize on this moment by pumping more oil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Production of oil by U.S. energy companies is essentially flat and unlikely to increase substantially for at least another year or two. If Europe stops buying Russian oil and natural gas as some of its leaders have promised, they won’t be able to replace that energy with fuels from the United States anytime soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , U.S. oil production is up less than 2 percent, to 11.8 million barrels a day, since December and remains well below the record 13.1 million barrels a day set in March 2020 just before the pandemic paralyzed the global economy. Government forecasters predict that American oil production will average just 12 million barrels a day in 2022, and increase by roughly another million in 2023. That would be well short of the nearly four million barrels of oil that Europe imports from Russia every day.                                       , “You had this bombastic, chest-pounding industry touting itself as the reincarnation of the American innovative spirit,” said Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University. “And now that they could be leaping into action to pitch in to bring much-needed oil to the world, they are being uncharacteristically cautious.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The biggest reason oil production isn’t increasing is that U.S. energy companies and Wall Street investors are not sure that prices will stay high long enough for them to make a profit from drilling lots of new wells. Many remember how abruptly and sharply oil prices crashed two years ago, forcing companies to lay off thousands of employees, shut down wells and even seek bankruptcy protection.                                                                                                                                            , Executives at 141 oil companies surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in mid-March offered several reasons that they weren’t pumping more oil. They said they were short of workers and sand, which is used to fracture shale fields to coax oil out of rock. But the most salient reason — the one offered by 60 percent of respondents — was that investors don’t want companies to produce a lot more oil, fearing that it will hasten the end of high oil prices.                                                                          , The Dallas Fed survey found that U.S. companies need oil prices to average just $56 a barrel to break even, a little more than half the current price. But some are worried that the price could fall to as little as $50 by the end of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “There is a tremendous amount of muscle memory from Covid and the dramatic drop in prices,” said Ben Shepperd, president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association in Midland, Texas. “If we were convinced oil prices would hold at levels of $75 a barrel or more for another three years, you would see a higher level of capital deployment.”                                                                                                                                                                                                      , U.S. oil companies are not alone. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have also refused to pump a lot more oil since Russia’s war in Ukraine began in late February.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , This deep-seated reluctance stands in contrast to how the oil industry has typically behaved when prices have surged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Over the last two decades, oil companies almost always responded to higher prices by investing and pumping more. A drilling frenzy accompanied the rise in prices in the early 2000s, and again in the recovery that followed the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. oil production has doubled since 2006, and the country has become a major exporter of oil, natural gas and petroleum products like gasoline and diesel.                                                                                                                                   , But every price boom was followed by a huge crash — three in just the last 14 years. Scores of companies have filed bankruptcy cases. Only two years ago, oil prices plummeted by more than $50 a barrel in a single day to less than zero as the pandemic took hold and producers had no place to store oil that nobody needed to buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Exxon Mobil’s stock fell so much that the keepers of the Dow Jones industrial average kicked it off the index. The company had been in the average in one form or another since 1928, and its departure became a symbol of Wall Street’s growing distaste for fossil fuel stocks as more investors demand that companies reduce the emissions causing climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                   , Oil executives and investors cite a number of outcomes under which prices could again fall quickly. For example, Russia could lose the war and have to retreat. Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in China could hobble that country’s economy, driving down global growth and demand for energy. A new nuclear deal with Iran could open a spigot of oil exports.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas producer that last year acquired two other oil companies, is no longer aiming to increase production 20 percent, as it had in years past. It now aims to grow just 5 percent. The company’s chief executive, Scott Sheffield, said he aimed to return 80 percent of its free cash flow — the cash left over after it pays its operating expenses and capital expenditures — to shareholders.                                                                                                                   , “The model has totally changed,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Oil executives also argue that they are spending a lot of money on new oil and gas production but that inflation is undercutting their efforts. Exploration and production spending will rise more than 20 percent this year, but about two-thirds of that increase will go toward paying higher prices for labor, materials and services, among other costs, according to RBN Energy, a research firm in Houston.                                                                                                                                      , “It is a bit of a sticker shock because we’re seeing inflation across the entire sector,” Jeff Miller, the chief executive of Halliburton, which drills wells and performs other services for oil companies, told analysts on a recent conference call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Smaller private companies, financed by private equity, are responsible for much of the new activity. According to the Dallas Fed survey, the median growth rate for companies that produce fewer than 10,000 barrels a day was projected at 15 percent this year, compared with only 6 percent for firms that produce more than 10,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Larger oil companies complain that even if they wanted to invest more, it would be hard because Wall Street isn’t keen on financing new fossil fuel projects. Some investors who are concerned about climate change are instead putting their money into renewable energy, electric cars and other businesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , It is not that investors have become environmentalists. Many have run the numbers and concluded that the recent jump in fossil fuel prices will be short-lived and that they are better off investing in companies and industries that they believe have a brighter future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “If you are an investor, has your view of the next five to 10 years actually changed? I think the answer is no,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, managing director at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University’s Fletcher School. “History tells us that oil shocks accelerate a shift to alternative energy, not the opposite.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Many oil executives also complain that the future of their industry is clouded by political and regulatory uncertainty. They acknowledge that Mr. Biden has been calling on them to produce more, but they fear that his administration will go back to emphasizing the need for less oil and gas when prices fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “During Earth Day, the president said we have got to get off oil, and at the same time he’s begging us for two million additional barrels to send to Europe,” said Kirk Edwards, chief executive of Latigo Petroleum, a West Texas producer. “You cannot have it both ways.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The tension between the strategic advantages of domestic oil and gas production and the environmental costs of fossil fuel use is not likely to go away soon. Environmentalists are worried that awarding more permits for oil drilling on public lands and building new terminals to export natural gas to Europe will increase the world’s dependence on fossil fuels. But administration officials have countered that their emphasis on increasing oil and gas production will not deter longer-term efforts to make a transition to cleaner energy., “We just can’t transition to green energy in a way that leaves us and our allies dependent on the oil of geopolitical rivals,” said Evan Ellis, a researcher at the U.S. Army War College and former State Department planner. “The ability of the U.S. to put more oil and gas into the market would be a useful weapon, enabling the Europeans to wean themselves off of Russian energy.”                                                                                                                                                             , David Braziel, chief executive of RBN Energy, said the United States had the capacity to export more than six million barrels of oil a day, roughly twice what it is exporting now. While ramping up production will take time, he said, the industry could produce 16 million barrels a day by 2027, four million barrels more than now, assuming prices remain high and investments increase.                                                                                                                                                         , “We have plenty of capacity to get extra crude oil out,” Mr. Braziel said. “We could be doing much more now than we are currently doing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Natural Gas Briefly Up 5% </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures briefly spiked past $7 per million British thermal units before limiting gains at $6.9, rebounding sharply from declines of the previous week, supported by reports of freeze-offs in pipelines in the Rocky Mountains. Pipeline operators had warned of supply disruptions ahead of a cold front last week, but actual issues began Sunday. At the same time, weather forecasts point to cooler-than-usual weather this week, which should keep demand above the 5-year average for longer. Still, gains were capped by a larger-than-expected injection in domestic inventories in the week ended April 15th. For the year, the contract is up roughly 80%, as harsh wintry weather extended well into spring, causing domestic inventories to shrink well below the five-year average. At the same time, the US is exporting LNG cargoes at record levels, mainly to Europe, as the region scrambles to replace Russian gas. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Collapsing trucker demand could foreshadow looming recession </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Slatestone Wealth Chief Market Strategist Kenny Polcari said on ‘Varney &amp; Co.’ the Federal Reserve interest rate hike could be 75 or 100 basis points in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A sharp, unexpected downturn in trucking demand since the beginning of March could be evidence of a looming economic recession, according to Bank of America strategists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , A Tuesday analyst note from Ken Hoexter, the managing director of Bank of America's trucking research, shows that shippers see rapidly softening demand for trucks, with a gauge tracking truckload demand falling for the fourth consecutive month to its lowest level since June 2020.                                                                                                                               , That is "near freight recession level," Hoexter wrote. On an annual basis, the gauge has plummeted about 23%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , ONE OF BIDEN'S FAVORITE ECONOMISTS SEES A HIGH CHANCE OF RECESSION IN NEXT 2 YEARS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Respondents noted a softening demand outlook, loosening market, deteriorating rail service, and pricing softness in the market," the analyst note said. "Shippers' short-term positive outlooks fell to 39% from 50% last survey, neutral outlooks jumped to 43% from 39%, while negative outlooks were 18% from 11%."                                                                                                , A different indicator that measures shippers' views on truck rates, meanwhile, collapsed to its lowest level since May 2020, when the U.S. economy was still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. About 36% of shippers now expect rates to fall in the coming months, a significant increase from the 17% recorded in the last issue.                                                                              , Shipping containers and chassis along a street in Long Beach, California, on Nov. 16, 2021.

Broader economic downturns have followed six of the 12 trucking recessions since 1972, according to one analysis conducted in 2019 by Convoy, a trucking data company.                                           , The analysis comes amid growing fears on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve could inadvertently trigger a recession as it takes a more aggressive approach to fighting inflation, which is at the highest level since December 1981. Policymakers raised rates by a quarter-percentage point in March, and have since confirmed that sharper, half-point increases are likely in the coming months, beginning in May., "It is appropriate to be moving a little more quickly," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week during a panel discussion at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings. "I also think there’s something in the idea of front end-loading whatever accommodation one thinks is appropriate. So that points in the direction of 50-basis points being on the table."                              , Traders are now pricing in a 100% chance of at least a half-point rate jump when policymakers meet on May 3-4. It would mark the first time since 2000 that the U.S. central bank raised the federal funds rate by 50 basis points.                                                                                                                                                                                    , A man wearing a mask walks past the U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington D.C., on April 29, 2020.

Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.                                                  , Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are among the Wall Street firms that have suggested a recession is possible – or likely – in the next two years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Powell has pushed back against concern that further tightening by the central bank will trigger a recession and has maintained optimism that the Fed can strike a delicate balance between taming inflation without crushing the economy.                                                                                                                                                                              , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Still, he acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead and said it is "absolutely essential" for central bankers to restore price stability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Our goal is to use our tools to get demand and supply back in sync, so inflation moves back into place, without a slowdown that amounts to a recession," Powell said. "I don't think you'll hear anyone at the Fed say that's straightforward and easy. It's going to be challenging." </td>

whole day seems suppressed now 
 
macroeconomics dictates the relationship between the  
bitcoin and the dollar. 
 
a high close to the previous ones is a strong indicator of previous events like BTC taking off 
 
We are over 100 and steadily approaching it r n 
 
given the reversal in $SPY and $QQQ there is a greater than average likelihood (over 50%)...that $BTC.X will moon from ...🫢 aha! 
 
 this dip in momentum today 
 
it&amp;#39;s appearing in some tokens already. LFG 🔌💰

Peak Vix was in January. The Vix has been putting in lower highs throughout this tumultuous period. Today could be the top of the vix, and bottom of the downtrend, in which case we get a huge rally ahead. 
 
When the vix topped out around 36 in March, $SPY was around $415, where it is today. As the vix returned to its base (green line) through end of March $SPY rallied up to $460. 
 
Maybe the vix breaks higher and the market breaks down. OR, maybe the vix rolls over here and keeps the downtrend, we double bottom and head back up. I&amp;#39;m still betting on that. 
 
In any case it&amp;#39;s generally been a good idea to be long the market when the vix is this high. </td>

Pretty salt. Atleast in 30 minutes I won’t be anyone sucker anymore because

My thoughts on the mkt today .... 

As I told members today ahead of earnings this morning,  MSFT was more likely to put up the stronger earnings report (SEE BELOW) between it and Google  - and they did just that! But even with MSFT&amp;#39;s strong qtr, what does that mean for the other three &amp;quot;Generals&amp;quot; that report this week? 

This mkt has been ugly, but there are gems being created. I&amp;#39;ve been big on energy and fertilizer names for months  - those have been gems. We will get a rotation back into tech  -  it will come. And there are a basket of gems there as well. Most importantly, this mkt takes patience. A virtue few traders have.  Stocks in this mkt aren&amp;#39;t getting away  - so I don&amp;#39;t need to try and catch a knife. Patience. 

Keep those seatbelts fastened. It doesn&amp;#39;t get any less bumpy in the final days of the week. ✌️ </td>

I would have $20k a year just in trading fees, now you have  so much more lvg, you can build a position over days &amp;amp; not tack that  onto your Avg. 
 
Retail can use that in amazing ways but maybe younger Traders dont have anything to compare it to so its relative I guess but it made trading Markets like this much harder. 
 
But this is where you make your medal, when things get tough.

What is even worse is having Harris as the Vice President.

Harris is even worse at that. The four year plan to destroy the middle class and place all the power in the elites hands is working as they expected. Americans have been placed in a situation where we have to choose between dumb and even dumber! Hopefully more people will wake up! Best wishes! ✌🏻 </td>

Earnings are pure manipulation and day traders will come in to make money quickly.

&amp;quot;matches the law&amp;quot; ... LMFAO. 
 
2020 pres election conspiracies -- nope. 
anti-vax conspiracies -- nope. 
Easy to continue. 
But let&amp;#39;s up the ante.   
 
&amp;quot;China Flu&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Wuhan lab&amp;quot; conspiracies? 
Those don&amp;#39;t violate the law. 
But China won&amp;#39;t be pleased. 
Tesla wants to be big dog in China. 
Xi doesn&amp;#39;t care for uber-capitalists. 
Ask Jack Ma. 
China asks Musk to control misinformation. 
What happens? 
 
Same thing will occur with US politicians. 
Lots of politicians hate green energy. 
Or are in the back pockets of big industry. 
Musk doesn&amp;#39;t -- and isn&amp;#39;t.   
 
This is the stupidest acquisition of the year.

My thoughts on the mkt today .... 

As I told members today ahead of earnings this morning,  MSFT was more likely to put up the stronger earnings report (SEE BELOW) between it and Google  - and they did just that! But even with MSFT&amp;#39;s strong qtr, what does that mean for the other three &amp;quot;Generals&amp;quot; that report this week? 

This mkt has been ugly, but there are gems being created. I&amp;#39;ve been big on energy and fertilizer names for months  - those have been gems. We will get a rotation back into tech  -  it will come. And there are a basket of gems there as well. Most importantly, this mkt takes patience. A virtue few traders have.  Stocks in this mkt aren&amp;#39;t getting away  - so I don&amp;#39;t need to try and catch a knife. Patience. 

Keep those seatbelts fastened. It doesn&amp;#39;t get any less bumpy in the final days of the week. ✌️ </td>

I would have $20k a year just in trading fees, now you have  so much more lvg, you can build a position over days &amp;amp; not tack that  onto your Avg. 
 
Retail can use that in amazing ways but maybe younger Traders dont have anything to compare it to so its relative I guess but it made trading Markets like this much harder. 
 
But this is where you make your medal, when things get tough.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TWTR … $TSLA  … this margin call FUD on Elon musk is really quite silly.  Way to ignore the 60-80 billion of non tesla wealth that he has amassed.   GL with that. He will close on Twitter at $54.20 which trades at a 9-10% discount right now. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA considering Twitter is trading in 49-s market kinda doesn&amp;#39;t really trust that deal is going to happen OR maybe market believes, that the actual merger is still many months away

Otherwise I don&amp;#39;t understand how something with a price tag 54.4 can be traded at 49 $TSLa </td>

But was not perfect today tried to buy calls on $TSLA twice for bounces and both failed.  Didn’t get any meaningful bounce thanks Cathie Wood for panic selling. 

Still a Green Day is a good day.  Aiming for a 30 day winning streak since my last one snapped at 20.  One important lesson..never will I ever trade from my phone on vacation a day. </td>

Elon made his offer for Twitter 1 month to early.  Elon has till October (I believe) to get out of the deal and pay a $1B exit fee. If the market keeps declining Elon should try to  renigotiate the deal at a much lower price (*there were no other offers*) and if Twitter will not lower the price Elon should pay the $1B exit fee and walk way. Elon can always make another offer if Twitters price goes lower (again there were no other offers).  *Tsla went down 13% today which is more then $1B. </td>
