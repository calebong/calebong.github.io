"Even more importantly, the legislation may support the growth of new tech businesses adjacent to the platforms, which may ultimately pose a critically needed competitive check to the covered platforms themselves.", The bills supplement existing antitrust laws by clarifying what kinds of conduct Congress views as anti-competitive and illegal, the letter adds, noting that "doing so would enhance the ability of the DOJ and [the Federal Trade Commission] to challenge that conduct."                                                                                                                                     , An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015.

Some conservatives are wary of expanding the government’s power to police digital markets, while some Democrats, particularly from California, say the legislation unfairly targets a handful of large companies.                                        , At the January committee vote, a number of senators who voted "yes" said they still wanted to see changes to the bill before supporting it on the Senate floor. The legislation’s backers, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), are in talks with their colleagues to craft a version of the bill that can pass. </td>

Locally, Hong Kong's finance chief Paul Chan expressed confidence in the city's ability to recover after predicting the economy to contract in Q1, amid COVID-19 outbreak and a slowdown in exports. Gains were mainly driven by healthcare stocks, technology, and consumer non-cyclicals. Property shares went against the wider trend, however, with Sunac sinking almost 20% after saying  it would halt trading from April 1st, days after it said it would delay reporting its 2021 financial results and joining a growing list of Chinese developers who are not able to release earnings on time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OttawaCanada has picked Lockheed Martin Corp as the preferred bidder to supply 88 new fighter jets, Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi said Monday, in a clear sign the US company is set to win the multibillion-dollar contract.                                                                            , The move indicates Canada -- under pressure to boost defense spending as the war in Ukraine rages -- is closer to making a decision that has dragged out for more than a decade.                                                                                                                               , "This announcement marks another important milestone in Canada's competitive process to purchase modern fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force," Tassi said.                                                                                                                                            , Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for more than a decade to replace its aging F-18 fighters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 that it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.                                                   , "The F-35 is in operational use by NORAD and NATO partners in missions around the globe. It has proven to be a mature, capable and interoperable aircraft and that is why we are moving to the finalization phase of this procurement," Defense Minister Anita Anand, speaking alongside Tassi, told reporters., The federal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will now only hold detailed talks with Lockheed Martin. Ottawa says it hopes to award the contract this year and take first deliveries in 2025.                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Defense sources had long bet on the US company, given Canada belongs to the consortium that developed its F-35 jet and the fact the plane is the military's first choice. Ottawa says the contract could be worth up to $19 billion Canadian dollars (about $15 billion).                                      , "We look forward to continuing our partnership with Canadian industry to deliver and sustain the F-35 for the Royal Canadian Air Force," Lockheed Martin Canada chief executive Lorraine Ben said in a statement.                                                                                              , If the negotiations for some reason fail, the government will turn to Sweden's Saab, the other contender.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "While we maintain our position that Saab presented the best offer for the Future Fighter Capability Project, we respect the decision of the government of Canada," the Swedish company said in a statement, adding that it would continue to collaborate with Canada in current and future programs.          , Canada though has a long history of using US military equipment and, unlike Sweden, belongs to both NATO and NORAD, the North American defense organization.                                                                                                                                                   , Trudeau came to power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 as too expensive but has shifted his position.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The obvious alternative would have been Boeing but it fell out of favor after taking trade action against Canadian rival Bombardier and was excluded from the competition last December.                                                                                                                       , </td>

Though Western sanctions have frozen a chunk of the country’s foreign exchange reserves following its invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s regime has about $140 billion of the yellow metal that is beyond the direct reach of sanctions . Using it can require complicated and risky schemes. But that also makes it difficult to track.                                    , Putin has been shoring up his defenses against economic restrictions for years. Russia’s gold holdings have tripled since it annexed Crimea in 2014, triggering U.S. sanctions. A senior White House official last week estimated bullion makes up about 20% of the country’s central bank’s overall reserves.                                                                                                                                 , Gold futures fell for a second straight session as the U.S. dollar strengthened and investors eyed developments in the Russia-Ukraine war.

That’s why the United States and its allies last week moved to close that loophole. The Treasury Department said any transactions involving gold held by the Russian central bank are subject to existing sanctions, which means anyone who helps convert the precious metal into U.S. dollars could face penalties.                            , GOLD APPEAL LESSENED AS WAR IN UKRAINE DRAGS ON                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Despite those risks, some supportive or opportunistic countries may be Owilling to help Putin. Venezuela, for example, may have relied on Russia after the United States stepped up sanctions on the South American country in 2017.

In 2020, the U.S. State Department said it was following a visit to Venezuela by the private jet of Libyan militia leader Khalifa Haftar, who was suspected of trading gold for dollars.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The usually complex schemes can take years to prosecute. U.S. courts are still examining some aspects of an alleged plot that started in 2010 and involved several Turkish entities that helped Iran evade sanctions, including turning gold into cash. The plan involved money servicers, front companies, fake humanitarian food shipments and businesses located in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Hong Kong.                          , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The Russian rouble has fallen by more than 20% against the dollar this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , - Reuters contributed to this report. </td>

Higher oil prices have been good for oil-producing economies. Despite efforts at diversification, Gulf Arab states continue to rely heavily on energy exports to fuel their economies., - The Associated Press contributed to this report.  </td>

The city’s director of transportation would then need to authorize it, paving the way for Uber and Flywheel, which operates an app used by hundreds of taxi drivers in San Francisco across several taxi companies to accept rides.                                                                                                                                                                                       , The agreement, after a similar partnership between Uber and taxi companies in New York City was announced last week, would mark an abrupt departure from the years of fierce fighting between the two groups. If approved by regulators, the partnership in San Francisco could begin as soon as May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Uber has called the taxi industry corrupt and greedy, and a San Francisco taxi company once sued Uber in federal court, accusing it of predatory pricing practices. Some taxi drivers are pushing back against the idea of a partnership, worried that it would lead to lower earnings and make it more difficult for longtime taxi customers to get affordable rides.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The agreement is particularly surprising because San Francisco, Uber’s hometown, has been among a group of cities that have at times aggressively resisted Uber’s business. Uber, along with other companies that use gig workers, like Lyft and DoorDash, backed California’s Proposition 22, a measure that gave gig workers some limited benefits but prohibited them from being considered full employees. Though the measure passed statewide in 2020, before a judge threw it out last year, San Francisco was one of the few counties where a majority of voters opposed it., In recent years, Uber has struck partnerships with taxi firms, mostly outside the United States. The company said in February that it had added 122,000 taxis to its platform last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The taxi industry had lost customers to ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft even before the pandemic drastically reduced travel demand. The number of taxis in operation fell to 400 during the pandemic — from 1,300 — before recovering to 600, the Municipal Transportation Agency said. Teaming up with Uber could give taxi drivers access to a much larger pool of riders, while Uber would gain supply in the form of hundreds of taxi drivers.                                                                                                                        , Last year, San Francisco approved a test program that would allow passengers who ordered a taxi using an app to receive a guaranteed upfront cost, similar to how Uber and Lyft function. The goal was to help taxi drivers earn more money, in part by countering a phenomenon called meter anxiety — the idea that the unease of watching a ride’s cost increase in real time on a taxi meter prompts riders to cancel a trip or avoid calling a taxi in the first place. The upfront cost was required to be the same as the trip’s cost if calculated using a meter.           , Now Uber wants to join this experiment, with a twist: If San Francisco approves so-called “third-party dispatch services” like Uber to participate, the upfront cost that Uber charges customers to get a taxi through its app will not be required to be the same as a metered taxi ride. That means they could charge the same price as a typical UberX car ride, which is often cheaper than a taxi ride.                                                                                                                                                                       , That has some San Francisco taxi drivers concerned that they will be offered cheap rides that earn them only a few dollars. Others worry that surge pricing — when Uber elevates rates at times of high demand — could price current low-income taxi customers out of getting rides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “It’s just not right,” said Evelyn Engel, an executive board member at the San Francisco Taxi Workers Alliance, which backs taxi drivers.

"We don't look for a recession because of that yield curve that's driving the lending is still very positive.", Dwyer acknowledges the overall bond market is reflecting economic challenges — but not enough to spark a recession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "The fear is definitely there. Asia seems to be a mess with more lockdowns. Europe is heading toward a recession, if not in one because of the once in a generation ground war there," he said. "The U.S. is being affected by higher rates. So, it certainly is slowing down."                                                               , Dwyer expects the Federal Reserve to continue raising rates over the next few months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "There's no question inflation is high.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Amazon union election: Will this former worker make history? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> When former Amazon worker Chris Smalls organised a small protest outside a massive Amazon warehouse in New York two years ago, he didn't intend to pick a years-long fight with one of the world's largest companies. He just wanted his team to be able to do their jobs safely.                       , "When the pandemic came, employees underneath me were getting sick," he says. "I realised that something was wrong."                                                                                                                                                                                    , Amazon fired him, citing quarantine violations. But his concerns caught the world's attention - an early sign of a much bigger labour battle brewing at the e-commerce giant.                                                                                                                           , In the following months, as its business surged thanks to the pandemic, Amazon faced accusations around the world that it neglected staff welfare - claims it denied.                                                                                                                                   , In the US, the company now faces its most serious labour unrest in decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , After walkouts and protests across the country, workers at three warehouses in New York and Alabama are deciding whether to join a labour union - which would be a first for Amazon in the US.                                                                                                          , Mr Smalls is one of the leaders in the fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , He says he's embracing a role the shopping giant set out in a leaked memo from 2020, which described Mr Smalls as "not smart or articulate" and argued that if he became "the face of the entire union/organising movement" it would help to undermine it.                                              , Mr Smalls, who worked at Amazon for more than four years, starting as an entry-level worker before getting promoted, said he was blindsided by the memo, which some saw as racist, though Amazon told reporters at the time the author wasn't aware Mr Smalls was black.                                , "My whole life changed in one minute," the father-of-two says. "From there, I started to pretty much try to make them eat their words."                                                                                                                                                                 , For 11 months, the 33-year-old and his team have staked out a spot opposite his former workplace, the JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island, intercepting staff on their way home to make the case that they need a union to fight for them in negotiations with the e-commerce giant.                        , His team are seeking higher pay, longer breaks, more paid time off and paid medical leave, among other changes. They want to convince workers that a union will be a more effective way to raise complaints over rules like one that requires staff to work unscheduled overtime shifts.                , Voting on the question began 25 March and the result will be announced in coming days. Amazon faces a second election at a smaller warehouse in the same industrial park next month.                                                                                                                    , Organisers say the stakes are nothing short of the future of the American worker, pointing to Amazon's rank as the second largest employer in the US.                                                                                                                                                   , "We need to take down Amazon. We need these workers to organise," says Derrick Palmer, who helped Mr Smalls organise his 2020 protest and was also disciplined (but not fired) by Amazon, which cited social distancing violations. "We need them to know they have the power."                         , Amazon saw off a similar unionisation effort in Alabama last year, convincing workers to vote 2-1 against the idea.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The vote - the first the company had faced in the US since it was founded in 1994 - looked decisive. But regulators later called for a re-run, saying Amazon had violated rules that protect the right to organise during the campaign.                                                                 , Officials started counting the results of that vote on 28 March.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , John Logan, professor of labour and employment studies at San Francisco State University, says it's remarkable that activists have even got to the point of an election, given how much American laws favour employers.                                                                                 , Last year, union membership in the US sank again, continuing a decades-long decline despite a surge of activism leading to successful campaigns at Starbucks, media outlets and some smaller retailers.                                                                                                 , "Something has definitely changed in the last two years, when it comes to the labour landscape in the United States, and... the Amazon union votes are a reflection of that change," Prof Logan says.                                                                                                   , "It would be a monumental event if either of the unions [in New York] were to win. But even if they were to lose, if the results are close I still think it will result in more union activity at Amazon warehouses across the country."                                                                , Last year, in the aftermath of the Alabama election, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos pledged that the company would do better by its workers, including addressing the firm's high injury rate.                                                                                                               , "Despite what we've accomplished, it's clear to me that we need a better vision for our employees' success," he wrote in his final letter to shareholders before stepping down as chief executive.                                                                                                      , Amazon - which US regulators have accused of retaliating illegally against labour organisers on their staff - remains staunchly anti-union.                                                                                                                                                             , The firm says it offers competitive pay and benefits and a union will only add a new layer of bureaucracy, while membership fees eat into workers' wages.                                                                                                                                               , To fight the campaigns, the firm has inundated staff with texts, fliers and other materials and held repeated mandatory training meetings about the issue, where they cast doubt on the union's ability to secure improvements for its members.                                                         , "Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union," says spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. "As a company we don't think unions are the best answer for our employees. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work."                      , Amazon has been urging workers to vote, warning that if the election is dominated by pro-union forces and the union emerges victorious, it will represent everyone at the warehouses in question.                                                                                                       , "Negotiations are always a give and take," an Amazon representative warns in audio of a meeting in New York supplied by organisers. "What's important to the [Amazon Labor Union] may not be important to you. They will be willing to trade your priorities for one of theirs."                        , A union victory in New York is far from assured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Leroy Hairston, 22, who has worked at the JFK8 warehouse in New York for about two months - not unusual at a place with high turnover - tells the BBC he is leaning against the union. He thinks it is inexperienced and would struggle to make changes, making resolving staff issues more complicated,, "I don't see the point," he says. "Everything is prolonged instead of just going to HR."                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mr Smalls says he is hopeful that New York - where one in five workers belong to a union - offers better conditions for victory than Alabama, a notoriously anti-union state.                                                                                                                           , He also has contacts in more than a dozen other warehouses around the country that he hopes to unionise should he prove victorious.                                                                                                                                                                     , "Once we get established here, we want to spread like wildfire," Mr Smalls says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Over the last month, Amazon Labor Union volunteers have made a concerted final push to convince undecided workers.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Julian Mitchell-Israel, a 22-year-old community activist who took a job with Amazon to join the union effort, estimates their odds of winning at just over 50%.                                                                                                                                         , At a blustery cold rally in the Staten Island industrial park this month, Mr Smalls, in a red hoodie and trainers, seemed undaunted. Surrounded by workers, union activists and politicians he led the small crowd in a chant of: "We will win! We will win!"                                           , Mickie Garson, 50, who has worked at Amazon for three years and drove in on her day off to hear the union make its pitch, surveyed the scene from the Amazon parking lot, divided from the speakers by several lanes of traffic.                                                                        , She said she remained "on the fence" despite experience at previous jobs that made her confident a unionised workplace would be better.                                                                                                                                                                 , "It's the pressure of knowing that we could make history," she says. "We're excited with the fact that it could happen but also, then what happens after that?"                                                                                                                                         , The ‘enemy of the state’ who won historic Olympic gold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Martin Lewis is here to help with energy bills                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Which ones should make a comeback?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , © 2022 BBC.

The paper, which explained how companies could deliver items faster if they changed their shipping strategies, was given a C grade because Mr. Smith’s professor didn’t think the strategy was viable, according to Entrepreneur magazine.              , In its first 26 months of business, the company lost $29 million. Mr. Smith has recounted how he was able to keep the company afloat with money he won by gambling in Las Vegas. In one story told in a memoir by a former FedEx executive, Robert Frock, Mr. Smith took the company’s last $5,000 to Vegas and brought back winnings of $27,000 — money that allowed FedEx to pay a fuel bill and keep the company afloat.                             , During his decades leading the company, Mr. Smith expanded FedEx into a billion-dollar business that revolutionized the air transport business. According to FedEx, the company operated 695 aircraft across 220 countries in 2022 and moves about 17 million packages per day. For the three months that ended in February, it reported profit of more than $1 billion on $23.6 billion of revenue.                                                    , Mr. Smith was an early advocate of the 2017 tax cuts advanced by President Donald J. Trump. The tax cuts allowed FedEx to avoid more than $1.5 billion in taxes, according to a November 2019 article in The New York Times. After the publication of the article, Mr. Smith challenged the publisher and the business editor of The Times to a debate. The debate did not occur, and Mr. Smith did not point to factual errors in The Times’s coverage., Advertisement </td>

We are awaiting confirmation of all the detainable items."                                                                                                     , P&amp;O Ferries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Another P&amp;O Ferries vessel, the European Causeway, failed an MCA Port State Control inspection last week.                                                                                                                                                            , The ferry was detained in Larne over "failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training".                                                                                                                                                     , Port State Control is the inspection of foreign ships in national ports, to check that the condition of the ship and its equipment comply with the requirements of international rules - including emergency procedures such as firefighting and evacuating the ship., The RMT union said: "It's rare enough for the MCA to impound a ferry but P&amp;O have now had two in a week after the jobs carve-up which speaks volumes about the dire state of their operation".                                                                       , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted that "safety would not be compromised".                                                                                                                                                                                     , P&amp;O Ferries prompted outrage on 17 March when it announced that it would be replacing staff immediately with agency workers paid less than the UK minimum wage.                                                                                                      , At the weekend, unions carried out protests at ports in Dover, Hull and Liverpool.                                                                                                                                                                                   , On Monday, Mr Shapps said the company's boss had been given "one final opportunity" to re-employ sacked staff on their previous salaries.                                                                                                                            , In a letter to Peter Hebblethwaite, he again urged him to reverse his decision to sack 800 seafarers.                                                                                                                                                                , If not, he said the government's plans to make it illegal for ferry firms to pay less than the minimum wage, would be likely to force him to do so.                                                                                                                  , P&amp;O Ferries initially informed the government its services would be suspended for approximately 7-10 days.                                                                                                                                                           , Eleven days on from the shock sackings announcement, most of the company's ferries are still going nowhere.                                                                                                                                                          , The business said at the time it would lose £1m for every day services were not running.                                                                                                                                                                             , After the European Causeway was detained, P&amp;O Ferries said it would make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service.                                                                                               , But the failure of two vessels to pass safety inspections must surely cast some doubt on the prospect of currently suspended routes resuming quickly, under their new crewing arrangements.                                                                          , Other ferry operators were ramping up services in anticipation of growing passenger demand for Easter and summer travel, now Covid restrictions have eased.                                                                                                          , They're taking a lot more bookings than normal, and increasing capacity where possible to try to keep traffic flowing.                                                                                                                                               , P&amp;O Ferries said sacking workers was not just about saving money on wages.                                                                                                                                                                                           , "The predicted savings we announced are not solely coming from the reduction in wages, but from removing job duplication and the benefits we will see from increased flexibility," it said.                                                                          , It said it would welcome the minimum wage rising for all seafaring workers because it would create "a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes".                                                                              , Ministers plan to force all ferry companies operating from UK ports to pay at least the national minimum wage, in an attempt to persuade P&amp;O Ferries to reinstate the workers it has sacked.                                                                         , The UK minimum wage is £8.91 per hour for workers over 23. The average rate paid to the agency staff brought in by P&amp;O Ferries would be £5.50, which is in line with international maritime standards.                                                               , Efforts to change the law will begin on Wednesday or Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The ‘enemy of the state’ who won historic Olympic gold                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Martin Lewis is here to help with energy bills                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Which ones should make a comeback?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , © 2022 BBC.

Crucially, it changes rules on calculating income to include gains from stocks, even if they were not sold by the investor being taxed.                                                                   , "This approach means that the very wealthiest Americans pay taxes as they go, just like everyone else, and eliminates the inefficient sheltering of income for decades or generations," the White House said.                                                                                 , The idea is the latest in a long list of efforts to raise taxes on the super-rich and faces long odds in Washington - not to mention opposition among the class it proposes to target.                                                                                                        , There are about 20,600 people worth more than $100m in the US, according to estimates by the Boston Consulting Group.                                                                                                                                                                         , The White House said more than half the $360bn raised from the measure over 10 years would come from the country's roughly 700 billionaires.                                                                                                                                                  , "Eventually they run out of other people's money and then they come for you," Tesla boss and world's richest man Elon Musk wrote on Twitter last year about a similar proposal.                                                                                                               , Under Mr Biden's proposal, Mr Musk - a father of seven who boasts a net worth of more than $280bn - would have to pay $50bn more in taxes over 10 years than under the current system, according to analysis by Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley.        , Amazon founder Jeff Bezos would face an extra $35bn bill, while Warren Buffett would be on the hook for $26bn.                                                                                                                                                                                , "This is big," Prof Zucman, who has studied billionaire wealth and helped design a wealth tax proposal for left-wing Senator Elizabeth Warren, wrote on Twitter.                                                                                                                              , Mr Biden's budget also calls for raising the income tax rate on households earning over $400,000 from 37% to 39.6% and increasing the tax on companies to 28%, partially reversing cuts made under the Trump administration.                                                                  , He would also make other reforms to the system for taxing the gains in value from stocks and property, which would apply beyond the richest Americans.                                                                                                                                        , Together the reforms and others in the budget would help reduce the deficit by $1tn over the next decade, according to the White House.                                                                                                                                                       , For the 2022 financial year, the annual deficit is projected at more than $1.2tn.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning at peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border earlier this month, sources close to him say.                                                                                                                                  , The Chelsea FC owner - who has now recovered - reportedly suffered sore eyes and peeling skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Two Ukrainian peace negotiators were also said to have been affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , One report said the alleged poisoning was orchestrated by Russian hardliners who wanted to sabotage the talks.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Shortly after the allegations emerged, an unnamed US official was quoted by Reuters as saying that intelligence suggested the men's symptoms were due to "environmental" factors, not poisoning.                                                                                                          , And later an official in the Ukrainian president's office, Ihor Zhovkva, told the BBC that while he hadn't spoken to Mr Abramovich, members of the Ukrainian delegation were "fine" and one had said the story was "false".                                                                               , However, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says it would hardly be surprising that the US would want to dampen down suggestions that anyone - especially Russia - had used a chemical weapon in Ukraine, as this could push them into retaliatory action that they are extremely reluctant to take., The conditions of Mr Abramovich and the Ukrainian negotiators, who include Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, have improved since the incident on 3 March, the Wall Street Journal quoted sources as saying.                                                                                                     , A source close to Mr Abramovich told the BBC he had now recovered and was continuing with negotiations to try and end the war in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                 , The incident casts light on Mr Abramovich's reported role as a broker in talks between Ukraine and Russia. The exact nature of his position is unclear, but a spokesperson for the oligarch previously said his influence was "limited".                                                                  , On Sunday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Mr Abramovich had offered him help to de-escalate Russia's invasion of the country.                                                                                                                                                                , The Russian billionaire travelled between Moscow and Kyiv for several rounds of talks at the start of the month. He reportedly met Mr Zelensky during the trip, but the Ukrainian leader was not affected and his spokesman had no information about the incident.                                        , The investigative journalism group Bellingcat, meanwhile, said Mr Abramovich and the negotiators suffered symptoms "consistent with poisoning with chemical weapons".                                                                                                                                     , The symptoms included "eye and skin inflammation and piercing pain in the eyes", Bellingcat reported.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr Abramovich has since been seen in public, being pictured at Israel's Tel Aviv airport on 14 March.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr Abramovich was sanctioned by the EU and UK earlier this month over his alleged links to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, which he denies.                                                                                                                                                            , But Mr Zelensky has reportedly asked the US to hold off from sanctioning Mr Abramovich, arguing he could play a role in negotiating a peace deal with Moscow.                                                                                                                                             , The Kremlin has said Mr Abramovich played an early role in peace talks but the process was now in the hands of the two countries' negotiating teams.                                                                                                                                                      , The two sides are set to meet in Istanbul on Tuesday for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                     , On the afternoon of 3 March, Roman Abramovich joined Russian and Ukrainian peace negotiators at talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border. What happened next is very mysterious.                                                                                                                               , Later that night, three of the delegates - including Mr Abramovich - according to the investigative website Bellingcat, suffered symptoms of nerve agent poisoning.                                                                                                                                       , They had inflamed skin, irritated eyes and severe pain behind the eyes - symptoms which lasted all night.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , None of them had eaten anything more, according to Bellingcat, than chocolate and water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Chemical weapons specialists have examined this case and concluded that they believe it was an intentional use of a chemical agent.                                                                                                                                                                       , But we have no idea who did it. There is no claim of responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Inevitably people will be wondering if this was the work of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service, who Britain concluded was behind the Novichok Salisbury poisoning in 2018.                                                                                                                   , There has been no immediate comment from Russia and no proof they were responsible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But somebody, it seems, wanted to send a warning to those taking part in the peace talks. This was not a lethal dose, it was a warning.                                                                                                                                                                   , The suggestion made by an unnamed US official that environmental factors were to blame is odd.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Nobody else was affected by these very serious medical afflictions. The chemical weapons expert, Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, told the BBC it was highly improbable that environmental factors had anything to do with it.                                                                                   , The ‘enemy of the state’ who won historic Olympic gold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Martin Lewis is here to help with energy bills                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Which ones should make a comeback?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , © 2022 BBC.

On the domestic front, the Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnight rate by 25bps to 0.5% this month, the first hike since October 2018, reiterating it will use its monetary policy tools to return inflation to the 2% target.

The ruble tumbled to as low as 150 per dollar earlier in March after a raft of sanctions were announced by major economies to punish and isolate Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks wobbled on Monday after two consecutive weeks of gains, with the Dow falling more than 150 points, the S&amp;P 500 around the flatline and the Nasdaq rising more than 0.5%. Investors are monitoring volatility in the government bond market and the possibility of the so-called yield inversion, fueling concerns that rising inflation and higher interest rates will drag the nation’s economy into a recession. Banks and energy stocks slid alongside the oil prices. Tesla jumped more than 7% after the company said it would seek investor approval for a stock split. Meanwhile, Apple was trading slightly lower after a report showed that the company planned to cut iPhone and AirPod output as rising inflation dented pent-up demand. On a positive note, peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are set to resume tomorrow in Turkey with President Zelenskyy pledging Ukraine could adopt a neutral status as part of a deal with Russia. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biden administration proposes larger defense budget to counter China, Russia - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)President Joe Biden's proposed fiscal year 2023 Pentagon budget includes $813 billion in spending for national defense, a 4% increase of $31 billion from the spending package signed into law earlier this month.                                                                                                                             , The Biden administration's defense budget remains focused on China as the primary strategic challenge, with an emphasis on strengthening European security in light of the threat posed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                             , "If you look across the board at their capability, their economy, China remains our most challenging strategic threat. That's what the strategy says, that's what the budget says," a senior defense official told reporters ahead of the budget release.                                                                                            , The Biden administration's proposal includes $773 billion in funding specifically for the Pentagon in the coming year. Congress, which will ultimately set spending levels for the federal government, is likely to boost that figure higher, just as it did in the fiscal year 2022 spending package.                                               , Republicans quickly responded to the Pentagon's budget rollout by arguing it wasn't enough for the US military in the face of Russia's attack on Ukraine and China's military investments. Liberal Democrats, however, criticized the Biden administration for ramping up the defense budget at all.                                                 , While the 2023 budget proposal was crafted before Russia invaded Ukraine last month, the Biden administration's defense budget recognizes the "acute threat" posed by Russia, Defense Department budget documents say. Russia "is pursuing a political, economic and military strategy that seeks to fracture NATO," the Pentagon said.              , The defense budget includes $6.9 billion in funding for a European Deterrence Initiative intended to counter Russian aggression and support Ukraine -- funding that the White House touted in a fact sheet rolling out the entire federal budget proposal on Monday.                                                                                 , In the fiscal year 2022 spending bill approved last month, Congress passed a $13.6 billion supplemental funding bill to provide security assistance to Ukraine and help resupply the Ukrainians with weapons.                                                                                                                                        , It's virtually impossible to estimate how long the war between Russia and Ukraine will last, making it incredibly difficult to know whether the US will provide more in security assistance to Kyiv. The US has added thousands of troops to eastern Europe on temporary deployments to bolster NATO's eastern flank.                                , "The hard question is whether this is going to last for a short time or a long time," the official said. "I would certainly say that it is possible that there will be a supplemental for Ukraine."                                                                                                                                                  , Additional security assistance bills for Ukraine would also require congressional action. Pentagon comptroller Michael McCord suggested to reporters Monday that an additional supplemental for Ukraine was likely later this year.                                                                                                                  , Modernizing the military                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The US Army's overall troop levels are poised to drop by 3,000. The US Navy proposes decommissioning 24 ships, including nine littoral combat ships and five cruisers. The embattled littoral combat ships have faced perennial problems, including repeated breakdowns and questions about their limited armament.                                  , The ships were hailed as part of the US deterrent against China, since they were designed to operate in shallow waters like the South China Sea. But the decomissioning of so many in one year appears to be an acknowledgment that the expensive surface combatants have failed to live up to expectations.                                         , And in the air, the Pentagon only plans to purchase 61 F-35 aircraft, compared to the 85 purchased last year. The Air Force is also proposing the retirement of A-10 attack planes and F-22 fighters.                                                                                                                                                , All of those plans are likely face pushback from Congress, which has repeatedly resisted cutbacks that would hurt weapons suppliers based in their districts or bases and shipyards that could shrink if planes and ships are removed.                                                                                                               , The defense official said that the proposed increased budget wasn't intended to increase the size of the US military, but rather to help modernize it to compete with Russia and China.                                                                                                                                                              , Many of the department's programs, even if they don't specifically apply to Russia or China, address the challenges posed by both countries, the official noted. That includes investments like space, cyber and the industrial base.                                                                                                                , "The growth in the top line is not about making the force bigger," the official said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)President Joe Biden reiterated on Monday that he was not announcing a change in US policy when he had said that Russian President Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power" -- a remark that caught American and international officials off-guard, sending the White House into clean-up mode over the weekend.                                                                                                                                                                                    , "I just was expressing my outrage. He shouldn't remain in power, just like, you know, bad people shouldn't continue to do bad things," Biden said in response to a question from CNN's Kaitlan Collins at the White House. "But it doesn't mean we have a fundamental policy to do anything to take Putin down in any way."                                                                                                                                                                             , Two days after Biden's return from Europe, the improvised comment made at the end of an address in Warsaw about Putin -- "For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power" -- has hovered over the White House.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The White House and Biden have repeatedly tried to downplay the remark. The administration and allies say Biden wasn't calling for regime change to remove Putin from power. Rather, they argue that Biden was saying Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over neighboring nations.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "I was talking to the Russian people," Biden said on Monday at the White House when asked by Collins why he ad-libbed the line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "The last part of the speech was talking to Russian people," he said. "I was communicating this to, not only the Russian people but the whole world. This is ... just stating a simple fact that this kind of behavior is totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. And the way to deal with it is to strengthen and keep NATO completely united and help Ukraine where we can."                                                                                                                      , Biden emphasized that he was speaking from the heart following a meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "I'd just come from being with those families," he said, adding, "I make no apologies for it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The President also dismissed the suggestion that his remarks might escalate the conflict in Ukraine. Biden said the suggestion that other leaders may take issue with his unscripted remarks during his address in Poland has not weakened NATO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "NATO has never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been as strong as it is today," Biden said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The improvised comment about Putin wasn't planned and surprised aides who were watching Biden's speech on television or at the event site. And the words hadn't been something Biden raised as potentially including in his speech -- previously, US officials were adamant that changing the government in Moscow wasn't one of their objectives. In closed-door meetings earlier in the week, Biden told fellow leaders at NATO that he did not want to escalate the West's confrontation with Russia., Yet his off-the-cuff line did more to pit him directly against Putin than anything so far in the conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , 'He's a butcher'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , People who spoke to Biden before and after the speech described him as personally affected after visiting with refugees at the national stadium in Warsaw, where women asked him to pray for the men -- husbands, sons and brothers -- who had stayed behind to fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Asked by reporters traveling with the President what seeing the refugees made him think as he deals with Putin every day, Biden responded, "He's a butcher."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Directly ahead of the speech, the President had also been briefed by officials about a series of missile strikes on a fuel depot in Lviv, Ukraine, a western city not far from the Polish border. The timing seemed hardly coincidental as Biden was visiting Warsaw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Despite the Biden administration's quick walk-back of the comments about Putin's power, they obscured the rest of Biden's speech, which focused on reassuring NATO allies the US would come to their defense if Putin pushes further into Europe. White House aides had been working on writing the speech for days, including in the hours leading up to the address.                                                                                                                                  , Vinay Reddy, Biden's top speechwriter, and Mike Donilon, his senior adviser who helps craft the President's major speeches, both traveled to Europe with Biden and were involved in writing the speech.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A pattern emerges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The clarification the White House issued on Saturday was at least the third time an administration official felt obliged to clean up remarks Biden made that appeared, on their own, startling and misaligned with US foreign policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , As he was hailing the heroism of the Ukrainians, Biden told US troops, "You're going to see when you're there" -- even though he's vowed American forces won't be entering the conflict directly. Afterward, a spokesman said nothing had changed: "The President has been clear we are not sending US troops to Ukraine."                                                                                                                                                                              , On Monday, Biden pushed back on any suggestion he'd told US troops stationed in Poland they were going to Ukraine, telling a reporter, "We were talking about helping train the troops that are the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland.

The interaction is in regard to security assistance being sent from the US to Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                        , In Europe, after Biden had said he would respond "in kind" to the use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine, Sullivan assured reporters the United States has "no intention of using chemical weapons period, under any circumstance."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Biden has a well-established pattern of speaking out of hand, though perhaps never with stakes so high. White House officials said before Biden's speech the President had been working intently behind the scenes to reinforce cooperation among his counterparts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "He sleeps way less on these kinds of trips than maybe other trips because he's just going, going, going -- like, wants to talk to the next leader; you know, take the next briefing," Sullivan said Friday midway through Biden's flight from Brussels to Rzeszów, in southeastern Poland, where he was meeting with American soldiers.                                                                                                                                                                , Europe still measuring its reaction to Biden's remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , It remains to be seen exactly how the remark will affect the conflict. A European diplomat suggested Biden's statement would not have a broader impact on the Kremlin's handling of the war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "(The Russians are) going to worry if we start bringing tanks into Ukraine. They won't care about this," the diplomat said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The diplomat also told CNN, "Biden said something a lot of people believe."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "In the short term, it might be a bit uncomfortable, but it could be a bit helpful for the Russians to know. ... Ultimately, Putin can't stay in power, right?

It would have given some in Russia hope that the regime can change."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Russia is always ambiguous, always blurs lines between war and peace.

"He's not effected by anyone else, including, unfortunately, his own advisers. This is a guy who goes to the beat of his own drummer. And the idea he is going to do something outrageous because I called him for what he was and what he's doing, I think, is just not rational."                                                                                            , 'I wouldn't use terms like that'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Officially, the Kremlin's response came from spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said the fate of the Russian ruler is "not to be decided by Mr. Biden."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Peskov then said on Monday that the comments "are certainly causing concern," adding, "We will continue to closely monitor the statements of the US President.

I just wish he would stay on script."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "This administration has done everything they can to stop escalating," Risch said, adding, "There's not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than to call for regime change."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Rep. Michael McCaul, lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told "State of the Union," "I know it was off-the-cuff, but whatever the President says, it carries a lot of weight. ...

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cadbury shrinks size of Dairy Milk sharing bar </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cadbury has shrunk the size of its Dairy Milk sharing bars by 10%, but will not reduce the price for customers.

      , Parent company Mondelez blamed costs associated with the production of its chocolate spiking, as it reduced the bars' size from 200g to 180g.

the size of a product while keeping the price the same to boost profits.

Meanwhile, state-owned Russian gas supplier, Gazprombank, has confirmed that it is considering a bid for what may be a multibillion-rand contract for South Africa to secure natural gas, which, if awarded, would raise questions on whether South Africa’s stance on Ukraine is being influenced by the need for gas. </td>

Telecom Italia (1.4%) also closed higher after confirming it received a non-binding proposal from CVC capital partners for a minority stake in the services branch of the telecom. The proposal came while Telecom Italia is already assessing KKR &amp; Co.’s $12 billion takeover bid, despite the telecom’s recent profit warnings and downgrading.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Palm Oil Remains Stuck in Narrow Range </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Palm oil futures bottomed around the MYR 6,000 region, pulling back from a rally that saw the benchmark hit a record high of MYR 7,200 earlier this month, pressured by a slump in crude prices and Indonesia's decision to remove its export restrictions on palm oil products. The world's top producer has raised its export levy instead of asking producers to sell 30% of their planned exports to the domestic market, marking a new bid to stabilize domestic prices. On top of that, the Malaysian Palm Oil Council forecast a slight rise in 2022 global output, with Malaysia's production seen at 18.9 million tonnes and Indonesia's at 47.1 million tonnes. Still, fundamentals in the palm oil complex continue to be supported by tight supply due to the drought season in South America and supply bottlenecks for sunflower oil in the Black Sea region. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Ukrainian forces "continue to maintain circular defense" in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian general staff said early Tuesday, even as Russian forces consolidated control around the southeastern port city.                                                                                                                                                              , On Monday, the mayor of Mariupol said that evacuation corridors had come largely under the control of Russian forces, after weeks of bombardment left the city in pieces, killed an unknown number of civilians and forced hundreds of thousands of residents from their homes.                                                                                                                        , "Not everything is in our power," said Mayor Vadym Boichenko, in a live television interview.

Ukrainian officials, however, say thousands were being forcibly "deported" to Russia.                                                                                                                                                              , "We need a complete evacuation from Mariupol," Boichenko said. "Our most important mission today is to save every life ... And there are hopes that we will succeed. For example, there are 26 buses that have to go to Mariupol to evacuate, but unfortunately, they haven't received permission to move," he said.                                                                                   , "And this game is played every day. A cynical game like, 'Yes, we are ready. You can drive there,' but in fact it does not work," he said. "Our heroic drivers under the fire are trying to reach the places where Mariupol residents can be picked up, and they are waiting with the hope that they will have such an opportunity. But the Russian Federation has been playing with us since day one.",                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Statistics released by Ukrainian officials on Sunday paint a grim picture of what has come from weeks of shelling and urban combat in Mariupol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Some 90% of residential buildings in the city were damaged, the data shows.

Also damaged were three maternity hospitals (one destroyed), seven institutes of higher education (three destroyed), and 57 schools and 70 kindergartens, with 23 and 28 destroyed, respectively.                                                                                 , A number of factories were damaged and the city's port sustained damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , According to those official statistics, up to 140,000 people left the city before it was surrounded, and around 150,000 managed to leave during the blockade.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian dollar hit 1.255 against its US counterpart, retreating from a 2-month high of 1.246 hit in the previous session tracking a fall in oil prices and as traders moved to price in increased rate hike bets. Oil, one of Canada’s major exports, fell amid expectations of weaker fuel demand in China after Shanghai announced a phased lockdown to contain the surging COVID cases. Meanwhile, Canada’s central bank is expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points during the April 13th meeting and 200 basis points further this year after rising the borrowing cost this month for the first time since March 2020. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The U.S. House of Representatives is likely to pass the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act) by a slim margin when it comes up for a vote as early as Friday but the measure will not likely pass the Senate, Beacon Policy Advisors LLC analyst Andrew Lokay said in a note on Monday. Lokay said the MORE Act would require 60 votes in the Senate, and it's likely to fall short. Lokay said it's possible the SAFE Banking Act to give cannabis companies more access to financial services could pass this year. "Once it has become clear that it doesn't have enough support to move forward....at that point, [Senate Majority Leader] Schumer could allow SAFE Banking to be attached as an amendment to must-pass legislation," Lokay said.

The SPAC is backed by founder Jason Mudrick, who invested $100 million in AMC in December 2020 to help keep the company afloat during the coronavirus pandemic, according to The Wall Street Journal. AMC also raised $230.5 million by selling 8.5 million shares to Mudrick in June. , In addition to the investment from AMC and Sprott, Hycroft completed a $138.6 million at-the-market offering this month, raising a total of $194.4 million in gross proceeds.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Newcastle coal futures bottomed below $300 per tonne, a level not seen in a month, as demand in China is easing and prices of other energy commodities moderate. The latest coronavirus-induced restrictions in China, particularly in Shanghai and Tangshan, hurt demand and led to increased inventories at mines. Still, coal prices have almost doubled since the beginning of 2022, fueled by supply constraints in the energy market due to the Russia Ukraine war, floods in Australia, and a partial ban of exports from Indonesia. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Heating oil futures fell to below $3.9 a gallon, moving away from an all-time high of $4.45 hit in early March and tracking crude oil prices. Renewed mobility curbs in China due to Covid eased fears over the tight market and Europe failed to impose sanctions on Russia’s energy sector.  Forecasts point to colder weather and higher heating demand this week than previously expected but projections for next week are lower. Meanwhile, investors continue to monitor efforts to restore the Iran nuclear deal, which could add additional supplies of 1.3 million oil barrels to global markets. The latest data from the EIA Petroleum Status Report showed US heating oil stocks rose 316 thousand barrels in the week ended March 18th, after a 123 thousand increase in the previous period. US distillate stockpiles which include diesel and heating oil fell by 2.071 million barrels to 112.1 million barrels, the lowest since April 2014 and above market expectations of a 1.386-million-barrel drop. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Zimbabwe Inflation Rate Hits 9-Month High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Zimbabwe’s annual consumer price inflation climbed to 72.7% in March of 2022, from 66.1% in the prior month, reaching its highest point since last June. Main upward pressure came from transportation (84.2% vs 66.6% in February) and food (75.1% vs 69.3%), as rising fuel and bread prices have triggered a wave of price hikes of basic commodities around the country. Zimbabwe’s annual inflation has been gradually rising since September last year, with monetary authorities attributing this to the parallel exchange rates pass-through effect on domestic inflation witnessed toward the end of last year. On a monthly basis, consumer prices advanced 6.6%, following a 7% rise in the previous month. </td>

A five-page document on standards of conduct that accompanied it spells out behavior the organization deems unacceptable. It prohibits “physical contact that is uninvited and, in the situation, inappropriate and unwelcome, or coercive sexual attention.” Also not allowed is “intimidation, stalking, abusive or threatening behavior, or bullying.”                                                                                                                         , Disciplinary action, according to the bylaws, could include “suspension of membership or expulsion from membership.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The Academy was not known to have expelled a member before 2017, when Harvey Weinstein was removed amid allegations of sexual harassment and rape. Then, in 2018, after adopting a code of conduct for members, the organization expelled Bill Cosby, who had been convicted of sexual assault, and the filmmaker Roman Polanski, who had fled the country years earlier while awaiting sentencing for statutory rape.                                                                                                                 , The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the union representing thousands of people who work in film, television and radio, called the incident “unacceptable” but said that it “does not comment on any pending member disciplinary process.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Violence or physical abuse in the workplace is never appropriate and the union condemns any such conduct,” the union said in a statement Monday. “The incident involving Will Smith and Chris Rock at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The incident unfolded Sunday night after Mr. Rock made a joke about the buzzed hair of Mr. Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia, a condition that leads to hair loss. Mr. Smith responded by walking onto the stage of the Dolby Theater and slapping Mr. Rock, leaving stunned viewers wondering at first if the blow might have been scripted until Mr. Smith returned to his seat and warned him to stop talking about his wife, using expletives.                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Behind the scenes at the Oscars, there were serious discussions about removing Mr. Smith from the theater, according to two industry officials with knowledge of the situation who were granted anonymity to describe internal deliberations. But time was short, because the best actor award, which Mr. Smith was heavily favored to win, was fast approaching, one noted — and stakeholders had varying opinions on how to proceed. There was also concern about further disrupting the live broadcast, the other said.             , As the show went on, the actor Denzel Washington spoke with Mr. Smith during a commercial break. Not long after that Mr. Smith won best actor. (Mr. Smith said in his speech that Mr. Washington had told him: “At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you.”) In his onstage remarks, Mr. Smith apologized to the academy and to his fellow nominees — but not to Mr. Rock — and defiantly sought to draw parallels to the character he played in “King Richard,” the father of Venus and Serena Williams., “Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family,” Mr. Smith said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , He received a standing ovation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Smith said in his statement Monday that he had reacted emotionally because a joke about his wife’s medical condition was “too much for me to bear.” Mr. Smith also apologized to the Academy, the show’s producers, the viewers, the people who worked on “King Richard” and the Williams family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “I deeply regret that my behavior has stained what has been an otherwise gorgeous journey for all of us,” he said. “I am a work in progress.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The incident overshadowed the awards. On ABC’s “Good Morning America,” on Monday George Stephanopoulos described it as “something we have never seen before, something that is very hard to process: Will Smith, walking up onto that stage after Chris Rock told a joke about his wife — simply assaulting Chris Rock.”                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The powers-that-be at the Oscars had been intent on not repeating last year’s record-low ratings, putting a series of changes in place they had hoped would draw more viewers: installing three comic actresses as hosts, pretaping some awards to try to quicken the pace, introducing a fan-favorite award that viewers could vote on. But the broadcast became must-see television for a reason they did not anticipate.                                                                                                            , “Welp … I said it wouldn’t be boring #Oscars,” Will Packer, one of the show’s producers, tweeted after the show. He later added: “This was a very painful moment for me. On many levels.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The telecast drew a larger audience than last year’s, but interest remained depressed compared with past years. The awards show attracted 15.4 million viewers on ABC, a 56 percent improvement on the 9.85 million people who watched the 2021 event, according to ABC. Sunday night’s show was still the second least-watched Oscars ever.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Comedians, who tell uncomfortable and sometimes offensive jokes for a living, raised concerns about the precedent Smith had set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “Let me tell you something, it’s a very bad practice to walk up onstage and physically assault a comedian,” Kathy Griffin tweeted. “Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Jimmy Kimmel, the comedian and talk show host who had been the last person to host the Oscars, said on “The Bill Simmons Podcast” that he felt bad for the show’s hosts; for Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson, who won the best documentary feature award Mr. Rock had been presenting, and for Mr. Rock, who he said “certainly didn’t deserve that.”                                                                                                                                                                                       , “In a way, I feel bad for Will Smith too, because I think he let his emotions get the better of him, and this should have been one of the great nights of his life,” Mr. Kimmel said. “And now it’s not. Was there anyone who didn’t like Will Smith an hour ago in the world? Like no one, right? Now he doesn’t have a single comedian friend — that’s for sure.”                                                                                                                                                                    , Whoopi Goldberg, who is on the academy’s board of governors and has hosted the show several times, said on “The View” on Monday that she did not think Smith’s award would be revoked, citing Mr. Rock’s decision not to press charges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “We’re not going to take that Oscar from him,” she said. “There will be consequences, I’m sure.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The Los Angeles Police Department said it was aware of what it described as an incident involving “one individual slapping another” at the Oscars.

Jada is going to boycott the Oscars — Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna’s panties.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures fell to below $5.5 per million British thermal units from a 20-week high of $5.65, tracking a broad drop in energy markets and prospects of lower demand next week. Refinitiv projected average US gas demand, including exports, would drop to 98.4 bcfd next week from 106.0 bcfd this week as the weather turns seasonally milder. Still, prices remain close to levels not seen since last November, as US LNG exports are near record highs as Europe replaces Russian supplies after Moscow invaded Ukraine. The US struck new a gas deal with the European Union, securing an additional volume of at least 15 billion cubic meters of LNG to Europe this year, with a long-term goal of ensuring 50 billion cubic meters per year until 2030. Forecasts for colder weather and higher heating demand this week than previously expected also capped losses. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biden proposes new minimum tax on billionaires, unrealized gains </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sen. Kevin Cramer, N.D., discusses Biden's comments on sanctions amid ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's 'Marshall Plan' for U.S. energy and what to expect from the president's budget.                                                                                                                                             , President Biden on Monday unveiled a new minimum tax targeting billionaires as part of his 2023 budget request, proposing a 20% rate that would hit both the income and unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest Americans.                                                                                                                            , The "Billionaire Minimum Income Tax" would establish a 20% minimum tax on all U.S. households worth more than $100 million, or about 0.01% of Americans. The White House projected that more than half the revenue generated by the tax would stem from the country's 700 billionaires.                                                                  , THESE STATES ROLLED BACK THEIR GASOLINE TAXES.

"He also believes that it is wrong for America to have a tax code that results in America’s wealthiest households paying a lower tax rate than working families."                               , Under the proposal, the top sliver of U.S. households would be required to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, or the combination of wage income and whatever they made in unrealized gains. If a billionaire is not paying 20% on their income, they will owe a "top-up payment" that makes up the difference to meet the new minimum. , Households that are paying 20% will not be required to pay an additional tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Because many of the ultra-rich derive their vast wealth from the soaring value of assets like stock and property – which are not considered to be taxable income unless that individual sells – they are able to legally store their fortunes and reduce their tax bite. Under current law, a gain is only taxed if and when the owner sells the asset.  , Night falls at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 2, 2021. ( AP Photo/J.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., killed a different spending plan that included tax hikes on well-off corporations and Americans earning more than $400,000.                                               , It remains unclear whether congressional Democrats will approve of Biden's plan to tax billionaires and ultra-millionaires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Manchin called a different billionaires' tax proposal from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., "convoluted," but has since suggested that he could support some type of levy targeting the richest Americans.                                                                                                                                                        , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Biden also proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% as part of his budget request and pitched a global minimum tax that's designed to crack down on offshore tax havens.                                                                                                                                                                  , Under his envisioned budget, the nation's deficit would shrink by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. In fiscal year 2021, the federal deficit reached nearly $2.8 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while the national debt ballooned past $30 trillion.  </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Major indexes in the US stock market opened primarily flat on Monday as investors cautiously welcomed calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that his county could adopt a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. Still, lingering concerns that rising inflation and higher interest rates will drag the nation’s economy into a recession kept sentiment in check. Markets were recalibrating the higher possibility of a 50-bps hike in May following hawkish comments from several policymakers last week. Investors now look forward to the monthly jobs report, PCE inflation, and consumer confidence data in the US to guide the outlook for monetary policy. On the corporate side, Tesla jumped almost 5% after the company said it would seek investor approval for a stock split. On the flip side, Apple shares were trading in negative territory after a report that the company planned to cut iPhone and AirPod output as rising inflation dented pent-up demand. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, was down 0.6% to around 118,355 on Monday, as investors booked some profits after eight consecutive sessions of gains that sent the index to the highest in nearly seven months. Oil companies were among the worst performers, tracking lower oil prices. Traders also continued to assess inflation concerns and the consequences of the war in Ukraine, as well as the chances for progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Also, pandemic worries resurfaced after soaring Covid-19 cases forced fresh lockdowns in China. Meanwhile, Brazil's central bank financial markets' weekly survey for 2022 showed IPCA forecasts climbed for the eleventh straight week to 6.86% from 6.59% a week earlier. Inflation forecasts for 2023 also increased to 3.80% from 3.75%. The estimates of economic growth for 2022 and 2023 were kept unchanged at 0.50% and 1.30%, respectively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on China's 10-year government bond was around 2.8%, remaining close to low levels not seen since June 2020, and defying a global rally in borrowing costs, on concerns that fast tightening in the US could drive the world’s biggest economy into a recession. As opposed to the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world, analysts expect the PBoC to resume its loosening monetary policy in April, as the economy remains under significant downside risks from the fast-spreading omicron subvariant BA.2 and the elevated global commodity prices, as well as the war in Ukraine. </td>

"If the economy is healthy and growing, longer-term Treasury rates should be higher than shorter-term rates. When the reverse happens, concerns start to mount about the future state of the economy.", The more closely watched spread between the 2- and 10-year note yields is also narrowing, falling from a high of 1.56% to less than 0.2% in the span of just one year. That is the flattest the spread has been in two years, before the pandemic took hold and triggered an extremely deep but short recession.                                                                                      , Every recession in the past 60 years was preceded by an inverted yield curve, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The bond market movement comes as the Fed takes a more hawkish approach to fight inflation: Policymakers raised rates by a quarter-percentage point two weeks ago, and have since signaled support for a faster, half-percentage point increase at their May meeting.                                                                                                                                 , A man walks past the U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington on April 29, 2020.  (Xinhua/Liu Jie via Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "If we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so," Chairman Jerome Powell said last week during an economics conference. "And if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and into a more restrictive stance, we will do that as well."          , The Labor Department reported earlier this month that the consumer price index rose 7.9% in February from the previous year, marking the fastest increase since January 1982, when inflation hit 8.4%. The CPI – which measures a bevy of goods ranging from gasoline to health care – rose 0.8% from January.                                                                                        , Some economists believe the Fed waited too long to confront the burst in inflation, while others have expressed concerns that moving too quickly to stabilize prices risks triggering an economic recession. Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumers and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.                                , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Still, Powell has pushed back against concern that an inverted yield curve signals the economy is headed for a recession and maintained optimism that the Fed can strike a delicate balance between taming inflation without crushing the economy.                                                                                                                                                    , "The probability of a recession in the next year is not particularly elevated," Powell told reporters two weeks ago, citing the strong labor market, solid payroll growth and strong business and household balance sheets. "All signs are that this is a strong economy, and one that will be able to flourish in the face of less accommodative monetary policy."  </td>

The bank limited activity to only 33 blue chips last week when equity trading resumed following a month-long suspension. Authorities still kept certain limitations in place to prevent a steeper selloff, including a ban on short sales and prohibition on foreigners from selling Russian shares. As a result, New York’s pension systems were unable to dump nearly $300 million worth of investments in the Moscow stock market. Before the invasion of Ukraine, foreigners owned around three-quarters of the free float on MOEX, with analysts suggesting that current moves in the market do not reflect the real value of Russian stocks.

The BOJ has set 0.25% as the implicit upper limit of its tolerance under its yield curve control (YCC) policy, which pegs the benchmark at around zero. Last week, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that the central bank was in no rush to withdraw stimulus and that any increase in inflation must be accompanied by steady rises in wages, jobs and corporate profits. Recent data showed Japan's annual inflation rate accelerated to 0.9% in February, the most since April 2019; while core consumer prices were up 0.6%, the most in two years but remained below the BoJ's target of 2%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rubber Prices Remain Near ¥250 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rubber futures were trading above JPY 250 per kilogram, remaining close to the 10-month high of JPY 250 hit in late February as investors were weighting weaker yen, tight supply, and a rise in crude oil prices against expectations of lower demand from China. Heavy rain in Thailand in recent weeks has affected rubber tapping while the supply is limited as Thailand enters the dry season. Meanwhile, the demand from China is expected to slow down as the strict Covid restrictions including a partial lockdown of Shanghai are set to affect factories. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY This market is setting up for a spectacular fall. 
Recency bias has seemingly erased the horror of Jan, Feb and early March. 
The recent run seems like a hopeful turn, but unfortunately inflation will continue to rise, interest rates will continue to rise, the fed’s balance sheet will begin to be shrunk and corporate earnings are essentially forced to fall off a cliff. 
Thus, the 2yr/10yr about-to-be inverted yield curve and its 100% predictive rate of the past 8 recessions is looming. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ On March 8, 1940, Finland agreed to Soviet&amp;#39;s terms for peace after the Soviets invaded the territory just like Ukraine. If Ukraine negotiates for peace on Putin&amp;#39;s original terms, Russia actually won this war. It was a huge cost, but they would technically be called the victors. If Zelenskyy gives Putin what he wants, the Ukrainian people will be unsatisfied with Zelenskyy for selling out. As Putin is a greedy, stubborn man, I don&amp;#39;t see anything coming out of these peace talks. </td>

Still waiting for confirmation. I need to see a very strong rejection at resistance before I jump in any long expiration puts. Why do you ask, well because I don&amp;#39;t bet blind? These bear market pumps can last longer than anticipated. So while I&amp;#39;m extremely bearish, I&amp;#39;m not holding any puts as of this post. I need to see a strong rejection around $4590/$4600. If not, no puts yet. As crazy as this sounds, if this pump can take down $4590 and confirms over $4640 this pump could keep going all the way to $4760. The only reason I&amp;#39;m saying this is that the CPI numbers won&amp;#39;t come out till May 12 that would be the AHA moment if they keep this low-volume pump going.

Basically erasing their tax obligations. Effectively, this could technically make taxes even LESS for billionaires. Would need to read the fine print of the payment installment plans. </td>

Did anyone else hear the news?

On Friday April 1, 2022

Biden
Putin 
Zelensky
Will Smith 
Chris Rock 

Have all agreed to meet in Jerusalem  with Trump and Obama for a Beer Summit.

Goal is for all of them to hug out their differences and usher in World Peace… lower taxes and lower emissions.

The lower emissions is of course contingent on Putin agreeing to the non Doritos policy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ On March 8, 1940, Finland agreed to Soviet&amp;#39;s terms for peace after the Soviets invaded the territory just like Ukraine. If Ukraine negotiates for peace on Putin&amp;#39;s original terms, Russia actually won this war. It was a huge cost, but they would technically be called the victors. If Zelenskyy gives Putin what he wants, the Ukrainian people will be unsatisfied with Zelenskyy for selling out. As Putin is a greedy, stubborn man, I don&amp;#39;t see anything coming out of these peace talks. </td>

We have CPI inflation at the highest level in 40+ years at 8% and a FED that admits they are behind the curve and should have started raising rates earlier. 
 
Yet they only raise rates to 0.25% while calling themselves &amp;quot;aggressive&amp;quot; in dealing with inflation 
 
I have never seen such a blatant yet universally disregarded lie in my lifetime.

So technically in a few years (after paying the minimum balance like on your credit card), the billionaires can elect a new president and get rid of the old tax code. Basically erasing their tax obligations. Effectively, this could technically make taxes even LESS for billionaires. Would need to read the fine print of the payment installment plans. </td>

Even the 10y at 2.47% and the Fed funds at 0.25% vs rising inflation at 7.9% CPLie (16% using 1980s CPI) means the real yield is deeply negative and going negative faster than nominal yields rise.

Also the Fed does 0.25% bait and switch hikes as it’s balance sheet continues to go parabolic. Bears falling for the trap. Get with the inflate, tax and lie program or get rekt. 😂🤣🤑📈📈

Modern growth rates are not yet understood, bulls could be wrong, but so could bears. $TSLA bears have been whining about the “astronomical” price to earnings metrics. However, when Tesla first achieved profitability in Q2 2020, and their P/E ratio was 500-1000. If Tesla stock had stayed flat since then and they had the same growth performance, they would have a P/E ratio of 33. That’s not counting the incredible growth to be brought on by giga Berlin and Austin. Growth is very misunderstood. There is a bubble, but there are a lot of companies people assume to be apart of that bubble which are actually strong companies. </td>

Venting session:

It’s absolutely amazing how you can work hard for half a decade to get a good credit score, then have one accidental missed payment drop you score 60-100 points. 

I had a payment set to be processed on the 29th of every month for a personal loan, not realizing Feb ended on the 28th…so the payment went through on March 1st instead. Thus making Feb show up as late…it’s absolutely mind boggling how one day can ruin a half of decades worth of work and on time payments…the government is 33 trillion dollars in debt, but that’s okay… </td>

There are probably other charting programs with these features, I’m not trying to sell the one I mentioned, but my point is this seems like the quickest and easiest way to learn about indicators for those interested.

Bought a few puts on $AAPL and $AMD at close. Small size, comfortable with cutting for a small loss tomorrow at open or getting a big win off these. $AAPL has not had 10 Green Day’s in a row since October of last year.

Biden
Putin 
Zelensky
Will Smith 
Chris Rock 

Have all agreed to meet in Jerusalem  with Trump and Obama for a Beer Summit.

Goal is for all of them to hug out their differences and usher in World Peace… lower taxes and lower emissions.

The lower emissions is of course contingent on Putin agreeing to the non Doritos policy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA you can not be a successful bear trader if your strategy is based on your feelings of valuations or the company. You cant allow yourself to get emotionally attached to your narrative. It may be logical and even right in the end. Doesnt help you if you allow yourself to get smoked by numerous surges to share price. 

Shorting the market or stocks is kind of like options in correlation to poker. Its is playing with your hand up. Burry nearly closed his entire put position as soon as he reported it. To me holding short positions for long holds is a mistake. 

Now being a short day trader can be quite lucrative because human nature and some corrupt algos always have moments of irrational fomo that overruns. Leaving oppos for nice neat quick 10pt + scalps. I shared all my moves for a year to prove my pt. You can still make on green days as a bear trader. If you cant then you there is no pt of being a perma bear. 

In the end real success is when you learn to trade the game both ways. </td>
