   <td style="text-align:left;"> Boris Johnson was once a political magician. Now his party fears he's run out of tricks - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> London (CNN)Has Boris Johnson lost his touch? That's the question the United Kingdom was asking itself on Friday morning, after the governing Conservative party lost a parliamentary seat in a by-election that it had held for nearly 200 years.                                                                                                                                , The North Shropshire seat flipped from a 23,000 Conservative majority to a 6,000 Liberal Democrat win. In private, Johnson's lawmakers are talking seriously about how long he can carry on as UK Prime Minister. They are worried this result shows voters are catching onto the idea of tactical voting and that Johnson's ability to lock down Brexit voters might have waned. , The loss comes in the same week that Johnson's own MPs openly defied him by voting against new Covid measures in parliament. Some 99 Conservatives defied the PM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The election in North Shropshire, in central England, only took place because of a catastrophic own goal by the Prime Minister. Last month, Johnson whipped Conservative Members of Parliament to vote on an amendment that would overturn the 30-day suspension of their colleague Owen Paterson.                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Paterson had been founding guilty of breaching lobbying rules, personally contacting government ministers on behalf of companies that paid him an amount that totaled Â£100,000 ($136,000).                                                                                                                                                                                        , After days of fury from people all over the political divide, Paterson resigned his North Shropshire seat. Between Paterson's resignation and Thursday's by-election, Johnson has been drowning in scandals that have wrecked his poll numbers and posed serious questions about his leadership.                                                                                  , Johnson has spent the past two weeks fighting off allegations that he and his associates held illegal parties in Downing Street while the rest of the country was in varying degrees of lockdown. The Prime Minister has insisted that he believes no rules were broken, and has asked one of his top civil servants to investigate the alleged parties.                          , Prior to that, he had been dogged by accusations that he accepted improper donations to fund a renovation, while his government has been accused of handing lucrative Covid contracts to people with links to the Conservative party. Johnson's spokesman has insisted he has "acted in accordance with the rules at all times."                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Suffice to say, all of this is a stark turnaround for a man who won a landslide election just two years ago. And it's no surprise that figures within the party are now talking seriously about removing Johnson from power.                                                                                                                                                      , The Conservative Party was never in love with Johnson as such. He took over as leader of the party and the country because his predecessor, Theresa May, had run out of road and couldn't deliver Brexit.                                                                                                                                                                         , Conservative MPs had resisted a Johnson leadership campaign in the past. He was seen as a showman and a fantastic cheerleader, but fundamentally too chaotic and untrustworthy to lead.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Brexit changed everything. In 2019, Conservative MPs held their noses and did a deal with Johnson: Get Brexit over the line and win us an election. Johnson did both things and consequently was given the keys to the car, and allowed to drive it however he liked.                                                                                                             , That was all well and good while he looked bulletproof. But Conservatives are now worried the PM is so weighed down with scandals and sleaze, he has passed a point of no return. They also fear that 2022 will be harder than 2021.                                                                                                                                              , The Omicron variant peak will pass and the economic, societal and public health consequences of another Christmas wrecked by Covid will be impossible to ignore. Johnson will be the face of these issues and the blame will rest squarely on him.                                                                                                                                , "He goes into the new year with problems piling up. The cost of living will rise, there might be supply chain shortages. And he's facing all these problems with no ideological base or friends in the party," says a former senior cabinet minister.                                                                                                                             , "He has a finite window to improve -- but few believe he will seize it," says a senior MP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , If Johnson's number really is up, removing him from office will be extremely painful and difficult to negotiate. Calling a vote in his leadership now will be very hard. As the former cabinet minister pointed out, "local associations tend to be loyal to leaders," which will make it hard for their MPs to call for Johnson's head.                                          , A botched leadership challenge would mean Johnson is immune from another challenge for 12 months -- and it seems most unlikely he would resign in that time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The second, arguably more important issue, is who might replace him? There are other popular cabinet ministers who clearly have leadership ambitions. But given how difficult 2022 looks, who on earth would want to take the poisoned chalice?                                                                                                                                   , However, the longer he remains in office, the more likely it is he stays for the next scheduled election in 2024. If recent polls are to be believed, that election could see the Conservatives lose a lot of seats.                                                                                                                                                              , It's surreal that as recently as October, Johnson seemed untouchable. No matter what happened -- fuel shortages, huge Covid numbers, people drowning in the English Channel -- his polling numbers remained strong enough to win an election.                                                                                                                                     , The past two weeks might be an indication that the magic has started to wear off. And if that's the case, Conservatives will have to find some way of silencing their head cheerleader who has suddenly become the least popular kid in class.                                                                                                                                    , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Harris defends Biden when questioned whether he or Manchin is President - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris forcefully defended President Joe Biden when recently asked whether he or Sen. Joe Manchin is the president of the United States, as Biden's agenda remains stalled in part because of the West Virginia Democrat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "So, who is the real president of this country, is it Joe Manchin or Joe Biden, Madam Vice President?" Charlamagne tha God asked Harris on Comedy Central's "Tha God's Honest Truth," in a clip released ahead of the interview set to air Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "C'mon Charlamagne. C'mon, it's Joe Biden," Harris said to the late-night talk show host. "I can't tell sometimes," he retorted, before Harris cut him off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "No, no, no, no.

But we will not give up and I will not give up," she added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Harris, in another clip released from the interview, said it was a mistake to blame only Democrats for not passing the President's priorities, instead putting the onus on Republicans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "I think it's a mistake to try and think about this only through the lens of Democrats versus Democrats when the fact is Republicans are consistently and unanimously standing in the way of progress," Harris said. "So, let's put the emphasis where it really needs to be, which is how is it that today and in this year of our Lord 2021 in America and on some basic issues like upholding our democracy, we can't get bipartisan support."                                                                          , Democrats, facing a number of sticking points on Biden's sweeping social safety net expansion that remain unresolved, are hoping for a breakthrough that will allow them to pass the legislation known as Build Back Better in the new year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Democratic leadership had initially pushed for a Senate vote on Build Back Better before Christmas, but action on the legislation has been delayed for a variety of reasons. Earlier this week, CNN reported that critical talks between Biden and Manchin, a critical swing vote, remained far from a resolution on a series of issues. Lawmakers are also grappling with how to resolve policy disputes such as how to deal with a controversial state and local tax deduction and legislative text is not yet finalized., On Thursday, Biden implicitly acknowledged in a lengthy statement that ongoing negotiations with Manchin and procedural steps would cause Democrats to miss the self-imposed Christmas deadline for Senate passage of the package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "My team and I are having ongoing discussions with Senator Manchin; that work will continue next week," Biden said in the statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "It takes time to finalize these agreements, prepare the legislative changes, and finish all the parliamentary and procedural steps needed to enable a Senate vote," he continued. "We will advance this work together over the days and weeks ahead; Leader (Chuck) Schumer and I are determined to see the bill successfully on the floor as early as possible."                                                                                                                                                         , The President reiterated, however, that he still believes the bill will eventually pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Clare Foran contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Appeals court lets Biden administration enforce vaccine rules for large employers - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The Biden administration scored a significant victory Friday in its court battles to enforce various federal Covid-19 vaccine mandates, with an appeals court ruling that the government can enforce its vaccine-or-testing rule for companies with more than 100 employees.                                                                                                 , Soon after the order came down, those challenging the mandate said that they'd turn to the Supreme Court to put it on hold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The decision in favor of employer mandate, from the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, came after a separate appeals court on Friday declined a Justice Department request that it reinstate the administration's federal contractor mandate, which had been blocked nationwide by a federal judge earlier this month.                                                               , A third Biden mandate -- requiring vaccines for certain heath care workers -- is being reviewed by the Supreme Court, after lower courts froze it in half the states in the country.                                                                                                                                                                                               , The 6th Circuit decision allowing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to implement the administration's rules for large employers is a rare victory for President Joe Biden in what has been an uphill battle in conservative-leaning courts that have been hostile to his administration's approach to requiring vaccines.                                          , The OSHA rule had been initially blocked nationwide by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. The various lawsuits targeting the OSHA policy were then consolidated before the 6th Circuit. In a 2-1 vote, the 6th Circuit wiped away the 5th Circuit order halting the OSHA mandate on Friday.                                                                                      , A fight headed to the Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Supreme Court is expected to have the final say on the Biden administration's vaccine mandate, with the cases raising questionsÂ about the federal government's ability to require vaccines as well as claims that the Biden administration violated administrative law in how it rolled out the policies.                                                                      , On Thursday, the Supreme Court was asked by the Justice Department to let the government fully implement a vaccine requirement for health care workers at providers that participate in Medicare orÂ Medicaid. One appeals court has backed the requirement, but two other appeals courts have doubted the mandate's legality, leaving it blocked in half the states in the country., The justices gave those challenging the mandate a December 30 deadline for responding to the DOJ request to reinstate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The administration's federal contractor mandate remains frozen nationwide after the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals left in place on Friday a judge's order blocking enforcement nationwide of the vaccine requirement. The federal contractor mandate may soon head to the Supreme Court as well.                                                                                , This story has been updated with additional details Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , </td>

Risk aversion flooded the markets, as traders digested this weekâs monetary policy tightening announcements by the US Fed, the BoE, and the ECB, raising concerns about whether central banks will manage to bring inflation back to target. At the same time, fears about the omicron variant have been reignited due to how fast it spreads, with cases doubling in European countries every two days.

Daily Covid-19 cases in the UK jumped to a record and continued to rise across Asia, while hospitalizations surged in the US. The International Energy Agency warned that a surge in Covid cases would dent global oil demand at a time when supply is set to increase, especially in the US. A global tightening cycle is also underway, with the Fed signaling three rate hikes next year and the BoE surprising the markets by raising rates for the first time since the pandemic began. Meanwhile, the demand picture appeared robust after official EIA data showed US crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels last week, much more than market expectations for a 2.1 million barrel decrease.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)A Florida man who enthusiastically attacked police at the US Capitol on January 6 with a fire extinguisher, a wooden plank and a pole was sentenced to more than five years in prison on Friday, the longest sentence for a Capitol rioter thus far.                                                                                                                                                                                   , Robert Scott Palmer is the first person to be sentenced for the felony of assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon. His 63-month sentence could set a benchmark for the more than 140 others who face the same charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Every day we are hearing about reports of antidemocratic factions, people plotting potential violence in 2024," District Judge Tanya Chutkan said as she handed down the sentence. "It has to be made clear that trying to stop the peaceful transition of power, assaulting law enforcement, is going to be met with certain punishment. Not staying at home, not watching Netflix, not doing what you were doing before you got arrested.", Palmer was first publicly identified by online sleuths, who tracked him down through pictures and video of Palmer in an American flag jacket brawling outside the Capitol. According to his plea agreement, Palmer sprayed a fire extinguisher at a line of police and twice threw the empty canister. When he refused to back down, Palmer was shot in the stomach with a rubber bullet.                                                    , "I wonder if the people who are usually before me," Chutkan said of Black and minority defendants she presides over, "if they had tried to storm the Capitol that day, would they have been met with rubber bullets.

Seven cases in front of her have reached sentencing, and all seven have received jail time ranging from 14 days to more than five years behind bars.                                                                                                                                  , During the hearing, Palmer said that he saw TV host Rachel Maddow do a segment about his case on MSNBC and was "horrified, absolutely devastated to see myself on there. Just to see the coldness and the calculation going up those steps with the fire extinguisher to spray those officers."                                                                                                                                              , Palmer also said in a letter to the judge that he now realizes former President Donald Trump "lied" to supporters about the election.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "They kept spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was 'our duty' to stand up to tyranny," Palmer wrote. "Little did I realize that they were the tyrannical ones desperate to hold onto power at any cost even by creating the chaos the knew would happen with such rhetoric."                                                                                                                                 , </td>

Temporary federal programs that expanded the jobless safety net expired on Labor Day. Sick people who miss work or self-employed individuals who lose ample earnings, for example, are likely out of luck., "It's ultimately going to be up to the state workforce agency to determine if someone's eligible," said Michele Evermore, a senior policy advisor for unemployment insurance at the U.S. Labor Department.                                                                                                                            , The bottom line: Workers should apply if they think they may qualify, Evermore said. She advised workers be careful how they report data on their application. (One common and costly mistake, for example: reporting no earnings for the week since payday hasn't yet come.)                                                         , Here's what to know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Unemployment benefits are available in instances beyond a layoff; workers who lose significant hours may qualify, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Typically, workers need to lose at least half their weekly work to qualify in most states, according to Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. So, a restaurant worker who loses two of four work shifts due to a temporary Covid shutdown may qualify. Â                               , These "partial" unemployment benefits are a portion of the full amount triggered by an outright job loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Rules around partial benefits (including amount and eligibility) vary by state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , There are many factors that influence your eligibility for benefits. Two primary determinants: earnings history and whether you have collected benefits during the past year.                                                                                                                                                         , Receiving state unemployment insurance starts a "benefit year." This is a 52-week cycle during which you can collect a set amount of weekly benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                 , States determine the weekly amount based on your earnings history, typically over the last four or five full quarters of work.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Workers can generally get up to 26 total weeks of benefits during their benefit year; they can collect that total in fits and starts over multiple rounds of layoffs. (Amount and duration vary widely by state.)                                                                                                                     , For example, let's say a worker collected $250 a week for 13 weeks over the spring and summer of 2021. This person can likely claim $250 a week for another 13 weeks if they lose their job heading into winter.                                                                                                                      , Someone who collected benefits earlier in the pandemic may have a harder time qualifying in the near future. They may have exhausted their maximum 26-week allotment and may need to wait until the clock resets to a new benefit year.                                                                                               , More from Personal Finance:Americans should soon be able to get free at-home Covid testsCredit card debt can get in the way of your retirement savingsConsumer watchdog takes aim at buy now, pay later programs                                                                                                                      , Even if a year has passed, they may not have earned enough since their last layoff to qualify for more assistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "The real question will be, did they work long enough when things opened back up?" Stettner said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , One exception may be "extended benefit" programs, additional weeks of benefits that become available during periods of high joblessness. Extended benefits were only available in four states (Alaska, Connecticut, New Jersey and New Mexico) as of Nov. 27, according to the Labor Department.                                      , In some states, unemployed workers must also be searching for full-time work (and not a part-time job) to be eligible for benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Some workers may need to stay home due to a Covid exposure or if they're sick â and may lose pay as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Workers who need to quarantine because they came in close contact with a person who tests positive may qualify for benefits, Evermore said. States may consider this person "able and available to work," a key component of eligibility.                                                                                             , Perhaps counterintuitively, that likely wouldn't be the case for someone who tests positive for Covid and can't work, Evermore said.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Unemployment insurance was never intended to be paid sick leave," Evermore said. Workers may be able to get a paid-leave benefit from their employer or via a state program, she added.                                                                                                                                              , This wasn't the case earlier in the pandemic. Congress had expanded the pool of workers eligible for unemployment benefits via the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, part of the CARES Act lawmakers passed in March 2020.                                                                                                    , The PUA program offered federal benefits to those who missed work for a host of Covid-related reasons (contracting the virus or caring for a sick individual, for example). It also paid gig workers, the self-employed, independent contractors, freelancers and others who don't generally qualify for state benefits.              , That program lapsed on Labor Day, meaning many of these groups may no longer qualify. Some state labor agencies may determine gig workers and independent contractors to be eligible if they meet certain employment requirements, however, Evermore said.                                                                            , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The central bank of Colombia raised its benchmark interest rate by 50bps to 3.0% on December 17th, as expected. It follows another 50bps rate hike and marks the 3rd consecutive increase as the central bank seeks to control inflation that is well above the target. The decision was not unanimous, with 4 members voting for a 50 bps increase and 3 voting for a 75 bps. According to the monetary authority, the inflation accelerated by 68 bps to 5.3% in October, while core inflation increased by 52 bps to 2.5%. These results motivated the policymaker to revise its year-end forecasts for 2021 and 2022 to 5.3% and 3.7% respectively. In 2022, still above the target of 3%, although below the upper bound of 4%. Also, inflation expectations are risen and remained above the target in the medium term. Meanwhile, preliminary indicators point to a continuation of the economic recovery during the last quarter of 2021, with the GDP above its pre-pandemic level, and growing 9.6% in 2021. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures climbed on Friday to settle above the key $1,800 mark for the first time since Nov. 22, with prices based on the most-active contract posting a gain of about 1.1% for the week. Gold is back above $1,800 and "how it performs for the rest of the year may be tricky given the thin market conditions that will shortly settle in," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. "Omicron remains the biggest risk to the outlook and whether that leads to panic selling of risky assets or triggers some safe-haven flows might have gold trade between the $1,775 and $1,850 trading range for the rest of the year."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks extended losses for the second straight session on Friday heading for a weekly loss, with the Dow Jones shedding more than 500 points, the S&amp;P dipping around 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.4% as investors assess a shift in global monetary policy. Faced with surging inflation, the major central banks signaled a more hawkish stance, raising worries about growth in 2022 while Omicron continues to spread globally. The Federal Reserve signaled three interest rate hikes in 2022 and the Bank of England became the first major central bank to raise rates since the pandemic began. Bank shares including GS, American Express, JPMorgan, and Visa, which were the biggest gainers on Thursday, were sharply down. Also, big tech was under pressure with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet trading lower. On the week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was almost 3% down, while both the S&amp;P and Dow booked nearly 1% loss. </td>

At the same time, traders weighed uncertainties around the impact of the Omicron variant on global economic growth, while also digesting a more hawkish tone from major central banks in the fight against inflation. Locally, South Africaâs health minister said that vaccines and past infections could be a key reason that the current wave of coronavirus infections, fueled by the Omicron variant, appears to be milder. Health officials reported that fewer coronavirus patients require hospitalization despite a rise in the number of COVID-19 infections. The country is set to remain on its lowest "alert level-1" lockdown ahead of the festive season. For the week, the JSE lost 0.7%. </td>

After an initially welcoming reaction to central banksâ monetary policy tightening announcements, concerns were now focused on whether inflation can be brought back to the 2% targets. Losses were led by a 2.5% drop in auto stocks after EU countries recorded the lowest count of new car registrations ever for a November month, totalling just over 713 thousand units, as the impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage dragged on. On the pandemic front, the EUâs drugs regulator approved boosting the manufacturing capacity of COVID-19 vaccines, eyeing risks from the omicron variant.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Roger Stone, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, met briefly Friday with the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot and asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to every question asked, he said.                                                                                                                                                    , Stone emerged from the deposition after only 90 minutes and told reporters he invoked the Fifth Amendment, which offers protection against self-incrimination, "not because I have done anything wrong, but because I am fully aware of the House Democrats' long history of fabricating perjury charges."                                                                           , "I question the legitimacy of this inquiry," Stone said, "based on the fact that Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi rejected the appointment of Republicans to this committee and seated two anti-Trump Republicans. This is witch hunt 3.0."                                                                                                                                                    , "I stress yet again that I was not on the Ellipse.

Also, sustaining the prices, data showed China's iron ore imports hit a 16-month high in November and the industrial production rose 3.8% YoY, accelerating from October, and above market expectations. Prices should continue to rise as Chinese steel firms are set to raise output for the rest of the year after complying with a raft of strict curbs imposed by the government in the past few months, which, coupled with sluggish demand, hit production. </td>

Risk aversion flooded the markets, as traders digested this weekâs monetary policy tightening announcements by the US Fed, the BoE, and the ECB, raising concerns about whether central banks will manage to bring inflation back to target. At the same time, fears about the omicron variant have been reignited due to how fast it spreads, with cases doubling in European countries every two days.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian dollar traded around 1.284 in mid-December, weakening from a nearly one-week high of 1.27933 hit on December 16th, as a more hawkish policy stance from major central banks contrasted with the Bank of Canada statement. Investors were slowly coming to terms that interest rate increases next year are imminent with the Fed signaling three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022, both the BoE and the Norges Bank already increasing their borrowing costs, and the ECB reducing its pace of bond buying. Meanwhile, the BoC dashed investors' expectations for a shift to a more hawkish policy stance as the new variant Omicron had raised uncertainty around the economic recovery. Also, the BoC reached an agreement to keep its inflation target at 2% and aimed to take into consideration the labor market condition in its monetary policy decisions, suggesting that the rates can be lower for longer in times of crisis. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cocoa futures on ICE traded close to $2500 a tonne, after reaching a peak of $ 2627 on December 15th as conducive weather conditions in top growing countries raised the outlook for better crop yields while chocolate consumption remains subdued amid renewed COVID-19 movement restrictions. At the same time, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) in its recent report revised its estimates higher for both demand and production for 2021/2022 cropping season. The report showed that demand for cocoa would go up by 4.9 million tonnes due to increased use of beans whereas production would rise at a faster 5.2 million tonnes due to better weather conditions in major producing countries. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Brazilian real traded around 5.69 per USD, not far from a 7-week low of 5.7357 hit on December 15th, tracking an overall sell-off among the Latam currencies amid concerns over rising inflation, while investors were slowly coming to terms that US rate hikes next year are imminent with the Fed signaling three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, investorsâ perception that the Brazilian economic recovery has begun to succumb to rising inflation and higher interest rates is weighing in the currency appeal. Domestically, the IBC-Br, considered as a monthly preview of GDP, shrank by 0.4% MoM in October, below expectations of a 0.2% decrease, and marking the third consecutive negative reading. On the other hand, Brazilâs central bank minutes showed that the monetary authority had considered a hike bigger than 150 bps amid concerns of fiscal deterioration. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> EU Carbon Permits Slip after Energy Summit </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Prices of EU carbon permits fell to â¬77.2 on Friday, slumping roughly 15% from an all-time high of â¬90.75 hit on December 8th and erasing most of this monthâs gains, as fears about stricter restrictions in the blocâs carbon market faded. After two rounds of heated talks at a summit in Brussels, Poland and her allies positioned themselves against the European Commissionâs plans to reform the carbon market, which sought to make permits more scarce. The ongoing natural gas crunch in Europe has prompted utilities to switch to the cheaper coal, although its combustion releases a lot more greenhouse gasses, bolstering demand for carbon permits. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks fell for the second session on Friday heading for a weekly loss, with the Dow Jones shedding more than 500 points, and both the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq down more than 1% as investors assess a shift in global monetary policy. Faced with surging inflation, the major central banks signaled a more hawkish stance, raising worries about growth in 2022 while Omicron continues to spread globally. The Federal Reserve signaled three interest rate hikes in 2022 and the Bank of England became the first major central bank to raise rates since the pandemic began. Bank shares including GS, American Express, JPMorgan, and Visa, which were the biggest gainers on Thursday, were sharply down. Also, big tech was under pressure with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet dipping 1% each. </td>

        DJIA,
        -1.48%
       fell 209 points, or 0.6%, to 35,689, while the S&amp;P 500

       dropped 0.7% to 15,070.42. The Nasdaq on Thursday suffered its biggest one-day fall since September in a move blamed by analysts on the Federal Reserve's more aggressively hawkish outlook, with the central bank on Wednesday accelerating the wind-down of its asset purchase program and penciling in three rate increases in 2022.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Raising rates would be a positive event for the U.S. economy, New York Fed's Williams says </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The Federal Reserve raising interest rates next year would signal the central bank feels good about the country's economic recovery, New York Fed President John Williams said Friday.                                                                                                                                                             , "I go into next year feeling [like] the baseline outlook is a very good one. Therefore, actually raising interest rates would be a sign of a positive development in terms of where we are in the economic cycle," Williams said in an interview with CNBC's Steve Liesman on "Squawk Box."                                                        , "I'm pretty optimistic that we're seeing really strong improvements in the labor market. You're seeing the unemployment rate come down quickly," Williams added.                                                                                                                                                                                   , His comments came after the Fed signaled earlier this week that it sees as many as three rate hikes in 2022. The Fed cut rates to near-zero levels in March 2020 as part of its efforts to support the economy at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The central bank also said this week it would aggressively dial back its bond-buying program., That rate forecast comes during an increase in U.S. inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The consumer price index â which tracks the price of everything from cars to food to rent â surged 6.8% in November on a year-over-year basis. That marks its fastest acceleration since 1982. The producer price index â another inflation measure that tracks wholesale prices â increased last month by 9.6%, its fastest pace on record.       , "We're very focused on inflation; it is obviously too high right now," Williams said. "We want to make sure inflation comes back down to our 2% longer-run goal."                                                                                                                                                                                  , However, Williams noted that the Fed doesn't need to further speed up the tapering of its asset purchase program to temper the recent inflation surge.                                                                                                                                                                                             , On Wednesday, the Fed announced it will be buying $60 billion in bonds per month starting in January. That's half of what it was buying prior to November. It also puts the Fed on track to wrap up its program by March.                                                                                                                          , "I don't see that there's any real benefit to try to speed it up further," Williams said. "We like to do things in a way that's very carefully studied, very carefully communicated â¦ without creating disruption in markets."                                                                                                                     , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cotton futures remained below 110 USd/Lbs, moving further away from a 10-year high of 120 USd/Lb hit in November on expectations of lower demand for garments due to the resurgence of new Omicron coronavirus variant, higher supply, and as higher prices are hurting demand for supplies from top shipper US. In the US, cotton production is forecast at 18.3 million bales, up 25 percent from 2020. Also, USDA estimated global production to go up due to better crop yields in Brazil, Australia, and Pakistan. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, cotton production reached over 7.16 million bales, up 54% from a year earlier as of November 30th. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Russia has continued to amass new troops near Ukraine's border in recent days, despite President Joe Biden urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate tensions during a virtual meeting last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , More Russian military units have been sent to the border area in recent days, sources familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. US and Ukrainian officials have also seen evidence that Russia has begun diverting commercial air and rail systems to support the military effort, though similar air and rail activity was visible in the spring during Russia's last military buildup that was ultimately pulled back.                                                                                                                                              , The latest US intelligence assessments place more than 50 so-called "Battalion Tactical Groups" deployed on and around the Ukraine border with six more in transit on the way. These groups, which can typically include as many as 900 personnel each, are highly diversified and fairly self-sufficient combat units with a combination of troops, artillery, anti-tank weapons, reconnaissance and engineering units. BTGs, as they're known, played a leading role in Russian military activity in Ukraine in 2014.                                              , The Biden administration still sees a window to deter a Russian invasion, assessing that Putin has not yet decided whether to launch an attack. But a White House official emphasized to CNN that "we believe talks would be more productive were they to happen in an environment of de-escalation, instead of escalation."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Russia has been demanding security guarantees from the US and NATO, including a binding pledge that NATO won't expand further east and will not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance, according to a draft proposal posted online Friday by Russia's foreign ministry. Russian officials presented Assistant Secretary of State Karen Donfried with the proposals while she was in Moscow this week, which Donfried said she would share with US allies and partners.                                                                                         , But despite an offer to facilitate a meeting with Russia and NATO to discuss Moscow's concerns, Biden has signaled that the US will not make any concessions on either NATO or Ukraine's future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "One nation can't force another nation to change its border; one nation cannot tell another to change its politics; and nations can't tell others who they can work with," Biden told Putin during their meeting, according to a senior White House official.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg echoed that sentiment in a press conference on Thursday. "We believe that dialogue is important especially when times are difficult as they are now," he said. "And our invitation to Moscow to meet in the NATO-Russia Council stands, and we are ready to sit down. But we will never compromise on the right of every sovereign nation, as Ukraine, to choose his own path and of the principle that it is for Ukraine and the 30 Allies to decide when Ukraine is ready to join the Alliance."                           , Recent satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies and provided to CNN show that Russia has massed troops and equipment as close as 30 miles away from Ukraine's border. The images show an increase between September 7 and December 5 in the number of Russian military vehicles in the southwestern Russian city of Soloti. Russia appeared to be setting up a new regiment within its 3rd Motor Rifle Division, an infantry division of Russia's ground forces, according to Michael Kofman, the research program director in the Russia Studies Program at CNA., "The 3rd division is still being set up, as is the 144th," Kofman said. But he noted that the main source of Russia's buildup can be seen more in the movements by Russia's 6th army, the 1st in Voronezh, the 41st in Yelnya, and the 58th and 49th armies in Crimea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who just returned from Ukraine, told reporters earlier this week that the next step to watch in the evolution of the Russian presence near the Ukrainian border is if they call up reserve forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Russia continues to deny that it is putting the pieces in place for an invasion. But Putin has said that Russia has the right to "defend its security" in the face of a potential eastward push by NATO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The Biden administration is still weighing whether to send more weapons and equipment to Ukrainians, following shipments in the last two months of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Command Launch Units, Island Class Patrol Boats, first aid kits, secure radios, electronics, medical equipment, engines, generators, spare parts, as well as small arms and ammunition.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Ukrainian officials have also been pushing for air defense systems, like Patriot surface-to-air missiles, from the US, according to people familiar with their requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has conveyed the US' concerns that such shipments might be viewed by Russia as highly provocative, at a moment when the US, Europe and NATO are trying to get Moscow to de-escalate. Still, the White House has not ruled anything out completely, apart from putting US troops on the ground in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "As we pursue diplomatic channels, we will also prepare for all contingencies," Sullivan told reporters earlier this month. "Just as we have been doing for weeks now, including through the preparation of specific responses to Russian escalation should they be required -- specific, robust, clear responses should they be required."                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Trump administration officials made "deliberate efforts to undermine the nation's coronavirus response for political purposes," the House Select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis led by Democrats said in a report released Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The committee, which spent months working to interview former Trump officials, said the administration worked to undermine the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic by blocking officials from speaking publicly, watering down testing guidance and attempting to interfere with other public health guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Many pieces of the report were a summation of documents and interviews they've released throughout the year, but the report also outlined new examples where health guidance was adapted despite officials' concerns about the potential harmful effects of the changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In one instance, Dr. Jay Butler, the deputy director for infectious diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the committee he was upset and concerned about guidance he was directed to update in May 2020 for faith communities. He said he feared that some of the altered guidance about masking and other church practices could potentially put lives at risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , He wrote in an email about the change that he was "very troubled on this Sunday morning that there will be people who will get sick and perhaps die because of what we were forced to do."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "I was doing a lot of soul searching about whether or not I should have agreed to even make the change in the document," Butler told the committee when asked about his words. "Clearly, it was a directive, but that was a real struggle as I felt like what had been done was not good public health practice."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Butler told the committee that while he wasn't aware of any examples where the guidance had adversely impacted the health of Americans, "that concern will haunt me for some time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The report also chronicled deep frustration from then-White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, who at one point was so upset about a meeting that included doctors whom she called part of a "fringe group" that she told colleagues she would not attend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "I can't be part of this with these people who believe in herd immunity," Birx wrote in an email released by the committee. That approach has been widely decried by public health experts, who note that a previous infection doesn't guarantee immunity and who say such an approach would most certainly have led to even more hospitalizations and deaths. "These are people who believe that all the curves are predetermined and mitigation is irrelevant -- they are a fringe group without grounding in epidemics, public health or on the ground common sense experience. I am happy to go out of town or whatever gives the WH cover," she wrote., The report also laid out how one briefing so angered former President Donald Trump that CDC officials were blocked by the Trump administration for more than three months from conducting public briefings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , One official, then-CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Dr. Nancy Messonnier, told the committee Trump was "angered" after she gave a briefing on February 25, 2020, that warned about the danger of Covid-19. She told the select subcommittee she felt "upset" after she received calls from then-CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield and then-HHS Secretary Alex Azar about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , CNN has reached out to Redfield and Azar for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Another official told the committee the CDC wanted to hold a briefing on the recommendation to wear cloth face masks and inform the public about pediatric cases and deaths from Covid-19 but the Trump administration blocked the request. The committee revealed in its report former CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat said "many of us" in CDC felt they couldn't speak out about the science of Covid-19 because, the report summarized, White House decisions were being driven by politics.                                                                                                                                           , Another example of weakened guidance in the report is from Birx, who confirmed to the committee that Dr. Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, was involved in changing testing guidance to advise against testing most asymptomatic people even if they were exposed to the virus -- something the report said that is contrary to science-based recommendations. Trump brought on Atlas to the coronavirus task force after seeing him appear on Fox.                                                                                                                                                                , CNN has reached out to Atlas for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The committee wrote that Birx stated in her interview that changes made on testing guidance for people who were asymptomatic "were made specifically to reduce the amount of testing being conducted," the report said. Fewer tests served to "obscure how rapidly the virus was spreading across the country," it said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Trump Administration officials engaged in a staggering pattern of political interference in the pandemic response and failed to heed early warnings about the looming crisis," the committee said in its summary. "These decisions placed countless American lives at risk, undermined the nation's public health institutions, and contributed to one of the worst failures of leadership in American history."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , </td>

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also said Friday that it had fined the bank $75 million for allowing unapproved communications since at least 2015.                                                                                                                    , SEC officials who spoke to reporters Thursday evening said JPMorgan's failure to preserve those offline conversations violated federal securities law and left the regulator blind to exchanges between the bank and its clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Federal law requires financial firms to keep meticulous records of electronic messages between brokers and clients so regulators can make sure those firms aren't skirting anti-fraud or antitrust laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The move is the latest sign of an ongoing battle between regulators, banks and employees over the use of personal devices. Policing the use of unofficial channels became even more pressing when most of Wall Street went remote during the coronavirus pandemic. Regulators in New York and London have ratcheted up enforcement of record-keeping rules recently as traders migrated to encrypted messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram., While phone conversations and messages on official company devices and software platforms are preserved, it's much harder for bank compliance departments to surveil communications on third-party apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , That workaround picked up in popularity after two of the industry's biggest trading scandals of the past decade, involving manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange markets, hinged on incriminating messages preserved in chatrooms, resulting in multibillion-dollar fines for banks.                                                                                                                                                                       , Traders at JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and other firms have been dismissed or placed on leave for infractions tied to the practice. But the SEC order revealed how pervasive it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , At JPMorgan, the practice of going offline to communicate was firm-wide, and even the managers and senior personnel responsible for compliance used their personal devices to communicate sensitive business matters, the SEC said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The investigation at JPMorgan is ongoing, and the SEC has launched similar probes at firms across the financial universe. JPMorgan ordered its traders, bankers and financial advisors to preserve work-related messages on personal devices earlier this year, Bloomberg reported in June. Messages included content on a wide range of discussions, including investment strategies, client meetings and market observations, the SEC officials said.         , JPMorgan declined to comment beyond a regulatory disclosure that acknowledged settlements with the two agencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , On top of the fine, JPMorgan agreed to hire a compliance consultant to review the bank's policies and training, the SEC said. The bank had already begun upgrades to employees' software to improve compliance, the SEC said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "As technology changes, it's even more important that registrants ensure that their communications are appropriately recorded and are not conducted outside of official channels in order to avoid market oversight," SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a press release.                                                                                                                                                                                           , In stressing the importance of diligent record-keeping, Gensler recalled the 2013 foreign exchange scandal, when traders at several leading banks used private chat rooms with names including "The Cartel" to conspire to fix currency rates to maximize profits.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Five of the world's largest banks, including JPMorgan, ultimately agreed to pay more than $5 billion in combined penalties and plead guilty to resolve the investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "Books-and-records obligations help the SEC conduct its important examinations and enforcement work," Gensler added.

        +0.96%
       on Friday notified shareholders of a proposed $237.5 million settlement stemming from the two fatal crashes in 2018 of the Boeing 737 MAX. The stockholder derivative action was brought against Boeing's board of directors in a Delaware court in 2019 by plaintiffs Thomas P. DiNapoli, comptroller of New York and the New York State and Local Retirement System and the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado. Under the settlement, Boeing's insurers will make a monetary payment of $237.5 million, minus any attorneys' fees and expenses to Boeing, and Boeing shall implement corporate governance measures.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago wheat futures rose to $7.7 a bushel, rebounding from the 7-week low of $7.56 on December 15th, amid supply concerns among top exporters. After hopes of good farming conditions, unseasonably warm and dry weather in North America threatened US winter crop yield prospects in the Plains bread basket region. At the same time, Moscow could lower the wheat export quota to 8 million tonnes from the previously planned 9 million tonnes, aiding to the downward trend of Russian grain exports. Since the start of the marketing year on July 1st, Russian wheat exports are down 37.5% when compared to last year's. Tight domestic supplies led to continued export tax increases in the last two months, uplifting Chicago wheat futures to 9-year highs and Euronext futures to all-time highs in November. </td>

The Bank of Russia raised its key rate by 100bps to 8.5% on December 17th, but expectations that the policy rate could be close its peak and will ease through 2022 should increase foreign demand of Russian debt instruments. The central bank estimated inflation to be at 8.1% on mid-December, but on track to edge down to 4%-4.5% by the end of 2022. Still, the OFZâs 10-year yield increased by 44% since the start of 2021, underpinned by geopolitical concerns with the West and sanctions from the United States due to military activity on the border with Ukraine. </td>

Afterpay shares have plunged over 30% since the start of the year, while Zip is down 25%. Sezzle's stock price has more than halved in value year-to-date. Affirm, which debuted at the start of the year, is one of the few BNPL firms still in the green., Market players have been alarmed at mounting losses from firms in the sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Zip's pre-tax loss ballooned to 724 million Australian dollars ($518 million) in its 2021 financial year, up from 20.6 million Australian dollars a year earlier.

Christopher Brendler, analyst at D.A.

The central bank said inflation was at 8.1% as of December 13th, but was still on track to return to 4.0-4.5% by the end of 2022. The ruble remains about 6.5% below its 16-month high of 69.3 touched on October 26th on Western concerns over possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine and lower oil prices. </td>

Prices have rallied to record highs underpinned by cold weather, delays in the highly anticipated approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and heightened political tensions in Belarus and eastern Ukraine. Germanyâs federal network agency said Thursday that gas flows to Europe via the newly built pipeline wonât be made before July 2022. Meanwhile, the UK and the EU, together with the US, are close to finalizing a new package of sanctions against Russia, which includes the energy sector, whilst Belarusâ President reiterated threats that it would halt flows through the key Yama-Europe pipeline. With imports running low, investors are now fearing that the ongoing natural gas crunch could be extended into next winter. </td>

US natural gas futures surged to a twelve-year high of $6.466 on October 6th, tracking Asian and European futures, before erasing more than 40% as any concerns about tightness in the US gas market have virtually disappeared following a so-far warm winter heating season, which has dampened domestic demand, while inventories had enough natural gas for the coming winter months. </td>

Meanwhile, Boris Johnsonâs party lost a by-election in the traditionally conservative constituency of North Shropshire, which was held to elect a replacement for the recently resigned conservative MP Owen Paterson. On the data front, UK retail sales rose 1.4% m-o-m in November, beating market expectations of a 0.8% gain and were 7.2% above pre-pandemic levels. For the week, the London-based index is set to erase 0.9%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European Shares Subdued on Friday </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> European stock markets traded lower on Friday, on track to erase last sessionâs gains, weighed down by recurring pandemic and inflation woes. After an initially welcoming reaction to central banksâ monetary policy tightening announcements, concerns were now focused on whether inflation can be brought back to the 2% targets. On the data front, EU car registrations saw their worst November month on records, totalling just over 713 thousand units, as the impact of the global semiconductor chip shortage dragged on. On the pandemic front, the EUâs drugs regulator approved boosting the manufacturing capacity of COVID-19 vaccines, eyeing risks from the omicron variant. On corporate updates, HSBC analysts raised their target price on Lufthansa to â¬5.15 per share (vs â¬4.77 earlier) and Deutsche Post to â¬67 per share (vs â¬65 earlier). On a weekly basis, Frankfurtâs DAX is headed to a 0.3% loss and the pan-European Stoxx 600 eyes a flat ending. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Australian dollar traded below 0.72 against the US dollar on Friday, remaining under pressure as Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe reiterated earlier this week that the central bank would keep interest rates at record low in 2022. The aussie also depreciated against other major currencies including the euro, sterling and yen amid a slew of hawkish turns from their respective central banks. Meanwhile, the aussie was supported by strong jobs data which raised the likelihood that the central bank will wind down its pandemic-era stimulus early next year. The RBA is considering three options for its quantitative easing program ahead of its formal review next year, including ending its bond purchases as soon as February, governor Lowe said in a speech. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The New Zealand dollar remained below 0.68 against the US dollar on Friday, hovering near 13-month lows as a milder than expected economic contraction failed to prop up the currency. New Zealandâs economy shrank 3.7% in the third quarter, well below market expectations for a 4.5% contraction and central bank projection for a 7% decline. The kiwi also depreciated against other major currencies including the euro, sterling and yen amid a slew of hawkish turns from their respective central banks. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% in its last meeting, in line with expectations but fell short of market speculations for a more aggressive 50 bps hike that analysts believed would be more supportive of the currency. Elsewhere, New Zealandâs current account deficit widened to 4.6% of GDP in the third quarter due to strong consumer spending, putting additional pressure on the currency. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.16% to close at 3,632 while the Shenzhen Component Index declined 1.62% to 14,868 on Friday, dragged down by consumer firms amid concerns over a resurgence of Covid cases, while coal miners retreated from recent run ups. Sentiment was also dampened as high-growth tech names sold off globally amid prospects of higher interest rates, with the Fed signaling three rate hikes next year and the BoE surprising markets by raising rates for the first time since the pandemic began. Some notable decliners were Kweichow Moutai (-3.22%), Longi Green Energy (-4.19%), Shanxi Meijin (-3.66%), Wuliangye Yibin (-3.43%), East Money (-2.19%), Shaanxi Coal (-4.67%), Shanxi Xinghuacun (-2.78%) and Luzhou Lao (-3.63%).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Germany's producer prices jumped by 19.2 percent from a year earlier in November 2021, accelerating from an 18.4 percent rise in the previous month and compared with market expectations of 19.9 percent. It was the biggest increase in producer costs since November 1951, mainly due to a surge in energy prices, ongoing supply disruptions and a low base year. Energy cost soared 49.4 percent, driven by natural gas (83.4 percent) and electricity (48.0 percent), while there were also increases in prices of intermediate products (19.1 percent), durable consumer goods (3.7 percent), capital goods (3.6 percent), and non-durable consumer goods (3.7 percent). On monthly basis, producer prices increased by 0.8 percent in November, below forecasts of 1.4 percent. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Retail sales in the UK rose 1.4% mom in November of 2021, above forecasts of 0.8% and were 7.2% higher than their pre-coronavirus February 2020 levels. The main upward contribution came from sales at non-food stores (2%), namely clothing stores (2.9%) and other non-food stores (2.8%) such as computer stores, toy stores and jewellery stores, with retailers noting strong trading related to Black Friday and in the lead up to Christmas. Clothing stores sales volumes in November 2021 were above pre-coronavirus levels for the first time; 3.2% above their level in February 2020. Also, sales of auto fuel increased 3.7% following some disruption to supplies in the previous two months but were still 1.9% below their February 2020 levels; while sales of food went down 0.2%. Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 26.9% in November 2021, its lowest proportion since March 2020 (22.6%) and a continuation of a falling trend since its peak in February 2021 (36.8%). </td>

But, always remember, it&amp;#39;s Jesus, not Santa, the reason for the season.

Holy and small, how many fathers gave up their sons for me? 
Only One did that for me...Is this who we waited for? 
How many gods poured out their hearts to romance a world that tore them apart? 

All for you, all for me. Oh, only Jesus.

Can see on both 1h and 4h chart for VIX that the TTM Squeeze is firing and ready to drop and dump lower

Unless lockdowns announced by UK over the weekend, its likely that market will kill vol early next week into vixperation and then probably spike afterwards. 

TTM Squeeze firing means the price has abnormally lower volatile movement and is getting ready for an outsized volatile movement. The direction usually is aligned with the direction that momentum is headed as well as what ttmsqueeze&amp;#39;s momentum indicator is going. 

I believe this going down as momentum dropping lower. </td>

Can see on both 1h and 4h chart for VIX that the TTM Squeeze is firing and ready to drop and dump lower

Unless lockdowns announced by UK over the weekend, its likely that market will kill vol early next week into vixperation and then probably spike afterwards. 

TTM Squeeze firing means the price has abnormally lower volatile movement and is getting ready for an outsized volatile movement. The direction usually is aligned with the direction that momentum is headed as well as what ttmsqueeze&amp;#39;s momentum indicator is going. 

I believe this going down as momentum dropping lower. </td>

Todayâs challenge trade took only 3 minutes to complete to the goal and we actually exceeded the compounding goal for today. 
 
Initial: $1,000
Current: $4,290 (329%)
Target: $1,000,000 By mid February
Current win rate: 29/30
 
That was just the challenge other trades today yielded well over 100% multiple times as well as closing out puts from yesterday morning with 1,000% return.
 
If you play it smart and remove emotions it will always come easy.

Put some of our teams wins for the last week below, truly inspiring what you can do with a game plan, and knowing exactly how the market will move. Cheers to the weekend and a year of gains to come ð»

Another superb week for banking bears has come and gone.
The BOE &amp;quot;baby rise&amp;quot; of 15 bps was a classic example of a central bank trying to look like they are doing something.
The bond market laughed this token rise off.
Exponential intrest rises are priced in - and simply cant happen without creating carnage.
Banking stocks are very vulnerable now for months to come.
I suggested that shorting banks will buy you a Lambo.

$QQQ  is still holding the whole stock market up.   
 
I think the market will have more kangaroo bounces as everything slowly bleeds out. The reason is because they have to raise interest rates soon in 2022. And that means asset prices have to go down (that includes the stock market).  
 
The truth about used car prices is the prices went up because of INFLATION. Not chip shortages.  
 
The truth about houses is again, INFLATION. There are no shortages of houses , but can you afford the crazy high prices?  
 
The Truth about GOLD prices. INFLATION. Oh wait sorry I meant their is a *shortage of gold.  
 
With all this said, you can  see how the market wont have a sudden huge come back anytime soon. It was only going up due to inflation. </td>

You know what:

If the bears didnât short yesterday and did that today, bears will fail because of premium burning and we will be there at 180.

Bears did that early, next time we need to be prepared for any quad witching .. donât make that kind of options on that week otherwise itâs very brutal.

Thatâs why last Monday .. I noticed the change of vibe so I asked all call options to roll to different date .. less risky.

The result it came no surprise which completely wiped out this week calls.

Lesson learned .. be careful .. ! </td>

Imagine if America ðºð¸ loses talents like @elonmusk to China ð¨ð³ or Russia ð·ðº how bad of consequences this country will have !! 

The fact that this Administration is on active attack campaign against America top talents and one of the smartest innovators of our time  is very troubling and raises many questions about the integrity and the intention of such attackers and what good  would it do for  America ! ? 

Look around seriously and see what these ppl have done -  career politicians lie about everything yet attacking America strongest assets .  instead of Cherish them protect them and help them out in implementing their vision to advance this country forward!! 

This is very serious â¦ as serious as someone working against US best interest !!

1) have a site to monitor weekly OI and daily volume. Free site is max-pain.com but more detail found in option trading platforms and paid subscription sites.
2) max pain/weekly OI only is something to superficial factor early in week and really start to factor later in the week. 
3) early in the week big moves have much more built in time premium and so if you want safer plays those days you target way out the money &amp;quot;lottos&amp;quot; like the 910s and 890s puts i targeted mon/tues. When wrong limited loss and when right often easy to capture 200-400% moves but should close out with any such move as likelihood print small. 
4) dont chase the runs if you missed them especially early week. You are paying absurd premiums and likelihood burned at very expensive rare exponentially higher. 
5) knowing in a option manipulated stock always watch where daily call and put volume lines up. If volume lands big in area can probably expect a reversal those pts

Omicron is on the rise, and the U.S.âs largest cities are getting slammed with it.

New York City just reported its highest-ever number of Covid-19 cases at more than 21,000. The rate of Covid-positive tests also doubled to about 8% in the city in just a matter of days. According to the CDC, 13% of all Covid cases reported last week were Omicron infections.

William Lee is the VP of Science at a population-genomics company and shared that âItâs growing so much faster as a proportion of cases than any of the previous variants of concern did.â Lee also guessed the Omicron would be the dominant U.S. variant within a week.

Covid-related hospitalizations have increased 4% this week, with deaths up 8% week-over-week. Broadway shows, professional sporting events, and other gatherings have been postponed in response. Thatâs concerning for the recovery narrative, which was strong until Omicron started its world tour.

We have been listening for weeks about this gap, it had to be closed. And it was an important BEARISH argument. 

Now the gap was closed and nobody is spamming every minute about this. But it must be actually just as bullish as it was bearish before it was closed, no?
