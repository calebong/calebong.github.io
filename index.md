But workers will still have to be vaccinated if they plan to use the company’s offices.                                                                                       , In an email to San Francisco Bay Area employees last week, Google said it was easing some of its pandemic restrictions. It will no longer require employees to be tested weekly to enter its U.S. offices. Also, it will not require staff to wear masks in the office, with the exception of Santa Clara County — home to Google’s main Mountain View headquarters., Google also said it planned to restore many of its famed office amenities, such as fitness centers, cafeterias, massage services and commuter shuttles. CNBC reported the change in policies earlier.                                                                                                                                                               , “Based on current conditions in the Bay Area, we’re pleased that our employees who choose to come in now have the ability to access more on-site spaces and services,” Google wrote in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                 , Separately, the company has dropped its requirement that U.S. employees provide evidence of vaccination status or apply for a medical or religious exemption, Lora Lee Erickson, a Google spokeswoman, said.                                                                                                                                                        , Last year, Google said employees who failed to do so would be placed on administrative leave and could be fired eventually. Ms. Erickson did not explain why the company had changed its position.                                                                                                                                                                  , Like many companies, Google has had to adapt its policies to the frequently changing conditions of the pandemic. It has repeatedly pushed back plans for when it will ask employees to start working on a hybrid schedule that mixes remote work and in-office time.                                                                                                , Google’s offices are a key component to its work culture, and the company has resisted going fully remote like other technology companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Instead of a global mandate, Google has repeatedly said it will allow different regions to determine when to start requiring workers to come in a few times a week. In the United States, Google said, it is still assessing the right time to begin its hybrid work schedule and hasn’t set a date for workers to return to the office.                            , While returning to the office is still voluntary, Google said about 30 percent of its Bay Area employees came into the office last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Advertisement </td>

Or, as the majority did with a collective amnesia on the January 6 insurrection, will they retreat on promised sanctions and support for Ukraine?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The GOP, already changed by Trump, may be molting again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The old party. Republicans used to stand up to Russia. During the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan demanded that Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev "tear down this wall" in Berlin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , They used to oppose unwarranted invasions. In 1990, George H.W. Bush said to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that his aggression against Kuwait "will not stand."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , They used to recognize that even modern Russia is a threat to the US. Mitt Romney -- who became the Republican presidential nominee in the 2012 race against President Barack Obama -- said that year that Russia was the United States' main geopolitical foe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A new tone. The party today is under the influence of Trump, who heaped admiration on Putin for invading another country with a democratically elected leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius.'

Oh, that's wonderful," Trump said on Tuesday in an interview on "The Clay Travis &amp; Buck Sexton Show," a conservative radio show.                                                                                                                                                                                    , He then suggested it would be nice to have a "peace force" like the Russian military to be stationed on the US border with Mexico -- a supremely flawed comparison since Trump wants to secure the border, whereas Putin appears to be set on claiming new territory. Putin has misleadingly referred to Russian forces he ordered to enter eastern Ukraine as "peacekeepers."                                                                                                                       , Holdouts. It was Republicans like Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the few seeking accountability for the Capitol Hill insurrection, who openly criticized Trump's praise of Putin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Others' praise for Putin. Before the Ukraine invasion, there were already echoes of Trump's high regard for Putin among Republicans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called Putin "a very talented statesman" who has "lots of gifts" in a Fox interview. The Kansas City Star wrote in detail about Pompeo's comments regarding Putin and Ukraine over the years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Disinterest in other democracies. After the invasion of Ukraine began, there was a lot of disinterest from conservative voices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "As an American, what's in this for me and my neighbors and the rest of us? And all I'm getting is that we can feel morally satisfied because we hate Putin," Tucker Carlson said on Fox on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , J.D. Vance, an author and Trump acolyte running for Senate in Ohio, has pushed an almost isolationist view of foreign policy, arguing the US has no real interest in Russia's incursion into Ukraine and should instead be focused solely on the Southern border.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "'America First' means not listening to the same people who have blundered us into disaster after disaster on the world stage," Vance said on Twitter on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Coincidental alignment. Even Republicans who talk about the need to support Ukraine have suggested the US might reject out of hand, as Putin desires, admitting Ukraine into NATO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Sen. Josh Hawley, the fist-pumping Missourian who helped question the US presidential election results, recently wrote a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioning the wisdom of even entertaining the idea of adding Ukraine to NATO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , It just so happens that Putin's main goal of halting the expansion of NATO is exactly in line with Hawley's letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , An authoritarian and a wannabe authoritarian. Trump's reverence of Putin is well documented, as are Putin's efforts to meddle in recent US presidential elections with an eye toward helping Trump's chances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Putin has won elections with unbelievable support. Trump is still won't believe he lost the 2020 election. Both men may be running again in 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In fact, their interests have often dovetailed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Putin wants to beat NATO back to its Cold War membership and undermine European unity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Trump groused about NATO throughout his presidency, and frequently misrepresented NATO's requirement that member nations spend 2% of their GDP on defense.

That's not to say Trump's Putin envy is universal in the GOP.

Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN in a statement on Wednesday, referring to Biden's efforts to sanction the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. Risch would have preferred Biden to be more forceful on the pipeline earlier. "The next step is to work with Germany to ensure this geopolitical threat remains dead, never to be resurrected," he said., Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also offered rare praise for Biden for the sanctions, but he has also recently accused Biden of weakness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The McConnell example. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, while accusing Biden of foreign policy weakness, has also promised to stand up to Russia alongside the Democrats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , McConnell argues Putin built up troops on the Ukraine border only after Biden withdrew the US from Afghanistan. Never mind that Biden was largely following the example of Trump on that particular issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Many Americans don't care about Russia and Ukraine. Disinterest in maintaining international democracies is common in the US.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A new AP-NORC poll, released Wednesday and conducted as the Ukraine standoff grew more tense, suggests about half of Americans think the US should play only a minor role in the situation. Almost a third of independents and about a fifth of Republicans think the US should play no role at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Nationalist Russia. One explanation for why Republicans are less concerned with Russia, in addition to signaling from Trump, may be ideological. In the AP-NORC poll, Republicans are far more concerned than other subgroups about a direct threat from China, which is still a Communist country, than from Russia, which is not.                                                                                                                                                                  , Republican attacks on Democrats for veering toward socialism have now lasted much longer than the Soviet Union. Russia, under Putin, is a nationalist regime. And in that could lie much of what Trump, who pushed American nationalism as US President, covets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday evening after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its lowest level of the year amid escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine.                                                                                                         , Dow futures rose 0.08%, while futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 were unchanged and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.01%.                                                                                                                                                                                        , In the regular trading session, the Dow dropped about 464 points, or 1.3%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8%, moving deeper into correction and ending the day about 12% from its Jan. 3 record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 2.6%.                                                               , Investors continued to assess the potential outcome of the situation in Ukraine and what it could mean for markets, as the country warned its citizens in Russia to leave. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it will impose additional sanctions against Russia, and the U.K. said it's ready to do the same., However, some are beginning to shrug off Ukraine-related anxieties, noting that it's not alone in contributing to the current market pulldown and won't be the cause of much, if any, longer-term damage.                                                                                           , "So far, it looks like Ukraine is not the reason for the drop, despite the fears," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.

Specifically, it could keep inflation higher than it might have been otherwise.                     , "Market volatility is normal, but the truth is that the decline we have seen so far is much less than might have been expected," McMillan said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Shares of Allbirds Inc. 
        birds
       fell around 4% in the extended session Wednesday after the footwear and apparel maker beat fourth-quarter  expectations but called for slightly lower sales in the current quarter. Allbirds said it lost $10.4 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $9.4 million, or 18 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales rose 23% to $97.2 million, thanks to "strong" U.S. demand during the holidays and the company's "strongest" new-product line-up for the year, Allbirds said. FactSet consensus called for losses of 9 cents a share on revenue of $92 million. Fourth-quarter revenue was the company's largest on record, co-founder and Chief Executive Joey Zwillinger said in a statement. "Our results reflect strong global demand for the Allbirds brand and best-in-class execution by our teams during a period of ongoing macro challenges." Allbirds guided for full-year 2022 revenue between $355 million and $365 million, which would represent growth between 28% and 32% as compared with fiscal 2021. For the first quarter, it called for revenue between $60 million and $62 million, which would represent growth between 21% and 25% as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The analysts surveyed by FactSet expect first-quarter revenue of about $64 million., The World Health Organization said the BA.2 subvariant of the omicron strain of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 appears to be more transmissible than the original omicron, but is not stopping overall case tallies from declining globally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sunak says he 'firmly believes in lower taxes' despite April increase </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chancellor Rishi Sunak will pledge to "deliver a low tax, higher growth economy" amid criticism from MPs over rises to National Insurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Mr Sunak will tell an audience at the Bayes Business School on Thursday that he will cut taxes "sustainably".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , It comes as National Insurance rates are set to rise from 1 April to help fund health and social care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The rise means employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "I am going to deliver a lower tax economy but I am going to do so in a responsible way, and in a way that tackles our long term challenges," Mr Sunak will say in his speech.                                                                                                                                                                       , "I firmly believe in lower taxes."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , However, the chancellor will also argue that taxes should not be cut if spending plans are unfunded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Conservative Party was "now the party of high tax".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "The chancellor may say he 'believes' in low taxes in his lecture - but the hard facts are that Sunak has hit households and business with 15 tax rises in two years in post - with an unfair National Insurance rise down the line - and he has raised the most tax on average per budget than any Chancellor in the last 50 years," Ms Reeves said., Her comments come as Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer is to deliver a speech in Huddersfield outlining how his party would help "put money back in people's pockets" and end insecure employment.                                                                                                                                                , Mr Sunak will say he is "disheartened when I hear the flippant claim that 'tax cuts always pay for themselves'".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "They do not," he will add. "Cutting tax sustainably requires hard work, prioritisation, and the willingness to make difficult and often unpopular arguments elsewhere."

Covid-related government spending through furlough payments, business grants and testing.

                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Under the government's plans, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April for a year.                                                                                                                                                                                          , After that, the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy.

                                  , The Liberal Democrats and some backbench Tory MPs have called for the chancellor to scrap the incoming NI hike to ease the financial burden on households and businesses at a time of rising costs.                                                                                                                                                  , In the speech Mr Sunak will also set out his priorities to increase the UK's economic growth, and will argue that "what government does is far less important than creating the conditions for private businesses and individuals to thrive".                                                                                                        , Tony Danker, director general of the business group the CBI, said setting out how firms could "achieve sustainable growth for the long term" was "vital" at a period of volatility in the economy.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr Danker has called for a permanent "super-deduction" tax break to boost business investment in the UK.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, closed 0.8% lower at 112,008 on Wednesday, amid mounting concerns over geopolitical tensions. Investors continued to assess the impact of the first tranche of sanctions on Russia while Ukraine suffered another broad cyberattack and introduced a state of emergency. Meanwhile, Brazil's inflation in the month to mid-February rose more than expected to the highest for that month in six years, indicating persistent inflationary pressures and reinforcing the trend of rising interest rates. On the earnings front, Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau reported a 237% jump in fourth-quarter net profit to 3.56 billion reais, but below market forecasts of 3.7 billion reais. Among others, Petrobras will also divulge corporate results after the close.

        NDLS,
        -5.43%
       fell more than 20% in the extended session Wednesday after the restaurant chain reported a surprise quarterly loss and revenues that missed expectations, saying it faced staffing shortages and other challenges related to a COVID-19 surge late last year. Noodles &amp; Co. said it lost $4.7 million, or 10 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $3.8 million, or 9 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, the company lost 5 cents a share. Revenue rose 7.1% to $114.8 million, the company said. FactSet consensus called for earnings of 8 cents a share on sales of $121 million. "While underlying business fundamentals remained strong, fourth-quarter results were impacted by staffing challenges" as well as a surge in COVID-19 cases in the areas where most of its operations are, the upper Midwest and the Rocky Mountain region, in November and into early December, Noodles &amp; Co. said. The company estimated that the temporary closures and fewer operating hours impacted its revenue by about $8 million. "We do expect near-term pressures in the first quarter due to the omicron variant, as well as during the first half of the year due to commodity inflation, but we are confident we will successfully navigate this environment," the company said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The American Petroleum Institute reported late Wednesday that U.S. crude supplies rose by about 6 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 18, according to sources. The API, which released its data a day later than usual due to Monday's Presidents' Day holiday, also reportedly showed a weekly inventory increase of 427,000 barrels for gasoline, while distillate stockpiles declined by 985,000 barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., delivery were down by 2.1 million barrels last week, sources said. Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Thursday. On average, the EIA is expected to show crude inventories down by 300,000 barrels, according to a survey of analysts conducted by S&amp;P Global Platts. The survey also calls for weekly supply declines of 1.1 million barrels each for gasoline and distillates. Oil prices held their ground in the electronic trading session after the API data.

        +3.36%
       fell more than 14% in the extended session Wednesday after the mattress and bedding manufacturer missed fourth-quarter expectations and said the late arrival of semiconductor parts from an undisclosed large supplier in December caused it to miss out on millions of dollars' worth of sales. Sleep Number said it earned $11.1 million, or 47 cents a share, in the quarter, compared to $2.19 a share in the year-ago period. Sales fell 13% to $492 million, with the late arrival of chips constraining its delivered net sales by more than $125 million, or about two and half weeks of deliveries, the company said. FactSet consensus called for earnings of $1.59 a share on sales of $601 million. "The fourth quarter proved to be the most challenging as we received semiconductor components too late in December (to fulfill) our planned deliveries," Chief Executive Shelly Ibach said in a statement. "Global electronics supplies remain constrained in the near-term," while demand for its beds remains "strong." Sleep Number guided for its full-year 2022 EPS to increase between 10% and 15% as compared with 2021, an outlook that assumes "continued global electronics supply constraints with the greatest impact expected in the first quarter." Shares of Sleep Number ended the regular trading day up 3.4%. , Shares of Home Depot Inc. undefined tumbled 9.8% in afternoon trading Tuesday, to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's decliners, after the home improvement retailer reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat expectations and raised its dividend, but reported gross margin that fell and provided a less than enthusiastic profit outlook. The stock's price decline of $33.84 was shaving about 223 points off the Dow's price, representing about 38% of the Dow's decline of 580 points, or 1.7%. The stock was headed for the biggest percentage decline since dropped 10.4% on March 18, 2020. Meanwhile, shares of Home Depot rival Lowe's Companies undefined, which reports fiscal fourth-quarter results before Wednesday's open, dropped 4.4% in afternoon trading Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Stocks Sink, Dow Ends at 11-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wall Street went into a tailspin on Wednesday, with investors nervous about the Ukraine crisis and the consequences of Western sanctions against Russia on growth and inflation. After an initial round of sanctions on Moscow, US President Biden announced new penalties hitting the builder of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. US intelligence warned Ukraine of full-scale Russian invasion within 48 hours while several countries including the EU, the UK, Canada, Australia and Japan also imposed restrictions on Russian companies, individuals and financial markets. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s parliament approved a declaration of a state of emergency in the entire country and told its citizens in Russia to immediately come home, while Moscow began evacuating its Kyiv embassy. The Dow Jones lost more than 460 points to close at its lowest level in about 11 months; the S&amp;P 500 declined 1.8%, extending losses for the 4th day and falling deeper into correction territory; and the heavyweight Nasdaq shed 2.6%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The two prosecutors leading the Manhattan district attorney's investigation into former President Donald Trump and his business practices abruptly resigned on Wednesday, the New York Times reported. The resignations came amid a month-long pause in their presentation of evidence to a grand jury, and throw the future of the inquiry into serious doubt, said the Times, which cited people described as having knowledge of the matter. The report said prosecutors Carey R. Dunne and Mark F. Pomerantz submitted their resignations after the new Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, indicated to them that he had doubts about moving forward with a case against Trump.   , The New York Times probes Ginni Thomas's role to keep Trump as president, reinvigorating social media calls for an investigation of Justice Clarence Thomas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Robert Schroeder is the Washington bureau chief for MarketWatch.

It is also the world’s largest wheat exporter, and is a major food supplier to Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The United States imports relatively little directly from Russia, but a commodities crunch caused by a conflict could have knock-on effects that at least temporarily drive up prices for raw materials and finished goods when much of the world, including the United States, is experiencing rapid inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Global unrest could also spook American consumers, prompting them to cut back on spending and other economic activity. If the slowdown were to become severe, it could make it harder for the Federal Reserve, which is planning to raise interest rates in March, to decide how quickly and how aggressively to increase borrowing costs. Central bankers noted in minutes from their most recent meeting that geopolitical risks “could cause increases in global energy prices or exacerbate global supply shortages,” but also that they were a risk to the outlook for growth.            , The magnitude of the potential economic fallout is unclear, because the scope and scale of the conflict remain anything but certain. But a foreign conflict could further delay a return to normalcy after two years in which the coronavirus pandemic has buffeted both the global and U.S. economies. Tension between Russia and Ukraine is escalating when American consumers are already contending with quickly rising prices, businesses are trying to navigate roiled supply chains and people report feeling pessimistic about their financial outlooks despite strong economic growth., “The level of economic uncertainty is going to rise, which is going to be negative for households and firms,” said Maurice Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He noted that the effect would be felt most acutely in Europe and to a lesser degree in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , A major and immediate economic implication of a showdown in Eastern Europe ties back to oil and gas. Russia produces 10 million barrels of oil a day, roughly 10 percent of global demand, and is Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas, which is used to fuel power plants and provide heat to homes and businesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The United States imports comparatively little Russian oil, but energy commodity markets are global, meaning a change in prices in one part of the world influences how much people pay for energy elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , It is unclear how much a conflict would push up prices, but energy markets have already been jittery — and fuel prices have risen sharply — on the prospect of an invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , If oil increases to $120 per barrel by the end of February, past the $95 mark it hovered around last week, inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index could climb close to 9 percent in the next couple months, instead of a currently projected peak of a little below 8 percent, said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS who formerly led the prices and wages section at the Fed.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “It becomes a question of: How long do oil prices, natural gas wholesale prices stay elevated?” he said. “That’s anybody’s guess.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The $120-a-barrel mark for oil is a reasonable estimate of how high prices could go, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. That would translate to roughly $4 per gallon at the pump on average, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , It might be difficult to determine how much of the change in energy prices is attributable to the budding conflict. Omair Sharif at Inflation Insights noted that oil and gas prices had already been going up this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “I don’t know when you want to start the clock on Ukraine becoming a major headline,” Mr. Sharif said. Plus, from an American inflation perspective, how much the conflict matters “all depends on how much the United States gets involved.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Oil may be the major story when it comes to the inflationary effects of a Russian conflict, but it is not the only one. Ukraine is also a significant producer of uranium, titanium, iron ore, steel and ammonia, and a major source of Europe’s arable land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Christian Bogmans, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, said a conflict in Ukraine could further inflate global food prices, which were set to stabilize after skyrocketing last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Russia and Ukraine together are responsible for nearly 30 percent of global wheat exports, while Ukraine alone accounts for more than 15 percent of global corn exports, he said. And many of Ukraine’s growing regions for wheat and corn are near the Russian border.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The rising price of gas and fertilizer, as well as droughts and adverse weather in some regions, like the Dakotas, had already helped to push up the global price of wheat and other commodities. Ukraine is also a significant producer of barley and vegetable oil, which goes into many packaged foods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “In case of a conflict, production might be interrupted, and shipping may be affected as well,” Mr. Bogmans said. If other countries impose sanctions on Russian food items, that could further limit global supplies and inflate prices, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But because food costs make up a small portion of inflation, that may not matter as much to overall price data, Mr. Detmeister at UBS said. It is also hard to guess exactly how import prices would shape up because of the potential for currency movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A rising concern. A Russian attack on Ukraine could cause dizzying spikes in energy and food prices and spook investors. The economic damage from supply disruptions and economic sanctions would be severe in some countries and industries and unnoticed in others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The cost of energy. Oil prices already are the highest since 2014, and they have risen as the conflict has escalated. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, providing roughly one of every 10 barrels the global economy consumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders have accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of reducing supplies to gain a political edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat and, together with Ukraine, accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports. In countries like Egypt and Turkey, that flow of grain makes up more than 70 percent of wheat imports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets.

That could pose a challenge for industries that move products by air, like electronics, fast fashion and even automakers, he said at an event at the National Press Foundation on Feb. 9.                                                                                                                                                                                         , “Air has been a means of getting around supply chain problems,” Mr. Levy said. “If your factory was going to shut because you don’t have a key part, you might fly in that key part.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Some companies may not yet realize their true exposure to a potential crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Victor Meyer, the chief operating officer of Supply Wisdom, which helps companies analyze their supply chains for risk, said some companies were surprised by the extent of their exposure to the region during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, when it annexed Crimea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr. Meyer noted that if he were a chief security officer of a company with ties to Ukraine, “I would militate rather strongly to unwind my exposure.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , There could also be other indirect effects on the economy, including rattling consumer confidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Households are sitting on cash stockpiles and probably could afford higher prices at the pump, but climbing energy costs are likely to make consumers unhappy when prices overall are already climbing and economic sentiment has swooned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “The hit would be easily absorbed, but it would make consumers even more miserable, and we have to assume that a war in Europe would depress confidence directly, too,” Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a Feb. 15 note.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Another risk to American economic activity may be underrated, Mr. Obstfeld said: the threat of cyberattack.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> U.S. oil futures logged a modest gain on Wednesday as traders continued to monitor the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. "An immediate run towards $100 oil is still in the cards, but the rising prospects that an Iran nuclear deal could be reached in the coming days may tentatively delay" a move above that price level, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. For now, U.S. benchmark crude prices should remain around the low $90s "until a major update with Iran nuclear deal talks or if the new Cold War leads to military conflict," he said.

The selloff put the stock on track to open at the lowest price seen during regular-session hours since September 2019. The company said its KSI-301 showed "strong durability," and was safe and well tolerated, but it did not meet the primary endpoint of showing "non-inferior visual acuity gains" for those dosed on extended regimens compared with aflibercept given every eight weeks.

Economists estimated that sanctions imposed by Western nations cost Russia $50 billion a year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Since then, the global market for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets has ballooned. That’s bad news for enforcers of sanctions, and good news for Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , On Tuesday, the Biden administration enacted fresh sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine, aiming to thwart its access to foreign capital. But Russian entities are preparing to blunt some of the worst effects by making deals with anyone around the world willing to work with them, experts said. And, they say, those entities can then use digital currencies to bypass the control points that governments rely on — mainly transfers of money by banks — to block deal execution.                                                                                                                             , “Russia has had a lot of time to think about this specific consequence,” said Michael Parker, a former federal prosecutor who now heads the anti-money laundering and sanctions practice at the Washington law firm Ferrari &amp; Associates. “It would be naïve to think that they haven’t gamed out exactly this scenario.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Sanctions are some of the most powerful tools the United States and European countries have to influence the behavior of nations they don’t consider allies. The United States in particular is able to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool because the dollar is the world’s reserve currency and used in payments worldwide. But American government officials are increasingly aware of the potential for cryptocurrencies to lessen the impact of sanctions and are stepping up their scrutiny of digital assets.                                                                                                             , To apply sanctions, a government makes a list of people and businesses its citizens must avoid. Anyone caught engaging with a member of the list faces heavy fines. But the real key to any effective sanctions program is the global financial system. Banks around the world play a major role in enforcement: They see where money comes from and where it’s bound, and anti-money laundering laws require them to block transactions with sanctioned entities and report what they see to authorities. But if banks are the eyes and ears of governments in this space, the explosion of digital currencies is blinding them., Banks have to abide by “know your customer” rules, which include verifying their clients’ identities. But exchanges and other platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies and digital assets are rarely as good at tracking their customers as banks are, even though they are supposed to follow the same rules. In October, the U.S. Treasury Department warned that cryptocurrencies posed an increasingly serious threat to the American sanctions program and that U.S. authorities needed to educate themselves about the technology.                                                             , Should it choose to evade sanctions, Russia has multiple cryptocurrency-related tools at its disposal, experts said. All it needs is to find ways to trade without touching the dollar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The Russian government is developing its own central bank digital currency, a so-called digital ruble that it hopes to use to trade directly with other countries willing to accept it without first converting it into dollars. Hacking techniques like ransomware could help Russian actors steal digital currencies and make up revenue lost to sanctions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , And while cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on the underlying blockchain, making them transparent, new tools developed in Russia can help mask the origin of such transactions. That would allow businesses to trade with Russian entities without detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , There is a precedent for these kinds of workarounds. Iran and North Korea are among countries that have used digital currencies to mitigate the effects of Western sanctions, a trend that U.S. and United Nations officials have recently observed. North Korea, for instance, has used ransomware to steal cryptocurrency to fund its nuclear program, according to a U.N. report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In October 2020, representatives of Russia’s central bank told a Moscow newspaper that the new “digital ruble” would make the country less dependent on the United States and better able to resist sanctions. It would let Russian entities conduct transactions outside the international banking system with any country willing to trade in digital currency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Russia could find willing partners in other nations targeted by U.S. sanctions, including Iran, that are also developing government-backed digital currencies. China, Russia’s largest trading partner in both imports and exports according to the World Bank, has already launched its own central bank digital currency. The country’s leader, Xi Jinping, recently described China’s relationship with Russia as having “no limits.”                                                                                                                                                                                         , The developing system of central banks directly exchanging digital currencies creates new risks, said Yaya Fanusie, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who has studied the effects of cryptocurrency on sanctions. “The lessening of U.S. sanctions power comes from a system where these nation states are able to do transactions without going through the global banking system.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In early February, independent sanctions monitors told the United Nations Security Council that North Korea was using cryptocurrencies to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile program, according to Reuters. (A spokesman for Norway’s permanent mission to the U.N. confirmed the existence of the report, which has not yet been made public.) Last May, the consulting firm Elliptic described how Iran was using revenue from Bitcoin mining to make up for the limitations on its ability to sell oil because of sanctions.                                                                                              , Sanctioned Russian entities could deploy their own evasion strategy, using ransomware attacks. The playbook is straightforward: A hacker breaks into computer networks and locks up digital information until the victim pays for its release, usually in cryptocurrency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A rising concern. A Russian attack on Ukraine could cause dizzying spikes in energy and food prices and spook investors. The economic damage from supply disruptions and economic sanctions would be severe in some countries and industries and unnoticed in others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The cost of energy. Oil prices already are the highest since 2014, and they have risen as the conflict has escalated. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, providing roughly one of every 10 barrels the global economy consumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders have accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of reducing supplies to gain a political edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat and, together with Ukraine, accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports. In countries like Egypt and Turkey, that flow of grain makes up more than 70 percent of wheat imports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions designed to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Russia is at the center of the growing ransomware industry. Last year, about 74 percent of global ransomware revenue, or more than $400 million worth of cryptocurrency, went to entities that are probably affiliated with Russia in some way, according to a Feb. 14 report by the blockchain-tracking firm Chainalysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Illegal funds have also flowed into Russia through a dark web marketplace called Hydra, which is powered by cryptocurrency and handled more than $1 billion in sales in 2020, according to Chainalysis. The platform’s strict rules — sellers are allowed to liquidate cryptocurrency only through certain regional exchanges — have made it difficult for researchers to follow the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “We know that there’s no questions asked, and we know that Hydra operates not just throughout Eastern Europe but throughout western Europe,” said Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis. “There’s definitely cross-border business happening.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Digital currencies all use blockchain technology, a form of computer code that is publicly viewable by anyone, anywhere. This public ledger keeps track of the movements of individual digital coins from one “wallet” — as online repositories for digital assets are called — to another. In theory, this should let authorities track all crypto transactions and keep sanctioned entities from completing them.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , But the technology behind Hydra masks the source of transactions, offering a potential tool for Russian users to move money outside the country’s borders. On its own, Hydra is not yet big enough to handle the volume of transactions that Russia would need to successfully evade sanctions. But other money-laundering techniques — including “nesting,” in which an illicit marketplace buries itself within a larger, legitimate structure to hide its activities — could also help.                                                                                                                                       , There are signs that the United States is stepping up its monitoring of cryptocurrency activity. On Feb. 17, the Justice Department announced it had created a new national cryptocurrency enforcement team, a move that seemed to emphasize that federal prosecutors were paying extra attention to bad behavior among cryptocurrency users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Parker, the former prosecutor, said that the Feb. 8 arrests of a Manhattan couple for stealing $3.6 billion in Bitcoin from the Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is “a tangible example of the government getting very good and up to speed on what they need to do to be able to trace this.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Administration officials are also urging the cryptocurrency industry to implement internal controls that prevent bad actors from using their services. In October, the Treasury Department published a 30-page sanctions-compliance manual recommending that cryptocurrency companies use geolocation tools to weed out customers in sanctioned jurisdictions. In many cases, the report said, crypto companies have taken months or years to implement such compliance procedures.                                                                                                                                              , That may change as the industry starts to mature. Chainalysis offers a “know your transaction” tool that alerts companies when blacklisted entities use their services. Last year, the company doubled its number of private-sector customers, many of whom use the compliance tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But savvy cryptocurrency users can find ways around a blacklist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “A Treasury designation of a crypto wallet address is not foolproof,” said Mr. Fanusie of the Center for a New American Security. “That designated actor can still open up a new wallet elsewhere. You can do that quite easily.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan argues geopolitical events and the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb soaring inflation are contributing to the recent turbulence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan argued on Wednesday that geopolitical events and supply chain issues are creating "additional uncertainty" as market volatility rages on, but notes that overall the U.S. economy is strong based on consumer spending, low unemployment and wage growth.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Moynihan provided the insight on "Cavuto: Coast to Coast" on Tuesday, stressing the importance of getting inflation under control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The consumer price index rose 7.5% in January from a year ago, according to a new Labor Department report released earlier this month, marking the fastest increase since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.6%. The CPI – which measures a bevy of goods ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents – jumped 0.6% in the one-month period from December.                                                                                                            , The Federal Reserve late last month signaled it could "soon" raise interest rates for the first time in three years, paving the way for a March liftoff as policymakers seek to keep prices under control and combat the hottest inflation in nearly four decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Moynihan stressed that, overall, "we feel good about the U.S. economy" based on "what we see on the consumer base and spending," as well as with the bank’s corporate customers, borrowing, and credit availability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "Everything is very strong," he continued. "The capitalization of banks [and] liquidity of banks."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Moynihan argued that the banking sector "is in great shape to support the real economy" and that we will see it grow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Unemployment is low, wages are growing," he added. "Things like that are good. It’s just that we have to get inflation under control at the same time."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Moynihan made the comments as U.S. stocks gave up early gains on Wednesday as investors are monitoring the situation between Russia and Ukraine and amid reports Ukraine was the target of a massive cyber attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The S&amp;P 500 fell .3%, after falling into correction territory Tuesday, down over 10% from its most recent peak.

The Fed kept rates ultra-low for years following the 2008 financial crisis, only raising them once at the end of 2015. Officials subsequently raised rates eight more times over a three-year period. , Although central bank officials have left rates unchanged since March 2020, they indicated broad support during their two-day January meeting to begin raising rates amid growing concern over the rapid increase in consumer prices. A rate increase would mark the first since December 2018.

liftoff, they hinted it could take place during their meeting on March 15-16.

last month Bank of America economists noted that they expect the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at every meeting for the remainder of the year as central bank policymakers look to tackle inflation.

rate increases in 2022, putting the target range between 2.75% and 3% at year's end.

              , "So the idea that the Fed would move faster than people thought doesn’t surprise me at all, and I think they know they need to," he continued, noting that COVID-19 could put a dent in those plans given "the pandemic path is always unpredictable."

uncertainty,' but notes that overall the U.S. economy is strong based on consumer spending, low unemployment and wage growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , He also noted that geopolitical events would impact the Fed’s moves considering those events could also be unpredictable, stressing that "inflation is not temporary and "has to be dealt with."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "And I think moving rates up will deal with it and I think you will see them [the Fed] move relatively quickly," he continued.

that "the market gets ahead of them," pointing to the recent surge in treasury yields.

discounts the future and moves up," Moynihan said.

coming through the market even before they [the Fed] actually take action," he continued. "They know what they need to do. They have tools to fight inflation. They have to apply and they have to be careful not to over-apply because that causes a recession on the other side."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The market has adjusted its views of how the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates next month and not slow down until well into 2023, though the slope of the increases might be a bit gentler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Events over the past week, including statements from multiple Fed officials and, to a lesser extent, geopolitical turmoil, have convinced markets that the first rate move will be just a quarter percentage point.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , That change came after traders had been pricing a move double that size at the March 15-16 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Central bankers have been dousing the idea of needing to go up 50 basis points at the meeting, with New York Fed President John Williams saying last week that the case was "no compelling argument" for the move.                                                                       , Still, it hasn't made investors any less nervous about what the path ahead will look like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "I'm not so worried about whether they do 50 [basis] points out of the gate or not. But I also think they shouldn't overdo it here," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. "You can do 25, and if you want to do another one soon, you can do it, rather than add additional disruption or uncertainty."                                                                                    , Indeed, markets have been volatile in 2022 as inflation has run rampant and pushed the Fed into a position where it is essentially being forced to tighten policy. Consumer prices are up 7.5% over the past year, well ahead of the 2% level that the Fed considers healthy for inflation.                                                                                                                                , Markets have been playing a guessing game this year, trying to figure out just how far the Fed will go. Current expectations are a certainty for a March increase and a slightly better than 50% probability that the Fed will enact seven hikes this year, which would translate into a raise at each of its remaining meetings, according to CME Group data.                                                             , The Russia-Ukraine conflict has added another wrinkle for the Fed. Prices for some commodities such as energy and grains have surged higher as the prospect of a full-blown Russian invasion has intensified. Fed officials will have to weigh the merits of hiking rates to fight inflation against any potential economic slowdown the matter could cause.                                                               , However, Paulsen and others say they don't think the situation factors much into Fed thinking, and most economists expect rate hikes to proceed as anticipated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Late last week, for instance, JPMorgan Chase chief economist Bruce Kasman said he expects the Fed to hike at each of its next nine meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Paulsen said he agrees the Fed should be raising rates but doing so deliberately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "If you're going to do shock and awe out of the gate, or let it hang out there that you might, it just adds more uncertainty," he said. "It would be more helpful if the Fed said we're going to get to this point, but we're going to be measured."                                                                                                                                                                       , In remarks Monday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman lent some credence to the idea when she hinted that a 50-basis-point hike in March is still on the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "I will be watching the data closely to judge the appropriate size of an increase at the March meeting," Bowman said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The S&amp;P 500 is officially in a correction.

Policymakers will be focused on the so-called core PCE data, which excludes food and energy and is expected to show a 5.1% year-over-year increase including a 0.5% jump for the month., If that estimate proves accurate, it will be the fastest one-year acceleration since September 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said during an appearance in New York Friday that "the current stance of monetary policy is wrong-footed and needs substantial adjustment." The words were notable from an FOMC member generally regarded as one of the most dovish, or in favor of loose policy and low interest rates.                                                                                               , "Clearly, it is another understatement to say that inflation has greatly exceeded the moderate persistent overshooting of 2% the Committee sought earlier and that a policy adjustment is in order," Evans said. "But how big will it need to be?"                                                                                                                                                                         , Got a confidential news tip?

On the other hand, several diplomats signaled that a decision to revive the Iran nuclear deal is likely to be made this week, which could mean more than 1 million barrels a day of additional supply to the market. </td>

But Sommers warned that this course of action could have little to no effect if Russia decides to fully invade.                                                                                               , "Nord Stream 2 is less of an issue once they invade Ukraine, and that should be very concerning to the European Union because they're dependent on Russia for their energy security, and really the world, because the world depends on natural gas," Sommers explained.                                                                                                                        , RUSSIA CONFLICT STOKES ENERGY CONCERNS AS GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO CLIMB                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Sommers claimed Ukrainian-owned and operated pipelines are a "key source" of energy for the European continent, and a Russian invasion would give Vladimir Putin access to European markets through Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                    , "Once you have access to all that pipeline infrastructure in the country of Ukraine, [Nord Stream 1, Nord Stream 2] pipelines become less relevant," the oil industry insider explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , He believes the European Union decided that "they no longer wanted to be an energy leader" the moment it started subcontracting their energy security to Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Adviser Investments portfolio manager Adam Johnson discusses how the Russia-Ukraine conflict impacts the markets and whether the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes will be able to tamp down inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                              , "We [the U.S.] don't want to be in that same position that Europe has put itself in," Sommers pointed out, "which is to be dependent on a hostile neighbor to their east for their energy supplies."                                                                                                                                                                                            , The quickest solution, he believes, is to put more oil supply on the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "The price of oil isn't just based on what happens in Russia or in the United States," Somers said. "Supply is the key here, and we need to be putting more supply on the market as quickly as possible so that Russia is not the world energy leader."                                                                                                                                         , He went on to say that natural gas is a "resource that we have here" in the U.S. and should take advantage of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Before the pandemic hit, the United States was the world's largest oil producer. We continue to be today, but we're about 1.6 million barrels off where we were prior to the pandemic… And that should be concerning to every American because this is a resource that we have here," he explained.                                                                                            , Sommers believes President Biden and his energy policies are culpable for mounting concerns surrounding energy security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , FOX Business' Edward Lawrence reports on how U.S. prices could rise alongside Russia-Ukraine tensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "The regulatory environment here in the United States has only gotten worse over the course of the last year.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Peru’s economy advanced 3.2 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, easing from an 11.4 percent expansion in the previous period as low base effects from the pandemic began to fade. Still, there was an increase in activity and demand, as the economy continued to recover from the recession brought by the pandemic. The main contributors to GDP growth were transportation and storage (14 percent vs 27.4 percent in Q3), hotels and restaurants (45.7 percent vs 100.7 percent), agriculture (5.6 percent vs 10.5 percent), commerce (3.8 percent vs 10 percent), and manufacturing (1.3 percent vs 7.8 percent). On the other hand, output continued to fall for fishing (-7.9 percent vs -39.6 percent). On a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, the GDP remained constant during the fourth quarter, following an upwardly revised 2.9 percent expansion during Q3. Considering the full 2021, Peru’s economy grew 13.3 percent, rebounding from an 11 percent contraction in 2020. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The South African rand was trading around 15.1 against USD, remaining close to its highest since November 9th 2021, after South Africa's National Treasury flagged an improved fiscal and debt outlook at the 2022 budget, despite heightened uncertainty around the Ukraine crisis. The finance minister announced some tax relief to stimulate the economy while allocating funds for the extension of the jobless relief payment for the coming year. The currency has been supported by rising prices of precious metals such as gold, which benefits the resource-rich South Africa, along with fresh reform pledges by President Ramaphosa in its pro-business state of the nation address. At the same time, the South African Reserve Bank is expected to hike its main lending rate by another 25 basis points next month, extending a tightening cycle that began in November to anchor inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the prospect of a more hawkish Fed limited further gains. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The JSE FTSE All Share index closed 0.9% down at 74,987 on Wednesday, its lowest since February 1st, as investors monitored heightening tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Meanwhile, South African Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana presented an improved fiscal and debt outlook during its 2022 budget speech. He said that higher prices for South Africa's key commodities exports would increase tax receipts, but pledged to keep a lid on spending growth amid a need for deeper structural reforms. At the same time, traders continued to monitor corporate earnings. South African pharmaceutical firm Adcock Ingram said its profits were up 30% for the six months ended December 31; while South Africa's largest private school operator Curro has restored its dividend payout after returning to profit in 2021. </td>

Mid-month consumer price data showed that the annual inflation rate accelerated to 10.76%, higher than market expectations and the central bank’s target of 3.5%.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB Index fell 0.3% to close at 25,995 on Wednesday, down for the fifth straight session to its lowest in four weeks amid escalated tension in Ukraine. Kyiv authorities declared a state of emergency in the country following cyberattacks on government and bank websites, while the Kremlin started to evacuate its Kyiv embassy. Investors continued to weigh on a round of sanctions on Russia from multiple NATO members and the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline certification, while leaving room for harsher measures should Russia continue westward. In Milan, Cnh Industrial (-6%) led the losses after the group stated it still expects supply chain problems throughout the year, despite increasing its guidance in the coming years. At the same time, Telecom Italia fell 3.3% following news that it is considering selling its stake at Inwit (1.8%) to the investment group Ardian, amid possibilities of a major asset shake up by telecom. </td>

Investors continued to assess sanctions on Russia announced by western states after Moscow recognized two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states, before deploying troops. The EU imposed sanctions on 27 individuals and financial institutions, leaving room for harsher measures should Russia invade regions outside the Donbass, while Germany halted the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. After being up over 1.2% in the session, Engie closed 0.1% down due to the utility’s exposure to Nord Stream 2 AG, Gazprom’s subsidiary responsible for the pipeline. On the other hand, Stellantis (4.5%) and Danone (3.8%) booked gains from strong corporate results. </td>

On the data front, the latest PMIs surprised on the upside and pointed to a strong rebound in UK’s private sector activity; while UK annual inflation unexpectedly accelerated more than expected to a new high since March 1992.

Several countries announced more sanctions on Russia while Ukraine introduced a state of emergency, a new sign that tensions are far from over and a diplomatic solution seems less likely, which, in turn, exacerbated fears of supply disruptions. On top of that, the potential return of Iranian crude also weighed on prices after several diplomats signalled that a decision to revive the Iran nuclear deal is likely to be made this week. A potential agreement could add more than 1 million barrels a day of supply to the market. </td>

He talked 2024, Russia and, well, just about everything else.                                                                                                                              , I went through the transcript and pulled out the lines from the former President that you need to see. They're below.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , 1. "Politically, I guess, you see the polls, and the polls for me have never been higher."                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The question Trump was asked was, "How are you doing?" And away we go!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , 2. "The polls have been extraordinary: 96% approval rating — and saw one this morning, 98%, but 96% approval rating — in the Republican Party and doing well with independents, doing well with women, doing well with everybody."                                                                                       , I can't find any recent poll where Trump's approval rating is at 96% among Republicans. That shouldn't surprise you though. He has been saying his approval rating is 96% -- without any actual polling to back it up -- for years now.                                                                                  , 3. "I think that has a lot to do with what's going on in Ukraine. You look at inflation. You look at all of the different things that are happening so bad for our country. The border. Who could forget the border? Millions of people, not two million or one million, like they say."                                 , This is unedited. He actually said these six sentences one right after another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , 4. "Many of these people come from prisons. They're being let out."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , I searched and searched for even a single news story that claimed that other countries were releasing their prisoners so they could come into the United States. I found none.                                                                                                                                           , 5. "But many of these countries are emptying their prisons like we're a dumping ground right into our country. I've never seen anything like it."                                                                                                                                                                        , Again, there is zero evidence for this claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , 6. "You can take the five worst presidents in the history of our country and put them together; I don't think they've done the damage that this administration has done."                                                                                                                                                , So, um, about the five worst presidents ... well, the thing is ... this is awkward ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , 7. "Well, what went wrong was a rigged election and what went wrong is a candidate that shouldn't be there and a man that has no concept of what he's doing."                                                                                                                                                            , Trump was asked what went wrong with Russia and Ukraine. His answer was that the 2020 US election was stolen. Which, uh, what?                                                                                                                                                                                           , 8. "I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful."                                                                                                              , Surely Trump isn't suggesting Russia's claim that parts of Ukraine are now their own countries is "genius," right? RIGHT?!!                                                                                                                                                                                              , 9. "So, Putin is now saying, 'It's independent,' a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper."                                                                                                                                                                    , Oh, so he was serious. This is the former president of the United States praising an authoritarian ruler as "smart." It's hard for me to be shocked by anything Trump does at this point, but this statement is truly shocking.                                                                                          , 10. "We could use that on our southern border. That's the strongest peace force I've ever seen."                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Russia is massing troops at the eastern and northern borders of Ukraine. And Trump is suggesting America should do the same at our southern border. So ... [head explodes].                                                                                                                                              , 11. "Here's a guy who's very savvy. ... I know him very well. Very, very well."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Again, this is the former President of the United States praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. It's absolutely nuts -- and deeply irresponsible.                                                                                                                                                                    , 12. "Here's a guy that says, you know, 'I'm gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent' -- he used the word 'independent' -- 'and we're gonna go out and we're gonna go in and we're gonna help keep peace.' You gotta say that's pretty savvy."                                                                 , Just heaping praise on potentially the biggest provocation in Europe since World War II ... no biggie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , 13. "Well, I'd rather see them send soldiers to our southern border. I'd rather see them ... In three weeks, you could finish it."                                                                                                                                                                                       , This is Trump suggesting, again, that the Biden administration should militarize our southern border.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , 14. "I knew Putin very well. I got along with him great. He liked me. I liked him. I mean, you know, he's a tough cookie, got a lot of the great charm and a lot of pride."                                                                                                                                              , He really can't say enough nice things about Putin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , 15. "I think he sees this opportunity. I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it. I said, 'You can't do it. You're not gonna do it.' But I could see that he wanted it."                                                                                                                      , "But I could see that he wanted it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , 16. "I think nobody probably knows him better in terms of the discussions that we have or that we're having this morning. So, I knew him very well."                                                                                                                                                                     , So, no one in the world knows Putin better than Trump? Whatever you say, man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , 17. "So, when we heard about this, nobody knew anything about it. Nobody had any idea -- other than I said very early on it came, obviously it came from the Wuhan lab, and I took a lot of heat."                                                                                                                       , A report from the Director of National Intelligence made clear that sources are divided as to whether the virus originated in a market near Wuhan, China or in a lab.                                                                                                                                                    , 18.

It brought the stock market down 10.3 percent from its most recent peak on Jan. 3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , On Wednesday, the index dropped another 1.84 percent, bringing its losses from the record to 11.9 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In Wall Street jargon, that meant the S&amp;P 500 is in a “correction,” because its losses since Jan. 3 exceeded 10 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , That 10 percent definition is entirely arbitrary and the subject of many quibbles, but this much is clear: A correction is not a good thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “It’s an early warning indicator that tells you the market isn’t heading in the direction you want it to be going in,” said Edward Yardeni, an independent Wall Street economist who has compiled detailed records on modern stock market history. “A 10 percent decline isn’t that bad in itself, necessarily, but if the market keeps heading down, the next thing you know, you’re down 20 percent and then by common agreement you’re in a bear market, and, maybe, worrying about a recession.”, Note: Bear markets are highlighted in red. The low point of the correction from the peak on Jan. 3, 2022, has yet to be determined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Source: Yardeni Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , What makes the market decline disconcerting is that an escalating geopolitical conflict in Eastern Europe is now being added to the stock market’s ample woes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Stocks have been falling for weeks, for a variety of reasons. Concerns about the prospect of rising interest rates and generally tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve are at the top of my personal list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The Fed is, perhaps belatedly, planning at its meeting on March 15-16 to start increasing its benchmark funds rate from its current near-zero level, and then to begin reducing its $8.9 trillion balance sheet. All that is intended to mitigate the inflation that is running at an annual rate of 7.5 percent, a 40-year high.                                                                                                                                                                   , In addition, the death, illness and inconvenience caused by the coronavirus pandemic have had myriad pernicious effects. The labor force in the United States is smaller than it would be otherwise, and the economy’s service sector hasn’t fully rebounded. The pandemic has also caused supply chain bottlenecks that have held back sales and production and increased the prices of important products as varied as automobiles and kitchen appliances.                                        , Many publicly traded companies are circumventing these problems and passing the associated costs on to consumers, but their ability to keep doing so, while generating the profits that fuel the stock market, is questionable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The Russia-Ukraine crisis threatens to make matters worse for the economy and the markets. Russia produces important commodities, like palladium, which is needed in the catalytic converters of gasoline-powered automobiles, and whose prices have contributed to the high inflation in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The anticipation of interruptions in commodity supplies has increased prices in futures markets, particularly for oil and natural gas, all of which could go much higher if the Ukraine crisis intensifies and if Western sanctions begin to bite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , For those who remember the 1970s and early 1980s, an era of soaring inflation and multiple recessions caused in part by a geopolitical shift and two oil shocks, the possibility of a 2020s parallel is deeply disturbing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , So is the fact that Russia is a nuclear power engaging in aggressive action against an independent country that is supported by NATO. The possibility that the conflict could be the start of a new Cold War, or something even worse, can’t be totally dismissed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , That said, for investors, it’s worth remembering that since the stock market hit bottom in March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 rose 114.4 percent through Jan. 3. Compared with that stupendous increase, the market’s decline since then has been inconsequential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Source: Refinitiv                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , What’s more, although just about everyone who closely follows the stock market agrees that it has had a correction, there is no agreement on when it took place. Laszlo Birinyi, who began analyzing the market with Salomon Brothers back in 1976, says a correction happens whenever the market crosses the 10 percent border, whether it’s at the end of the trading day or in the middle of it.                                                                                                 , That’s why Mr. Birinyi, who heads his own independent stock market research firm, Birinyi Associates, in Westport, Conn., says a market correction occurred on Jan. 24, not on Tuesday. The market at one point on Jan. 24 dropped as far as 12 percent below its close on Jan. 3 before rebounding smartly. “The psychology of the market, the mood, shifted then,” Mr. Birinyi said. “People were panicky until then — and then they weren’t.”                                                    , A rising concern. A Russian attack on Ukraine could cause dizzying spikes in energy and food prices and spook investors. The economic damage from supply disruptions and economic sanctions would be severe in some countries and industries and unnoticed in others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The cost of energy. Oil prices already are the highest since 2014, and they have risen as the conflict has escalated. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, providing roughly one of every 10 barrels the global economy consumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders have accused Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, of reducing supplies to gain a political edge.                                                                                                                                                                                                , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat and, together with Ukraine, accounts for nearly a quarter of total global exports. In countries like Egypt and Turkey, that flow of grain makes up more than 70 percent of wheat imports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions designed to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                , The market has moved sideways since then, and has now dropped a bit further. In purely financial terms, that decline, in itself, isn’t a big deal, in his estimation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr. Birinyi focuses on picking individual stocks, not on market averages, and says he doesn’t let such minor things as market corrections affect his strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “We don’t focus on 10 percent increases when the market is on its way up,” he said. “We wouldn’t sell stocks just because there’s been a 10 percent gain. And it doesn’t really matter if there’s a 10 percent decline, either.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , For his part, Mr. Yardeni says he views Jan. 24 as a psychologically important moment, too. It represented “a capitulation in the markets” — a juncture at which many investors simply gave up and sold their shares, allowing the market momentum to shift as bargain seekers began to bid up stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr. Yardeni labels episodes like these as “panic attacks” and says Jan. 24 was the end of the 73rd such attack since the start of a long bull market in 2009. The Russian hostilities and the stock market decline on Tuesday probably represented the 74th attack. “There’s no science here,” he said. “It’s totally subjective.”                                                                                                                                                                  , Investors panic easily, he said, but they will be better off, most of the time, if they just hang on. “I don’t think we’re in a bear market, is really what I’m saying,” he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , As far as market labels like these go, I’m agnostic. Are we in a bull market, a bear market, a correction or a panic attack? I can’t say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , I know only that the geopolitics of the Ukraine crisis make me nervous in a way no simple market decline can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , It doesn’t pay to panic. But this week, I’m worried.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago wheat futures skyrocketed to a 9-year high of 863.5 USd/Bu on supply worries amid escalating tensions between global crop heavyweights Russia and Ukraine. With the two countries accounting for roughly 30% of the world’s wheat exports, any conflict in the region would take out crucial supplies from an already tight market. Additionally, low inventories in the US and Canada, the second and third-largest exporters globally, added to upside risks. Total wheat stocks in Canada were 38% down from a year yearlier at the end of 2021, as yields were poor due to drought in farms in the Prairie region. Droughts also hampered US output as sales and exports in the week ending February 3rd totalled 17.3 million tonnes, 21% lower than USDA projections of 22.05 million tonnes. </td>

On top of that, worries of escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine lent further optimism to bulls. Both EU and UK gas prices surged more than 10% on such fears. The West imposed a new set of sanctions on Moscow after President Putin ordered troops into Ukraine following the recognition of two separatist republics. EIA data showed that the United States supplied more than half of all LNG imports into Europe in January 2022, and it grew from 3.4 billion Bcf/d in November 2021 to a record 6.5 Bcf/d in the first month of the year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> To hurt Russia, the West needs to punish itself - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN Business)Punishing Vladimir Putin and Russia for their aggression against Ukraine will cost us at home. Because to hit Russia where it really hurts, we'd have to hurt everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Russia is a top oil and natural gas producer, so the world is addicted to its exports. In fact, the European Union depends on Russia for more than a third of its natural gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , That's why Germany's move to cancel the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would deliver Russian natural gas to Germany is so dramatic. Russia's ex-president seemed to gloat about the EU's dependence Tuesday, tweeting, "Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay 2.000 euros for 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas!"                                                                                                                             , The most effective way to target Russia with sanctions is to cut off its supply of oil and natural gas to the West. But that could trigger even higher prices and more pain for consumers. Oil prices already are near 8-year-highs and serve as a major driver of inflation. It is already taking a toll politically and these decisions will be tough to enact for the West's leaders.                                                                                                            , "The president of the United States has to worry about his domestic polls heading into a new election season and leaders in Europe have their own domestic political constraints as well," CNN political analyst Josh Rogin told me. "It ends up limiting the range of responses, the range of action that the allies can put into place in response to Putin's aggression. Of course, Putin knows that. That's a reality of democracies and it's an advantage for Putin that he's sure to exploit.", The White House and allies have announced their first round of sanctions — on two banks, sovereign debt and some oligarchs — with more sanctions coming if Putin persists.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Soybeans Hits 41-week High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Soybeans increased to a 41-week high of $16.65 a bushel amid ongoing concerns about harvests in the world's largest producers and exporters of processed soy. Argentina and Brazil have been facing abnormally dry conditions linked to the La Niña pattern, hitting the quality and quantity of crops. As a result, the latest USDA monthly crop report pegged Brazil's soy crop at 134 million tonnes, down from 139 million in January, and Argentina's soy crop at 45 million, down from 46.5 million. The report also pointed to smaller US soybean supplies amid rising demand from the crushing industry. Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to export 7.5 million tonnes of soybeans in February, down from 9.923 million tonnes projected the week prior by farm consultancy ANEC. </td>

One of the best things we can do to try to deter President Xi from invading Taiwan is by making life as uncomfortable as possible for Vladimir Putin in Ukraine.

While she noted the U.S. has minor banking, financial and trade interests with Russia – which would not have a "significant impact" on the U.S. economy if a war broke out – she acknowledged there are "potential impacts" on the energy markets. , "Obviously we’ll continue to watch that, and if we believe that might have some influence on the global economy, we’ll take that into account as we’re going into our meetings and discussing the economy more broadly," she said. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The offshore yuan strengthened to 6.308 per USD, the strongest level since April 2018, as the escalation of tensions between Russia and the West boosted foreign demand for the Chinese currency. The latest Western sanctions against Russia’s financial sector have helped accelerate a trend which saw Russian institutions diversify away from the greenback, into the yuan, among other currencies. Harsher sanctions on the table include complete restrictions on USD transactions by Russian firms, which would further boost demand for the yuan over the long-run, risking efforts by the People’s Bank of China to keep the yuan steady and protect exports. Recently, the PBOC pumped more liquidity into the financial system and slashed several policy loan rates, with analysts saying policymakers have more room for expansionary monetary policy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, swung between gains and losses on Wednesday, amid mounting concerns over geopolitical tensions. Investors continued to assess the impact of the first tranche of sanctions on Russia while Ukraine suffered another broad cyberattack and will introduce a state of emergency. Meanwhile, Brazil's inflation in the month to mid-February rose more than expected to the highest for that month in six years, indicating persistent inflationary pressures and reinforcing the trend of rising interest rates. On the earnings front, Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau reported a 237% jump in fourth-quarter net profit to 3.56 billion reais, but below market forecasts of 3.7 billion reais. Among others, Petrobras will also divulge corporate results after the close. On corporate news, Brazilian rental car firms Localiza and Unidas, are reportedly close to selling assets to win approval from antitrust watchdog Cade for their merger. </td>

His statement arrived while the jury was still deliberating last week.                                                                                                                                                                                 , The decision by Judge Jed S. Rakoff — which was consistent with the verdict the jury arrived at the next day, holding that The Times was not liable for publishing and later correcting an editorial that erroneously linked the political rhetoric of Ms. Palin to a mass shooting — was the subject of a brief conference call on Wednesday between the judge and lawyers for both sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Judge Rakoff said Ms. Palin’s requests amounted to “five interesting motions,” including one that he be retroactively disqualified from the case. Another would allow her lawyers to interview the jurors, several of whom learned of his decision from push notifications they received on their phones while deliberating. In an order last week, Judge Rakoff said several jurors had told the court’s law clerk that the notifications “had not affected them in any way or played any role whatever in their deliberations.”                                                                            , The judge said he would review the motions once they had been filed. The motions would become part of the record should Ms. Palin appeal, which she is expected to do. Judge Rakoff also said he would expedite writing his decision outlining why he agreed to dismiss the case. He expects that to be ready by March 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Another of Ms. Palin’s motions sought to reveal what, if any, communications Judge Rakoff had with the news media during the trial — an insinuation he appeared irritated by.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “I had zero communications with media during the trial,” he said. “None whatsoever.” He explained that while he had responded to a reporter’s urgent phone message after the verdict — which turned out to be about the push notifications — he had not communicated with the media at all while the trial was ongoing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , By William P.

Little of that goes to the United States, but the escalating tensions between Russia and the West have helped fuel a global increase in prices, which already were the highest since 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that a release of reserves was “certainly an option on the table.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , America’s emergency stockpile, which has about 580 million barrels of oil, has already been tapped recently: President Biden ordered a release of 50 million barrels in November as he sought to drive down gas prices that have contributed to high inflation and pushed OPEC Plus, the cartel of oil producers that includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others, to pump more oil. The United States consumes roughly 20 million barrels of oil a day.                                                                                                               , That release had little, if any, effect. Oil prices, which had been around $76 before the announcement, actually rose after it — analysts had been expecting a larger release. Prices eventually fell after the announcement of the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus, which stoked fears of another slowdown in travel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But the price for a barrel of U.S. crude has since jumped. Brent crude, the global benchmark, neared $100 a barrel on Tuesday, and West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has topped $95 a barrel. Both have since fallen in price slightly. Prices at the pump have ticked up, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The pain from any disruption could be most acute in Europe. Russia supplies a large portion of the region’s natural gas, which has been soaring in price over the past year. The region’s stockpiles are low, and relief is unlikely to come soon — on Tuesday, Germany said it was stopping regulatory progress on Nord Stream 2, a new natural gas pipeline connecting it with Russia, part of a set of coordinated sanctions after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered troops into breakaway regions of Ukraine. There is also concern Mr. Putin could cut off or limit supplies in retaliation., So far, sanctions have not directly targeted Russia’s energy industry and there has not been any direct impact to supplies. And prices have been steadied by reports last week of progress on talks to revive a nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran, a development that could allow tens of millions of barrels of oil onto the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , By Daisuke Wakabayashi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , As Google prepares to bring workers back to its offices, the company is relaxing some of its Covid-19 workplace policies, including a rule requiring U.S. employees to be vaccinated. But workers will still have to be vaccinated if they plan to use the company’s offices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In an email to San Francisco Bay Area employees last week, Google said it was easing some of its pandemic restrictions. It will no longer require employees to be tested weekly to enter its U.S. offices. Also, it will not require staff to wear masks in the office, with the exception of Santa Clara County — home to Google’s main Mountain View headquarters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Google also said it planned to restore many of its famed office amenities, such as fitness centers, cafeterias, massage services and commuter shuttles. CNBC reported the change in policies earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Based on current conditions in the Bay Area, we’re pleased that our employees who choose to come in now have the ability to access more on-site spaces and services,” Google wrote in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Separately, the company has dropped its requirement that U.S. employees provide evidence of vaccination status or apply for a medical or religious exemption, Lora Lee Erickson, a Google spokeswoman, said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Last year, Google said employees who failed to do so would be placed on administrative leave and could be fired eventually. Ms. Erickson did not explain why the company had changed its position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Like many companies, Google has had to adapt its policies to the frequently changing conditions of the pandemic. It has repeatedly pushed back plans for when it will ask employees to start working on a hybrid schedule that mixes remote work and in-office time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Google’s offices are a key component to its work culture, and the company has resisted going fully remote like other technology companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Instead of a global mandate, Google has repeatedly said it will allow different regions to determine when to start requiring workers to come in a few times a week. In the United States, Google said, it is still assessing the right time to begin its hybrid work schedule and hasn’t set a date for workers to return to the office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , While returning to the office is still voluntary, Google said about 30 percent of its Bay Area employees came into the office last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , By Noam Scheiber                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The National Labor Relations Board dealt a blow to Starbucks’s legal strategy in response to a growing union campaign on Wednesday, rejecting the company’s argument that workers seeking to unionize in a geographic area must vote in a single union election.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In a ruling involving an election in Mesa, Ariz., the board noted the longstanding presumption that a single store is an appropriate unit for a vote — as union supporters have insisted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Starbucks workers at more than 100 stores nationwide have filed for union elections and workers at two stores in Buffalo have already unionized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Unions typically prefer smaller elections, which tend to increase their chances of winning, albeit on a smaller scale. Workers United, the union seeking to represent Starbucks employees, has complained that Starbucks has repeatedly resisted store-by-store elections despite gaining little traction on the issue as a way to delay votes and stop the union’s momentum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Starbucks has argued that the elections should be marketwide because employees can work at multiple locations and because the stores in a market are managed as a relatively cohesive unit. It has made this case in its requests to appeal labor board decisions ordering elections on a store-by-store basis in Buffalo and Mesa, and in other filings related to union elections around the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Before Wednesday’s ruling, the board had been unmoved by the company’s argument in Buffalo as well. But unlike the request for an appeal in Buffalo, which the board rejected on an ad hoc basis, the action in the Arizona case sets a binding precedent and will most likely make it more difficult for Starbucks to raise such objections in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Nonetheless, the company indicated it would still press the issue. “Our position since the beginning has been that all partners in a market or district deserve the right to vote on a decision that will impact them,” Reggie Borges, a Starbucks spokesman, said in a statement, using the company’s term for its employees. “We will continue to respect the N.L.R.B.’s process and advocate for our partners’ ability to make their voices heard.”                                                                                                                                                       , Workers in Mesa and at three Buffalo-area locations have voted in store-by-store elections, but the board postponed those vote counts while resolving Starbucks’s appeals. In the short term, the board decision means that a vote count at a Starbucks store in Mesa can go forward after being postponed last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In a statement Wednesday, the union criticized both Starbucks and the labor board for the delays in counting ballots. “Partners are confident in our ability to stand strong, but justice delayed is justice denied, and we will continue to push for our right to organize without delay,” the statement said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , By Matthew Goldstein                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The rollout of Truth Social, former President Donald J. Trump’s social media alternative to Twitter, has gotten off to a slow start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump’s account on the app, available free on Apple’s App Store since Monday, had just under 50,000 followers. That is a far cry from the tens of millions of followers he had on Twitter before the social media platform barred him last year after some of his supporters attacked the Capitol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr. Trump’s account still has a single post, which the company calls “truths” as opposed to “tweets.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The official debut of Truth Social on Monday was marred by error messages and a long waiting list for people who had already signed up to download the app. (This reporter was at 94,000 on the list but was able to download the app on Tuesday.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Technical glitches for new apps are not uncommon, and the parent company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, had said it didn’t expect the new platform to be fully operational before the end of March. Truth Social posted a message from its own account that said “our team is working as fast as possible.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The app’s glitchy start didn’t appear to have deterred investors, who continue to push up the share price of Digital World Acquisition, the special purpose acquisition company that Trump Media announced plans to merge with in October. On Tuesday, Digital World’s stock rose 14 percent to close at just over $96 a share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Digital World has become the best performing SPAC — a kind of company that goes public first, raising money from investors to buy a private company. The stock has continued to rise even in the face of regulatory investigations into how exactly Digital World’s deal with Trump Media came about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Because of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it is unclear when the merger will close. If and when it does, Trump Media will gain access to nearly $1.3 billion in cash, which would help build its social media business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , By Monika Pronczuk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Large companies operating in the European Union could be held responsible for environmental violations or human rights abuses committed by businesses in their supply chains under a law proposed on Wednesday by the European Commission, the bloc’s administrative arm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “We can no longer turn a blind eye on what happens down our value chains,” said Didier Reynders, the European Union’s commissioner for justice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Under the legislation, known as a due diligence law, businesses would need to establish regulations to detect, prevent and mitigate breaches of human rights, such as child labor, as well as environmental hazards in their supply chains. National governments would define the financial penalties for companies violating the rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Victims could sue for compensation in domestic courts of E.U. member nations, even if the harm occurred outside the bloc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The commission proposed the rules after some member nations, including Germany and France, introduced different versions of due diligence law at the national level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The legislation will now be discussed by the European Parliament and the 27 national governments, with all parties able to modify the language. The final draft will require passage by the E.U. lawmakers and member nations. The whole process could take a year or more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The proposal would initially apply to companies with more than 500 employees and annual revenue over 150 million euros (about $170 million), a group that includes about 10,000 E.U. businesses, about 1 percent of the total. Around 2,000 companies based outside the bloc but doing business in the European Union, amounting to an annual revenue of more than €150 million, would also be covered. After two years, the range would be expanded to include smaller businesses in so-called high-impact sectors, such as textiles, food products and mining.                                             , Businesses expressed concern over the proposal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “It is unrealistic to expect that European companies can control their entire value chains across the world,” said Pierre Gattaz, president of BusinessEurope, a trade organization. “Ultimately these proposals will harm our companies’ ability to remain competitive worldwide.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But Richard Gardiner of Global Witness said the legislation had the potential to become “a watershed moment for human rights and the climate crisis,” if the European Union resisted efforts to water down the proposed measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “We’ve been investigating big corporations for decades, and when we reveal the harm they’re causing to people and planet, the response is invariably the same: ‘We weren’t aware,’” Mr. Gardiner said. “Today’s proposal from the commission may make that response illegal.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , But some analysts remained skeptical, pointing out that the commission’s final proposal, which was delayed several times, is much less ambitious than what was initially planned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “This outcome is the result of an unprecedented level of corporate lobbying,” said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of European Union law at the business school HEC Paris.

The Nasdaq composite fell 2.6 percent. And the Stoxx Europe 600 index, which had spent most of the day in positive territory, ended down 0.3 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Tuesday’s trading saw the S&amp;P 500 drop as much as 1.9 percent. Even after rebounding off those lows by the end of the day, the index still closed more than 10 percent off its January peak. A drop that big is known on Wall Street as a correction and generally indicates a marked shift in sentiment among investors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , After Wednesday’s losses, the S&amp;P 500 is 11.9 percent off its record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Russia is under increasing pressure as the United States and its allies have rolled out penalties in response to the crisis in Ukraine. The global response began Tuesday in an effort to deter President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from further aggression. Germany halted a key natural gas pipeline for Russia, while Britain imposed sanctions on several Russian banks and three Russian billionaires.                                                                                                                                                                                                , Oil prices edged lower after they surged to nearly $100 a barrel during Tuesday’s session after Russia ordered troops into eastern Ukraine.

That year, The New York Times described it as “an audacious bet that there was room for a cerebral, politically conservative daily in the already crowded New York City newspaper market.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Sun has made splashes from its inception. It debuted in 1833 and two years later began publishing a series of bogus articles about creatures found living on the moon. Later, in 1897, it answered a letter from a young reader with what became one of journalism’s most famous editorials: “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The 1954 film “On the Waterfront” (in which Mr. Brando says, “I coulda been a contender”) was inspired by The Sun’s coverage of labor union corruption. And the final scene of the 2006 film “The Devil Wears Prada” was filmed inside The Sun’s office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Efune praised The Sun last year for “practicing precisely the form of journalism that’s so lacking in today’s media environment: values-based, principled and constitutionalist.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Subscriptions to The Sun — which cost a penny when it debuted on newsstands in 1833 — will range from $12 a month for articles and access to comments, to $25 a month for audio, video and crossword puzzles, to $2,500 annually, for “invitations to regular phone briefings and exclusive events,” according to a company statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , By Neal E.

And China, which has traditionally made energy security a priority, has further stepped up its coal production and approved three new billion-dollar coal mines this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “Get your rig count up,” Jennifer Granholm, the U.S. energy secretary, said in December, urging American oil producers to raise their output.

And this month, Exxon Mobil announced plans to increase spending on new oil wells and other projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford, warned that high energy prices could lead to more exploration of traditional fossil fuels. “Governments will want to deprioritize renewables and sustainables, which would be exactly the wrong response,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Europe’s transition to sustainable energy has always been an intricate calculus.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The case for bitcoin as 'digital gold' is falling apart </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , A key investment case for bitcoin is deteriorating as geopolitical uncertainty and rising inflation hammer cryptocurrency prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                , The price of bitcoin fell to a two-week low Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, shortly after declaring them as independent.                                                                                                       , Bitcoin is often referred to as "digital gold" by its backers. The term refers to the idea that bitcoin can provide a store of value similar to gold — one that's uncorrelated with other financial markets, like stocks.                                                                                                        , Bitcoin bulls also see the cryptocurrency as a "safe haven" asset that can serve as a hedge against global economic uncertainty and increasing prices, which reduce the purchasing power of sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar.                                                                                           , With inflation at historic highs, you'd expect this would be bitcoin's time to shine — U.S. consumer prices last month rose the most since February 1982, according to Labor Department figures.                                                                                                                                 , Instead, the cryptocurrency has lost almost half of its value since reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. That's led analysts to question whether its status as a form of "digital gold" still rings true.                                                                                                    , "Bitcoin is still early in its maturity curve to be firmly placed in the category of 'digital gold,'" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC.                                                                                                                 , The latest declines for bitcoin came in tandem with a rout in global stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 closing out Tuesday's session in correction territory. Bitcoin's price has increasingly been tracking moves in the stock market, with correlation between bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 steadily rising.                                 , Experts say cryptocurrencies have become more closely linked to other speculative parts of the market such as tech stocks, which are falling due to fears that lofty valuations may come down as the Federal Reserve and other central banks begin to hike interest rates and wind down their huge stimulus packages.            , "The correlation between crypto and stocks has been high over the last few months on both inflation-related macro news and the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical situation," Chris Dick, a quantitative trader at crypto market maker B2C2, told CNBC.                                                                                 , "This correlation shows that bitcoin is firmly behaving like a risk asset at the moment — not the safe haven it was touted to be a few years ago."                                                                                                                                                                               , In fact, gold has actually been outperforming bitcoin lately. Spot rates for the precious metal reached their highest levels since June 1 on Tuesday, climbing as high as $1,913.89 per troy ounce.                                                                                                                              , "Bitcoin, the asset purported to be the answer to every question, has quietly weakened and is notably underperforming its arch enemy, gold," John Roque, head of technical strategy at 22V Research, said in a research note Monday.                                                                                             , "We're looking for Bitcoin to get back to 30,000 and then break below there and we continue to expect gold will make a new all-time high."                                                                                                                                                                                       , Bitcoin's slump has resulted in increased talk about a prolonged bear market known as "crypto winter." The last such occurrence of this took place during late 2017 and early 2018, when bitcoin plunged as much as 80% from then-record highs of close to $20,000.                                                              , Not all analysts are convinced the latest downturn in digital currency prices is indicative of a crypto winter, though, with many saying market conditions have changed. There are now plenty of institutions holding bitcoin which, according to experts, is one reason for why it's become more closely correlated with stocks., "The adoption of cryptocurrencies by investors from traditional asset classes is the driving force behind bitcoin's correlation with equities," B2C2's Dick said. However, he added: "This relationship has the potential to be broken at any time given the different fundamentals for each market."                            , To compete more effectively with gold as a store of value, bitcoin needs to achieve more widespread adoption, according to Luno's Ayyar.                                                                                                                                                                                         , "The fundamentals have always made sense — limited supply currency not affiliated with any nation state," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "But bitcoin needs to undergo its due process of monetization, where it's held by a large enough pool of participants — more retail flow, larger institutions adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, [and] potentially more nation states after El Salvador buying Bitcoin."                                                    , Got a confidential news tip?

Lowe's earned $1.78 per share, 7 cents above estimates, and issued upbeat full-year guidance as demand for tools and building materials remained elevated.                                                                                                            , Tenneco (TEN) – The automotive components maker agreed to be acquired by affiliates of Apollo Global Management (APO) for $20 per share in cash, compared with Tenneco's Tuesday close of $9.98 per share. The deal is expected to close during the second half of this year. Tenneco soared 91.7% in premarket action.                                                                                                       , Tupperware (TUP) – The maker of home storage products saw its shares slump 3% in the premarket following its quarterly earnings report. Tupperware's revenue was above Street forecasts, but its adjusted profit of 38 cents per share missed estimates by 14 cents amid what the company called "challenging operating conditions."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago wheat futures were trading around $8.47 per bushel in late February, a level not seen in more than three months and closing in on its highest level since 2014 on supply worries amid escalating tensions between global crop heavyweights Russia and Ukraine. With the two countries accounting for roughly 30% of the world’s wheat exports, any conflict in the region would take out crucial supplies from an already tight market. Additionally, low inventories in the US and Canada, the second and third-largest exporters globally, added to upside risks. Total wheat stocks in Canada were 38% down on the year at the end of 2021, as yields were poor due to drought in farms in the Prairie region. Droughts also hampered US output as sales and exports in the week ending February 3rd totalled 17.3 million tonnes, 21% lower than USDA projections of 22.05 million tonnes. </td>

The goods trade shortfall shrank to USD 1.5 billion from USD 2.6 billion in January of 2021, helped by a 31.3 percent jump in exports to USD 19.8 billion against a softer 20.4 percent increase in imports to USD 21.3 billion. Conversely, the services trade gap widened significantly to USD 1.5 billion from USD 1.0 billion a year ago, amid larger net losses in the international travel account. Finally, the primary income deficit increased to USD 5.4 billion from USD 5.0 billion, while the secondary income surplus was little changed at USD 0.3 billion. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Australian dollar briefly hit an over five-week high of $0.7277 before steadying above $0.727 on Wednesday, as robust commodity prices supported the currency. Markets also took stock of Western sanctions imposed on Russia after Moscow ordered troops into two separatist regions of Ukraine. Meanwhile, Australian wages grew 2.3% on an annual basis in the December quarter, missing expectations and falling short of the 3%-plus levels that policymakers said would justify a rise in interest rates. The data added to growing uncertainty for the direction of monetary policy as markets have long been pricing in a hike in the 0.1% cash rate by June, with rates reaching 1.25% by year-end. Minutes of the RBA’s latest meeting also showed its Board was yet to be convinced that the acceleration in inflation would be sustained and wanted to see wages respond before lifting rates. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The JSE FTSE All Share index pared early losses to trade 0.6% down around 75,230 on Wednesday, its lowest since February 4th, after Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana delivered its 2022 budget speech, predicting lower budget deficits and a better debt trajectory than at a mid-term budget in November. He also announced a reduction in the company tax rate to 27% from April and reaffirmed the commitment to rein in pay for civil servants and limit bailouts for state companies. Meanwhile, developments around the Russia-Ukraine conflict remained in focus, with investors assessing a slew of western sanctions imposed on Russia for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. At the same time, traders continued to monitor corporate earnings. South African pharmaceutical firm Adcock Ingram said its profits were up 30% for the six months ended December 31; while South Africa's largest private school operator Curro has restored its dividend payout after returning to profit in 2021. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The South African rand was trading slightly higher around 15.0 against USD, its highest since November 9th 2021, as fears of war in Ukraine eased somewhat and after South Africa's National Treasury flagged an improved fiscal and debt outlook at the 2022 budget. The finance minister announced some tax relief to stimulate the economy while allocating funds for the extension of the jobless relief payment for the coming year. The currency has been supported by rising prices of precious metals such as gold, which benefits the resource-rich South Africa, along with fresh reform pledges by President Ramaphosa in its pro-business state of the nation address. At the same time, the South African Reserve Bank is expected to hike its main lending rate by another 25 basis points next month, extending a tightening cycle that began in November to anchor inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the prospect of a more hawkish Fed limited further gains. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Copper futures consolidated around the $4.5 per pound level in the last week of February, having been stuck in a tight range since mid-month as investors weighed concerns about the escalating crisis over Ukraine against robust demand and supply disruptions. Western countries, Australia and Japan, announced sanctions targeting Russian banks, the country’s sovereign debt and elites after Moscow ordered troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine. Aside from conflict headlines, copper usage is surging, especially in developed countries, with increasing demand for electric vehicles and wind farms, solar panels and the power grid. Also, a political shift across high producing countries Chile and Peru ignited civil protest against mining companies that often halt trucks from heading to and returning from the mines, exacerbating supply tightness. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South Africa's government revised its budget deficit forecast to 5.7% of GDP in the 2021/22 fiscal year from an earlier estimate of 7.8% in November, mainly due to better-than-expected tax collections, namely higher mining receipts. The budget gap should continue to shrink to 6% in 2022/23 (unrevised), 4.8% in 2023/24 (vs 5.3% earlier) and 4.2% in 2024/25 (vs 4.9%). Gross debt to GDP is seen peaking at 75.1% in 2024/25, compared to a peak of 78.1% in 2025/26 seen in November. The economy is seen expanding 4.8% in 2021 from an earlier estimate of 5.1%, before gradually slowing to 2.1% in 2022 (vs 1.8% in November), 1.6% in 2023 (unrevised) and 1.7% in 2024 (unrevised).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Production at Oxford's BMW Mini plant has been suspended for a week due to a global shortage of computer chips.                                                                                                                        , BMW said it was standing down production at its Cowley factory from Monday to Friday and was "monitoring the situation very closely".                                                                                                  , It comes after the firm suspended its production for three days in April over the shortage.                                                                                                                                            , Manufacturers around the world have been struggling to secure supplies of semiconductors.                                                                                                                                              , Chips are vital to modern cars, with features including touchscreen controls, automatic emergency brakes, reversing cameras, fuel efficiency equipment and airbag deployment systems all relying on them.                              , In a statement BMW said: "As a result of the global semiconductor shortage, an issue that has affected the entire automotive industry for the last year, Plant Oxford is making some short-term adjustments to its production schedule., "Plant Oxford is standing down five days of production - Monday 21 February to Friday 25 February inclusive, for all shifts.                                                                                                           , "We are monitoring the situation very closely and are in constant communication with our associates and suppliers."                                                                                                                    , The firm has been approached for further comment.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Around 3,500 workers are based at the plant which normally produces about 5,000 cars a week.                                                                                                                                           , Reacting to the announcement, Oxford East MP Anneliese Dodds said: "I am pleased to hear that BMW is working closely with the union to manage this situation, and that no employees will be going without pay as a result."            , Car makers around the world have been impacted by the chip shortage, along with supply chain disruptions, Covid-19 restrictions and rising prices of raw materials.                                                                    , Motor industry giants including Toyota, General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Daimler, BMW and Renault, have all been forced to scale back production in recent months as they struggled to secure enough semiconductors.                      , In February, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said semiconductor supplies constrained sales and it expected the chip shortage to continue throughout this year.                                                                                 , Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russian Ruble Remains Near 15-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Russian ruble was trading around 80 per USD, the weakest in 15 months as investors were digesting a round of sanctions announced by Western leaders in response to the deployment of Russian troops in self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics in eastern Ukraine. The US took measures against banks and prohibited participation on the secondary market for Russian sovereign debt, while Germany halted the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Harsher sanctions could also be imposed should Russian forces move further west from the Donbass. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Russia remains unsure of when to resume foreign exchange purchases due to the ruble's increased volatility. On its February 11th meeting, the CBR hiked its benchmark rate by 100bps to a five-year high of 9.5%, as widely expected, while signalling further hikes could take place in the next meetings. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The BSE Sensex ended 68.62 points or 0.12% lower to close at 57,232.06, losing for the sixth consecutive session and pared the early-day gains tracking an upcoming monthly expiry of derivatives contracts and continued foreign fund outflows on top of lingering Russia-Ukraine tensions. Meanwhile, India Ratings revised downwards India’s GDP growth forecast for 2021-22 to 8.6 percent from the consensus 9.2 percent projected earlier. Capital goods and financials fell the most, with declines coming particularly from National Thermal Power Corporation (-1.55%), construction-giant Larsen and Toubro (-1.13%), Nestle India (-0.93%), ICICI Bank (-0.89%) and Housing Development Finance Corporation (-0.67%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Indian 10Y Bond Yield Edges Down </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Indian 10Y Bond yield inched down to 6.74% tracking a slight retreat in crude oil prices after they jumped to their fresh 7-year highs. Oil prices pose a significant risk to India’s inflation outlook as India imports more than two-thirds of its oil needs. However, the yield is not far from its 2-½-year high of 6.89% hit on February 3rd as the central bank announced to do a debt auction two weeks from now after canceling previous two sales. This aligns with the Indian government’s record borrowing plan of USD 200 billion from April as proposed in the Union budget. At the same time, the RBI maintained a more dovish than expected monetary policy in February. With the RBI reassuring a delayed monetary policy normalization, it is unlikely to return to the pandemic-era measures of bond purchases. Last year, the RBI bought 2.2 trillion rupees of debt before stopping its bond-purchase program in October. </td>

4.  Biden is supporting moving and supplying weapons and equipment to Ukraine.
5.  The US and the West does almost no business with Ukraine.

An attempt by Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky to telephone his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has come to nothing. There was silence on the other side of the line, according to Zelensky, who says there are nearly 200,000 Russian troops on Ukraine&amp;#39;s borders.

The Ukrainian president said during a speech on the night from Wednesday to Thursday that thousands of Russian combat vehicles are lined up along the Ukrainian lands. Zelensky also addressed the Russian people in his speech: &amp;#39;The chance of a war with Ukraine also depends on you,&amp;#39; he wrote.

Zelensky followed with the warning that &amp;quot;a great war in Europe&amp;quot; could soon begin. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $ETSY I&amp;#39;ve got $130 calls and started a small hedge with $120 puts today shortly after market open. I&amp;#39;m going to increase my hedge shortly before close tomorrow, but maybe not as much as I had planned considering how much they rose in value since just this morning. lol

Still cheaper than $MSFT in nearly every metric, but we&amp;#39;re also in Dot-Com Bubble 2.0. Given market weakness, rising geopolitical tensions, inflation, potential rate hikes, and other grim macro/micro economic data, many catalysts could lead to the bubble popping.

Very interested to see both quarterly results and the markets response tomorrow and Friday. A huge amount of future performance is going to be dependent on how much longer this $SPY $QQQ bubble can hold itself from total collapse. </td>

Hedge funds , institutions with the help of algos set everyone up during Covid they pumped the market sky high and then the analyst had targets even higher then the pump , they all agreed the growth was justified while behind the scenes they unloaded the highest owned retail stocks and barely touched the highest institutionally owned ones . The sell off is due to rising rates no , that’s the excuse the reason the markets are coming down is hedge funds are unloading billions of shares. It’s such a broken scam system it’s hard to fathom it’s legal . I mean almost all US politicians  are millionaires on government salaries ? Pelosi alone is worth 100,000,000 $ . It’s gross . </td>

TSLA will lead the Market Pullback we will see in the next 2 months…

Trading @ almost 1/3 the market cap of 

Apple with nearly 14% of annual revenue compared to $AAPL made in 2021…

 THERE is some Valuation that needs adjusted! 

2021 Net income:
Apple: 94.6B
Tesla: 5.5B 

Lol 5.8% the net income… 😬

PeE ratio will get slashed soon… easy $600 median 🎯 pullback… $500 in the Rhelm of possibility 

Brace yourself for a potential 550 bottom this year… maybe even Warren buffet will buy at $500 </td>

You’ve weathered the storm, remember this is the worst time to sell, everything has almost been priced in. 7% interest, Russia/Ukraine. I’m down prob an avg of 35% on all my calls, with the worst being 52%, I buy 3+ months out so I don’t take a loss. I’ve sold, and bought commons this week. It always seems bad when the market gets hit like this. Don’t bet against the market, it has almost rolled over. It always prices in the worse case scenario. Like my dad always said, it’s too late to sell, time to buy. Green is coming. </td>

My portfolio consists of a bit of everything really. But my sights are mostly set on tech and innovation heading forward. Although I&amp;#39;d love to hear any under the radar picks also! 

Here are some that I&amp;#39;ve been adding or plan to add;  TTD, APPS, UPST, APPN, STNE, OPEN, PLTR, NTLA, CRSP, ERJ. 

Sorry I&amp;#39;m not trying to spam but I&amp;#39;m not sure what the best board to ask this would be. Definitely not spy! 

Finally, yes of course I plan to add apple. $200 by 2Q 2023 imo! </td>

You have to be mentally strong to buy and hold through days, weeks, and months of red. This could be the start of a long bear market, maybe not but no one knows. Staying properly hedged and selling CCs has saved my portfolio in the short term. Invest what you can afford and don’t go all in on one stock. Good luck to all and enjoy these discounts.

Weird how Tom lee said it was headed to 500 when it was 470,s then said February would be a violent move up and yet 🤷🏽‍♂️ nope. As I told everyone Cramer pumped bear sterns before the 2008 crash, $JPM pumped $AAPL before the first part of this crash and little ol me made clear the market would hit this level and to ignore cnbc and it’s cronies and buy inverse buy $UVXY and you will bank. @OldFngGuy and others kept pumping u to buy the dip and we’re very cocky when markets were ripping higher with fed pump and yet I said multiple times I reiterate that the market will hit 389-419 around year end and on every pump since I maintained to add to inverse as the market will drop. All those cocky folks got destroyed buying the dip when they could have been banking big as usual simply listening to me. Once that 420 breaks it’s headed for the 406 gap at minimum if no good news saves it $QQQ </td>

Why would you pay over $50 a share (pre-split)? It’s a car company, it might be growing now but eventually growth comes to an end. Ask Ford, they only have been growing for over 100 yrs and sold half a billion cars. When you get too big, your bills also grow with you. Pension funds have to be paid (for many and for life), unions will drag you down and you start selling debt. All while less and less people will be driving in a crowded planet in the future. Please wake up. This is not an investment. Buy at $20 and sell at $25. This is my price target in 10 years. </td>

Tesla: 5.5B 

Lol 5.8% the net income… 😬

PeE ratio will get slashed soon… easy $600 median 🎯 pullback… $500 in the Rhelm of possibility

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA I believe this stock will end up trading at pre-pandemic levels, which is typical after the bubble pops.  However, what excerbated this particular stock bubble was Musk.  I think most people would agree that his conduct these 36 months as it related to the stock was clearly illegal and intended to manipulate his company&amp;#39;s share price.  Last year Musk sold over $30 billion worth of stock and paid approximately $10 billion in income taxes.  If you think he some how cares about climate change, the environment, wildlife, etc., not a chance.  It is clear that his greed for more money is insatiable. To prove my point, he set up a compensation that despite pocketing net $20 billion last year, he was left with more shares than before. Based on my previous employment many years ago, I personally believe that he will be prosecuted. It is a no-brainer at this point based on Musk&amp;#39;s recent behavior. His egregious conduct of seeking to manipulate the value of his company&amp;#39;s shares was blatant. </td>

 😂 the conspiracy bozos are taking over the board. 

This isn’t Russia or Putin.  On March 15th 2020 the Fed panicked and gave the markets record QE with a heavy helping of ZIRP which caused HUGE inflation in the markets hence the insane valuation this ticker and others got.   Look at the rally this stock had after that date; coincidence? Nope!

Now inflation is hitting everyone in the pocket and the only way to fix it is to increase rates and QT which is going to reduce equities in the same way that QE ran them up. 

It’s the medicine the market needs so learn to deal with it. </td>
