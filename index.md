   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Futures Flat After Market Rout </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures were little changed on Friday after Wall Street sold off in the previous session on recurring geopolitical concerns. Futures contracts tied to the major indices swung between small gains and losses. In regular trading on Thursday, the Dow fell 1.78% for its biggest daily drop since November. The S&amp;P 500 lost 2.12% and the Nasdaq declined 2.88%. Investors were kept on edge amid ongoing tensions in Eastern Europe, after Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists of attacking a village near the border. US president Joe Biden also said that the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine remains high in the coming days and that Russia had not in fact pulled back troops out of Ukraine. On the monetary policy front, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, a noted hawk, warned that inflation could get out of control without rate hikes. The major averages are on track for their second negative week in a row. </td>

And if that is unsuccessful, Mr Trump may decline to answer the questions, as his son Eric Trump did under similar circumstances in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                       , That's what the former president's lawyers are already recommending. Having their client sit for what would surely be a multi-hour grilling by New York lawyers looking for verbal missteps or contradictory assertions is not their idea of sound legal strategy.                                                                                                         , This is far from the end of the line, but it still was a rough day for the former president. This civil case, and the criminal probe in Manhattan, aren't going away anytime soon. And having a judge, in a written order, say that there is "copious evidence of fraud" isn't a good look - particularly for a man who likes to boast of his unparalleled business acumen., The investigation, which was opened in 2019, aims to prove the government's claims that Mr Trump inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. The fraud is alleged to have taken place before he took office.                                                                                                                                             , Attorneys for Mr Trump had attempted to sue Ms James in a bid to prevent her from questioning the former president and his children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Ms James hailed the judge's decision as a victory, saying that "justice has prevailed".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , In court, attorneys for Mr Trump argued that testifying in the civil case would improperly allow the state to circumvent a law that bars prosecutors from calling someone to testify before a criminal grand jury unless they are granted immunity.                                                                                                                        , "If she [Ms James] wants sworn testimony from my client, he's entitled to immunity," Mr Trump's defence attorney, Ronald Fischetti said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "He gets immunity for what he says, or he gets nothing".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A fresh perspective on how Hitler brutally seized and kept power                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Get ready for the final series with this sneak peek                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Zara McDermott investigates the impact of revenge porn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Â© 2022 BBC.

But it is not a requirement, and some companies separate productions into zones, with different testing and social distancing requirements depending on how closely casts and crews need to work together., Face covering requirements also will vary, the academy said. Nominees and their guests will be seated in the orchestra and parterre areas of the Dolby Theater and will not be required to wear masks. These attendees will be seated with more spacing than usual. The Dolby seats 3,317 people and 2,500 people will be invited, the academy said.                                                                                        , Those in the mezzanine may be required to wear masks, as they will sit shoulder-to-shoulder. Infections are declining rapidly in Los Angeles County, and the academy said it was consulting with government officials, infectious disease experts and an independent vendor, Cosmos Health Solutions, on a policy.                                                                                                                          , Last week, following a report in The Hollywood Reporter that the academy was planning to forgo a vaccine mandate across the board, the organization was pummeled on social media by fans, stars, politicians and others for what appeared to be an effort to accommodate unvaccinated celebrities. Seth MacFarlane, who hosted the Oscars in 2013, was among those who criticized the academy on Twitter.                                   , The academy declined to say anything publicly about The Hollywood Reporterâs article, but officials insisted that no decisions had been made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Coronavirus safety protocols have been changing rapidly as infections have declined. On Tuesday, Disney eased its mask mandate for fully vaccinated theme park visitors in California and Florida. This week, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival said attendees (up to 125,000 fans a day in the prepandemic era) would not be required to be vaccinated, tested or masked.                                                       , According to government data, 1,713 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized in Los Angeles County as of Thursday, a 54 percent decline since Feb. 1. Over the last week, the county has reported an average of about 4,100 new cases per day, a decline of 77 percent from two weeks ago.                                                                                                                                           , The academyâs decision puts it at odds with some award shows that are scheduled to take place in the weeks before the Oscars, including the Critics Choice Awards on March 13. Joey Berlin, the force behind the awards, told The Hollywood Reporter that everyone involved would be vaccinated. âI canât invite people to a show where theyâre not going to feel safe,â he said.                                                           , The academy emphasized on Thursday that it would be in direct touch with nominees and studios to walk them through the various safety requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The core consumer price index in Japan, which excludes fresh food but includes fuel costs, increased 0.2% in January 2022 over the same month in the previous year, slowing from a 0.5% rise in the preceding month and missing forecasts for a 0.3% increase. The data has posted a year-on-year increase every month since September, but Januaryâs growth marked the slowest rise in three months. Japanâs core inflation rate, which will be among the factors the Bank of Japan will consider in its next policy meeting scheduled at the middle of March, remains well below the central bankâs 2% target. The moderate price increases in the worldâs third-largest economy contrasted with sharp gains in other advanced economies, as sluggish wage growth discourages firms from hiking prices in Japan. </td>

Cost moderated for housing (0.3% vs 0.7% in December), culture &amp; recreation (0.6% vs 3.9%), and  miscellaneous (1.1% vs 1.3%). In addition, prices dropped further for transport (-7.5% vs -7.5%), medical care (-0.1% vs -0.1%), and furniture and household utensils (-0.6% vs -0.8%). By contrast, food inflation stayed at a 16-month high (at 2.1%), while education inflation was unchanged (at 1.2%). Meantime, prices rose faster for both clothes &amp; footwear (1.3% vs 0.3%), fuel, light and water charges (12.7% vs 11.2%), Core consumer prices gained 0.2% yoy, the least in three months, after a 0.5% rise in December, missing market forecasts of 0.3% and remaining well below the BoJâs 2% target. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold increased to a 36-week high of 1901 USD/t.oz,  extending its upward momentum to levels not seen since June of 2021, as mounting tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine lifted bullion's safe-haven appeal.  NATO said it had not seen Russia pulling back troops from Ukraine's borders, while Russian news reported mortars fired in eastern Ukraine. Aside from safe-haven bids, minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting showed policymakers might not be as hawkish as investors feared. On top of that, a disappointing US jobless claims report has supercharged existing bullish momentum for the yellow metal. </td>

Having borders closed isn't logical anymore because Omicron is in society," the Malaysian low-cost carrier's chief executive said.                                                                       , "Now we have to protect people's livelihoods and economies," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Like most airlines around the world, AirAsia reported a massive loss in 2020. But while low-cost international carriers in Europe and North America enjoyed a rebound in 2021 as travel rules were relaxed, Asian airlines slumped even further.                  , Ireland's Ryanair, for example, more than tripled its year-on-year revenue in the third quarter of 2021. In the same period, AirAsia's dropped by a third.                                                                                                        , According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Asia-Pacific was the only region in the world that failed to register any significant improvement in air traffic by the end of 2021.                                                             , While some Asian countries, such as China and Japan have completely sealed off their borders to outsiders, others like Singapore have made tentative moves into less restrictive travel through selected Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs).                          , It guarantees virtually quarantine-free entry into Singapore, but flights are limited and often more expensive.                                                                                                                                                   , Other similar schemes in the region - designed to encourage tourism - involve extensive paperwork as well as multiple costly Covid tests and short periods of compulsory isolation.                                                                               , "To me, opening our borders means no quarantine, no form-filling, no constant testing," Mr Fernandes said.                                                                                                                                                        , "It's time to move on and get on with our lives," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In spite of the continued restrictions, the return of the Singapore Airshow was hailed by many as a sign of confidence in the region's aviation industry.                                                                                                         , All of the world's biggest aerospace players were in attendance and most were cautiously optimistic that 2022 will be a better year for Asia.                                                                                                                     , "We let governments here take the lead and we follow their pace", said Ted Colbert, the US-based chief executive of Boeing Global Services. "But we're prepared for a comeback and we're excited about that happening."                                           , "We're expecting inter-regional travel to come back soon and for the full market to return to normal by 2023 or 2024," he added.                                                                                                                                  , But regional industry experts say a lot more needs to be done to ensure the industry's full recovery in the short-term, especially when it comes to building a more cohesive travel policy between governments.                                                   , "Each country in Asia sets its own rules, often fast-changing rules, which makes it risky and complicated for travellers," Henk Ombelet from aviation analysts Cirium said. "So it ends up that most opt to just not travel, or at most just travel domestically.", The uncertainty surrounding snap restrictions, or potential new virus variants, means that passenger services have become a less reliable source of income for companies in the long-term.                                                                        , Mr Colbert highlights Boeing's increasing focus on air cargo, something that has been accelerated by high shipping costs and which he says is forecast to grow by 70% by 2040.                                                                                    , Meanwhile, AirAsia moved into new businesses, including food delivery, digital banking and e-commerce, while many of its planes remained grounded.                                                                                                                , To reflect this change the airline's parent company last month changed its name from AirAsia Group to Capital A.                                                                                                                                                  , But Mr Fernandes denies the shift into different areas shows a lack of confidence in AirAsia's core business.                                                                                                                                                     , "People will always need to fly. At the moment people are desperate to spend a weekend in Phuket or Langkawi or wherever. When borders fully open, there's going to be a lot of 'revenge travel'."                                                                , "I believe this is the beginning of the end. I'm aware I've said that a few times before, but I do believe we're on the road to recovery."                                                                                                                        , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A fresh perspective on how Hitler brutally seized and kept power                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Get ready for the final series with this sneak peek                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Zara McDermott investigates the impact of revenge porn                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Â© 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Stock futures were flat in overnight trading Thursday following the Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst day of 2022 as investors dumped risk assets amid geopolitical concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                 , Futures on the blue-chip Dow were up by 30 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures both edged 0.1% higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Wall Street suffered a steep sell-off on Wednesday, with the Dow falling more than 600 points for its biggest daily drop since end of November. The S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 2% to break a two-day winning streak, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.9%.                                                                                                    , Investors continued to be on edge about the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists ofÂ attacking a villageÂ near the border. In the U.S., meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was headed to the United Nations to make an urgent appeal against an invasion.                                                , "A further escalation of tensions in the near term could roil markets due to the potential impact on a tenuous global supply chain, particularly as the Fed prepares for its first-rate hike in years," said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network. "A perfect storm may be on the horizon if calmer heads don't prevail.", Investors have been grappling with the outlook for Federal Reserve policy. St. Louis Fe President James Bullard, who had just called for aggressive action, warned that inflation could get out of control without rate hikes.                                                                                                                                   , Major averages are on pace for their second negative week in a row. The Dow is down 1.2% week to date, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have fallen 0.9% and 0.5% this week, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                       , "Wall Street is feeling very jittery as it looks to the left and sees intensifying geopolitical risks with the Ukraine situation and then it looks to the right and sees the potential for aggressive Fed tightening,"Â Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a note.                                                                              , RokuÂ shares dropped as much as 12% in extended trading after the video-streaming company reported a revenue miss and issued a weaker-than-expected guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Got a confidential news tip?

"During testing in our Sturgis, Mich., facility, we found evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the plant in non-product contact areas. We found no evidence of Salmonella Newport. This investigation is ongoing," Abbott said. "Importantly, no distributed product has tested positive for the presence of either of these bacteria, and we continue to test." Despite detecting no pathogens, the company is recalling powder formulas manufactured in the plant with an expiration of April 1, 2022 or after, it said. The recall does not affect Abbott liquid formulas, powder formulas, or nutrition products from other facilities, Abbott said. "We're taking this action so parents know they can trust us to meet our high standards, as well as theirs. We deeply regret the concern and inconvenience this situation will cause parents, caregivers and health care professionals," said Joe Manning, executive VP of nutritional products.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on Canada's 10-year government bond eased to 1.92% after hitting a three-year high of 1.995% on February 16th, as heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine reignited a rush to safer investments such as government bonds. President Biden reiterated a warning that Russia could invade Ukraine in the coming days. Earlier, NATO had stated it had not seen Russia pulling back troops from Ukraine's borders, while Russian backed separatists and government forces accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules. On the data front, Canadaâs annual inflation rate climbed to a 30-year high of 5.1% in January, adding more pressure on the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates during the next monetary policy meeting in March, which should be followed by five more hikes through the rest of the year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canadaâs main stock index, the S&amp;P/TSX, closed 1% lower at 21,176 on Thursday, the lowest in two weeks amid a rout in global equities, as losses in tech and energy stocks more than offset gains in materials and utilities. Market sentiment continued to be dominated by geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, while protests in Ottawa and new quarterly results also weighed. Russian backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and government forces have accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules, lifting appetite for safe-haven assets. Meanwhile, police officers started distributing warnings to truckers participating in Ottawaâs blockade, as imminent police action is expected to bring an end to the three-week old protest. Earlier, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had sharpened his tone against the movement, calling it âa threatâ to Canadaâs democracy.

        SHAK,
        -4.55%
       headed more than 6% lower in the extended session Thursday after the fast-casual restaurant reported a fourth-quarter loss that was greater than Wall Street expected and said the timing of a full recovery is still uncertain. Shake Shack said it lost $9.7 million, or 25 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $19.4 million, or 50 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company lost 11 cents a share in the quarter. Revenue rose 29% to $203.3 million, the company said. Analysts polled by FactSet expected a loss of 18 cents a share on sales of $203 million. Digital sales, including orders placed on the Shake Shack app, website and third-party delivery platforms, represented 42% of sales, the company said. Shake Shack guided for first-quarter revenue between $196 million and $201.4 million, and said it would not provide full-year guidance due to "uncertainty and resulting material economic impact" caused by the pandemic. "The timing of a return to pre-COVID sales levels is highly dependent upon the return of the high-traffic areas that contributed to many of the strongest Shack sales, including those most reliant on travel, schools, offices and major gatherings. The timing of that recovery remains unknown today," it said. Shake Shack stock ended the regular trading day down 4.6%. , Nvidia Corp. provided a strong forecast despite supply constraints Wednesday, after doubling profits and producing record sales in the holiday quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks in a wide-ranging interview on 'Cavuto: Coast-to-Coast,' explains markets, crypto investing, the potential for increased taxes and how the Biden administration is handling the U.S. economy.                                                                                                                                                                                       , With millions of Americans expecting a tax refund this year, the IRS has one request for those looking to get their money faster: File your return electronically and as soon as possible.Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Nearly three-quarters of filers received a tax refund last year, with an average payment of about $2,800, the IRS said recently â a major influx of money for most households that many Americans depend on. Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , IRS TAX-FILING SEASON TO KICK OFF ON JAN. 24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The IRS is already warning of a "challenging" tax season that promises to bring complications and potential delays for taxpayers. That's largely due to the deluge of unprocessed paper returns the agency is working its way through: At the end of December, the IRS had 6 million unprocessed individual returns â a significant increase from its usual backlog of about 1 million unprocessed returns around the beginning of tax season., For taxpayers who choose to file their returns via mail, there could be as long as a four-week wait to retrieve your payment status on the site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , There are some steps that taxpayers can take in order to get their money back faster. Experts have urged taxpayers to file their tax returns as soon as possible, noting that individuals do not need previous returns in order to submit their 2021 returns. Americans are encouraged to file electronically with direct deposit in order to avoid potential delays and receive their return within 21 days.                                 , If you file electronically â as most taxpayers do â you can start tracking the status of your tax refund within 24 hours of filing using the IRS' Whereâs My Refund tool. Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , However, for taxpayers who choose to file their returns via mail, there could be as long as a four-week wait to retrieve your payment status on the site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Still, many taxpayers wind up waiting far longer than 21 days for their refund â and it's often due to simple math mistakes on their tax returns or identity theft delays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at online financial adviser Betterment, said Americans should file their returns as soon as they're ready in order to help avoid tax fraud, because there's a "huge problem" where fraudsters find someone's Social Security number, illegally file a return on their behalf and claim the refund.Â                                                                                                              , "The best way to mitigate someone illegally filing a return on your behalf is to file as soon as possible and to get ahead of the game," Bronnenkant said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig testifies during a Senate Finance Committee hearing June 8, 2021, on Capitol Hill.Â  (Tom Williams-Pool/Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , There are fresh challenges facing the IRS â and individual filers â this year: Taxpayers will have to reflect the monthly child tax credit payments and the stimulus checks they received in 2021 on their returns, further complicating matters and increasing the likelihood of errors and delays in processing returns.                                                                                                                    , "Any time you get a tax credit, and you need to reconcile that when you file, you want to make sure you put the correct number down when you file, otherwise that may delay your return and your refund that you might otherwise be entitled to," Bronnenkant said. "Knowing what payments you got up front and appropriately recording those will go far in reducing some of the friction in filing."                                        , Families that received monthly installments of the boosted child tax credit last year will receive a letter â called Letter 6419 â from the IRS informing them of the total amount of the advanced payment they received and the number of qualifying children used to calculate the payments.                                                                                                                                                , Because at least half of the enhanced credit will be paid out as a lump sum when parents receive their 2021 tax return, recipients should keep the letter and use it to accurately reconcile the credit they already received when filing their taxes this year. The information is pertinent to determining how much more money families receive from the credit when they fill out Schedule 8812 and Form 1040.                             , IRS headquarters in Washington on April 13, 2014 (AP Photo/J.

"We urge people to carefully review their taxes for accuracy before filing. And they should file electronically with direct deposit if at all possible; filing a paper tax return this year means an extended refund delay."                      , If taxpayers file an electronic return with no issues and opt to receive the refund via direct deposit, the IRS anticipates the money will arrive within 21 days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , GET FOX BUSINESS ONÂ THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The tax-filing season will end on April 18 this year for most individuals, rather than the usual deadline of April 15, because that's when Emancipation Day will be observed in Washington, D.C. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> U.S. stock benchmarks closed sharply lower Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumping more than 600 points, amid renewed worries that Russia may soon invade Ukraine. The Dow

The Dow's 1.8% slide was its largest daily drop since Nov. 30, according to Dow Jones Market Data. , U.S. stock indexes fall modestly at Thursday's start of regular trade, as investors wrestle with the threat of military conflict between Ukraine and Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Stocks Close at 3-Week Lows </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US securities deepened losses to close around three-week lows on Thursday, with the Dow Jones ending 623 points lower, the S&amp;P 500 dropping 2.1%, and the Nasdaq slipping 2.5%, as war woes in Eastern Europe intensified after President Biden reiterated a warning that Russia could invade Ukraine in the coming days. Earlier, NATO had stated it had not seen Russia pulling back troops from Ukraine's borders, while Russian news reported mortars fired in eastern Ukraine. As risk-aversion weighed down on bond yields, banking stocks fell, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, which had released upbeat forward guidance. On the other side earnings from Walmart, Cisco and Applied Materials topped expectations. Traders also digested fresh economic data, with initial claims unexpectedly rising last week and housing starts falling much more than expected. </td>

If the project is successful, Mr. Pichai said, he hopes it will be a âtemplate for other companies to do moreâ and show policymakers that there are better-performing alternatives to traditional government training efforts.                                                             , The tech giant is working with three nonprofit groups on the effort: Year Up, which focuses on upward mobility programs for the disadvantaged; Merit America, an organization that offers tech training programs for adults without a bachelorâs degree; and Social Finance, which designs student-friendly financing and repayment plans.                                                                                                                                  , The training organizations are paid a portion of their costs upfront and receive additional payments only if their graduates land and keep higher-paying jobs. The program will combine Google philanthropy with loan repayments from students. The loans will carry no interest, and students will begin repaying only if they get a job that pays at least $40,000 a year. The payments will be about $100 a month and continue for a maximum of five years.              , The Google fund will pay to start and support the program, since not all students will graduate and secure higher-paying jobs. But loan repayments from successful students will help support training for others in the future. The Google fund hopes to fuel total wage gains of $1 billion for 20,000 training program graduates.                                                                                                                                        , The three organizations working with Google are indicative of newer trends in job training and hiring. They focus on results â graduates getting higher-paying jobs â rather than numbers of people passing through their programs. They are advocates for hiring based on demonstrated skills instead of screening by college degrees. And they are all experimenting with ways to make programs more self-sufficient financially and less dependent on charitable support., âThis is a really serious effort to put philanthropic money into programs that have the elements that have proved effective,â said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard University.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The job programs, Year Up and Merit America, will receive grants to train students in technical skills with content from Google career certificate courses in information technology support, data analytics, project management and user experience design. Both nonprofits already use the Google coursework, which provides general technical training but does not teach students to master Google software tools.                                                      , But a major part of successful training programs, experts agree, is what they do beyond teaching technical skills. The programs also emphasize so-called soft skills like teamwork, communication and willingness to learn new things. They often provide help with arranging child care and transportation. They have career coaches, social workers and counselors, and foster peer groups and alumni networks.                                                           , âSkills and competencies are important, but so is building up a personâs social capital,â said Gerald Chertavian, founder and chief executive of Year Up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Begun more than two decades ago, Year Up is now a national organization that caters to low-income workers from 18 to 26 years old. It includes three to six months of technical training followed by a six-month internship at a company. Eighty percent of its graduates are placed in jobs within four months, at an average starting salary of $44,000, more than double their previous income, the organization says.                                                   , Social Finance, which is managing the investment program, is looking to add a few more job training groups this year. An independent research firm, MDRC, will evaluate the performance of the training and job placement programs over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , âWeâll allocate more funds to whoever is delivering better results,â said Tracy Palandjian, chief executive of Social Finance, which is not related to the online lender SoFi. âItâs all about impact.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Merit America has grown rapidly since it began offering courses in 2018. From the outset, it was a hybrid program, with self-paced online training, in-person meetings once a week with fellow students and one-on-one sessions with coaches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , So when the pandemic shutdowns hit, Merit America was well placed to make the shift to remote training. It is growing rapidly â on track to reach 2,500 students this year, more than double the number in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Google-fund backing âputs jet fuel in our engine, allowing us to scale up as never before,â said Connor Diemand-Yauman, one of the founders of Merit America, where he is co-chief executive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Merit America participants span demographics, but they are typically in their early 30s, with a decade or more of working experience, often in low-paid jobs in restaurants and retail. The program includes three months of skills and workplace training, followed by a job-placement phase of a few months.                                                                                                                                                              , Merit Americaâs graduation rate is more than 80 percent, and nearly all the graduates are getting jobs, the program says. Graduate starting salaries now average more than $45,000, at least $18,000 more than before the program. Both salaries and wage gains have been rising with recent cohorts.                                                                                                                                                                       , The nonprofit is financed largely by philanthropy and repayments on no-interest loans from graduates in higher-paying jobs, which is the model being adopted for the Google fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Sandra Massie, a single mother in Virginia, had worked for nine years in restaurant jobs when she saw an online ad for Merit America. The skills training was based on the Google IT support certificate course, which she completed online while still working at a restaurant chain.                                                                                                                                                                                      , But, Ms. Massie said, the peer learning with students from similar backgrounds and one-on-one sessions with coaches were crucial. âItâs a network of support that really gets you believing that this type of change is possible in your life,â she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , With the nonprofitâs help, Ms. Massie got a job offer in 2019, before she finished her training. She now works for a software consulting firm, Intact Technology, and is transitioning from a tech support role to managing small-team projects for clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Today, Ms. Massie, 34, earns $75,000 a year, about twice as much as in her last restaurant job. She has health care and vacation time, and the company contributes to her 401(k) retirement plan. She has set up a college savings plan for her 9-year-old daughter and owns a home.                                                                                                                                                                                        , âMy life has changed a lot,â Ms. Massie said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Elon Musk says US is trying to 'chill' his free speech </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tesla boss Elon Musk has accused US regulators of targeting him for "unrelenting investigation" because of his criticism of the government.                                                                                             , In a court filing, the billionaire says the Securities and Exchange Commission has engaged in "outsized efforts" to monitor the firm that "seem calculated to chill his exercise" of free speech.                                       , The letter heightens the battle between Mr Musk and financial regulators over his social media activity.                                                                                                                                , His Twitter posts often move markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In 2018, the SEC ordered Mr Musk to submit to increased oversight of his posts about Tesla as part of a settlement into claims that he misled investors in 2018 with a post about taking the electric car company private.              , The SEC has repeatedly raised questions since about Mr Musk running afoul of the agreement, in which Mr Musk agreed to give Tesla officials pre-approval of posts about the company.                                                    , In November, regulators subpoenaed the firm, requesting information about its governance processes related to the order.                                                                                                                , That month, Mr Musk asked his more than 70 million Twitter followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla shares, driving shares lower.                                                                                              , In the letter to Judge Alison Nathan, who is overseeing the 2018 settlement, the billionaire's attorney Alex Spiro accused regulators of "weaponizing the consent decree by using it to try to muzzle and harass Mr. Musk and Tesla".   , "The SEC seems to be targeting Mr. Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr. Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government," he wrote on behalf of Mr Musk and Tesla.                                       , "The SEC's outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights rather than to enforce generally applicable laws in even-handed fashion".                                                                   , He said the SEC had opened "serial investigations" without seeking guidance from the court and that the agency was overdue to distribute to investors the $40m in penalties it collected as part of the 2018 settlement.                , The SEC declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Mr Musk's Twitter musings on topics from Tesla to crypto currency have frequently appeared to move market prices.                                                                                                                       , He has used his perch to criticise the SEC, saying oversight at the agency was "broken".                                                                                                                                                , Mr Musk has also criticised US President Joe Biden for not acknowledging the contributions of SpaceX or Tesla, most recently dismissing the president as a "damp [sock emoji] puppet".                                                  , But Professor James D Cox, who teaches corporate and securities law at Duke University, said the SEC is responding to Mr Musk's decision to repeatedly flout a court order, not his other antics.                                       , Executives at publicly traded companies are bound by protocols governing disclosure of information, he said.                                                                                                                            , "This isn't a question of the SEC targeting him," he said. "They're doing it because he is brazenly ignoring the order of the SEC that has the imprimatur of the federal court system."                                                 , In addition to the financial regulator's subpoena, Tesla faces a racial discrimination lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and a safety probe from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration., A fresh perspective on how Hitler brutally seized and kept power                                                                                                                                                                        , Get ready for the final series with this sneak peek                                                                                                                                                                                     , Zara McDermott investigates the impact of revenge porn                                                                                                                                                                                  , Â© 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Equities Extend Losses on War Jitters </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US equity securities extended losses towards the end of Thursdayâs session, with the Dow Jones erasing almost 600 points, the S&amp;P 500 dropping as much as 1.9%, and the Nasdaq slipping over 2.5%, as war woes in Eastern Europe intensified after President Biden reiterated a warning that Russia could invade Ukraine in the coming days. Earlier, NATO had stated it had not seen Russia pulling back troops from Ukraine's borders, while Russian news reported mortars fired in eastern Ukraine. As risk-aversion weighed down on bond yields, banking stocks fell, including Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, which had released upbeat forward guidances. Among other earnings, Walmart, Cisco and Applied Materials topped expectations. Traders also digest fresh economic data, with initial claims unexpectedly rising last week and housing starts falling much more than expected. </td>

The Fed is watching carefully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , By Jeanna Smialek                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Amazon, Bank of America and Chipotle are among a spate of companies raising wages this year as they compete for workers in a labor market with more open positions than unemployed job seekers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But that positive development for workers could morph into a challenge for the Federal Reserve if climbing wages help to keep inflation high, prompting employees to ask for even more money and generating an upward spiral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , So far, many economists think such a situation can be kept at bay. But the Fed is closely monitoring inflation and pay data to assess the risk, because the consequences if wages and prices begin to drive each other steadily higher could be serious, requiring a response from the central bank that could be economically painful.                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Fed is already poised to raise interest rates in March in an attempt to begin cooling off the economy as inflation runs at its fastest pace in 40 years. But if it needed to restrain a self-perpetuating burst in wages and prices, officials might decide to adjust policy more drastically. Higher interest rates could abruptly hit the brakes on lending and spending, potentially sending the United States into recession and foiling central bankersâ hopes of guiding growth gently toward a more sustainable path., âI think weâre much more likely to have something messier than a magical soft landing,â said Olivier Blanchard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. âThe wage evolutions are going to be the thing to look at.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Wages are already rising sharply. Pay for restaurant servers and hotel workers began to increase notably in 2021 as companies, reopening after lockdown, struggled to rehire people quickly. Now a wide array of industries are giving raises: The governmentâs latest employment report showed pay accelerating sharply for education and health workers, manufacturers, and professional and business services.                                                                                                               , Average hourly earnings jumped 5.7 percent in the year through January, a full percentage point more than economists had forecast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Earnings calls are replete with chief executives explaining that they are increasing pay to attract and retain talent. Unions have won pay bargaining fights. And the White House regularly celebrates signs that power in the work force seems to have shifted toward employees and away from employers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , For the most part, thatâs good news for labor. But economists have increasingly warned that the confluence of economic trends shaping up now â high inflation, a sense among consumers that prices might stay high for a while and a strong labor market that has handed workers bargaining power â could set the stage for a situation in which wage growth and prices feed off each other.                                                                                                                                    , âThe combination of very high inflation, hot wage growth and high short-term inflation expectations means that concerns about falling into a wage-price spiral deserve to be taken seriously,â Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , That would be a big shift. America has not experienced a wage-price spiral since the 1970s and early 1980s, when rapid inflation and skyrocketing wages seemed to perpetuate each other. The Fed lifted interest rates to double digits and caused a painful recession to bring prices under control. Both wage growth and inflation have been slow in the decades since â until now.                                                                                                                                           , But even if wages and prices are both rising now, it is not clear that they are egging each other on yet, which is a crucial distinction. In fact, labor market experts point out three big reasons to doubt that a wage-price spiral will happen today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Chief among them: Productivity growth looks strong. If each individual worker can churn out more goods and services, companies should be able to pay more without hurting their profit margins and leading them to pass along the higher costs. Nick Bunker, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said recent productivity data was an encouraging sign but not a definitive one.                                                                                                                                             , âItâs really hard to observe in real time,â he said of the data, noting that the numbers jump around a lot. âI think itâs something to keep an eye on.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , It is also unclear just how much wage bargaining power employees have, even with employers eager to hire. Wage growth appears to have been falling behind price increases for many income groups in recent months, suggesting that workers arenât managing to persuade their companies to compensate them fully for rising costs. Unionization is much lower than in the 1970s, which could leave workers with fewer tools to bargain up pay.                                                                                   , If that begins to crimp consumersâ ability to buy new couches and cars, it could cause demand to moderate, naturally restraining inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , And the tie between wages and prices has been tenuous in recent decades. While research has found a link between the two in the 1960s and 1970s, the relationship collapsed after the early 1980s and has remained tame since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , âThe relationship between wage growth and services inflation just isnât that tight,â said Laura Rosner-Warburton, an economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives. âYes, you will see more inflation from wages in 2022. The question is how much?â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , While a wage-price spiral is on a âlarge list of risk factorsâ that the administration is closely watching, the âdominant forecastâ is that the labor market will stay strong and price gains will moderate this year, said Jared Bernstein, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Wall Street economists generally think inflation will fade toward 3 percent this year, based on recent analyst notes and interviews. A recent survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that consumers, who had been penciling in higher inflation in the years ahead, have begun to lower their expectations for price increases.                                                                                                                                                                                , But several forecasters said there was room for humility and wariness, because the pandemic economy has repeatedly confounded expectations.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago wheat futures bounced back above to $7.9 per bushel, near a two-week high of $8.1 hit earlier in the week amid heightened tensions in Eastern Europe. Russian backed separatists and government forces accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules, reigniting fears of an imminent war between two of the worldâs biggest wheat exporters while it could augur well for US wheat. Additionally, low inventories in Canada and in the US, the third and second-largest exporters globally, added to upside risks. Total stocks of wheat in Canada were 38% down on the year at the end of 2021, as yields were poor due to drought in farms in the Prairie region. Droughts also hampered US production with sales and exports in the week ending February 3rd totaling 17.3 million tonnes, 21% lower than USDA projections of 22.05 million tonnes. </td>

        KKR,
        -5.87%.
       While most of the eight sub-sets of the credit market turned in positive total returns for 2021, only two of the eight were positive in January: European bank loans (up 0.35% in total return) and U.S. bank loans (up 0.36%). Asia high yield credit had the worst January results with a negative 4.81% return. Overall, CCC-rated bonds have held up well in the face of volatility, KKR said. "In January, while broader credit markets started to weaken under pressure, CCCs, the perceived riskiest part of the market, weathered the storm best," KKR said. CCC-rated bonds outperformed equities in January, KKR said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Copper futures traded around $4.5 per pound, trimming gains from earlier this week, as traders weighed geopolitical risks in Eastern Europe against reports of tight inventories and supply issues.

Still, stocks held in LME-approved warehouses declined to 70,125 tonnes, the lowest since November 2005, capping losses. On the supply side, MMG Ltd said production at its Las Bambas copper mine in Peru may stop by February 20th after a local community blocked again a road used by the miner, causing the company to curtail operations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The BA.2 virus -- a subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant -- isn't just spreading faster than its distant cousin, it may also cause more severe disease and appears capable of thwarting some of the key weapons we have against Covid-19, new research suggests.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , New lab experiments from Japan show that BA.2 may have features that make it as capable of causing serious illness as older variants of Covid-19, including Delta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , And like Omicron, it appears to largely escape the immunity created by vaccines. A booster shot restores protection, making illness after infection about 74% less likely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , BA.2 is also resistant to some treatments, including sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody that's currently being used against Omicron.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The findings were posted Wednesday as a preprint study on the bioRxiv server, before peer review. Normally, before a study is published in medical journal, it is scrutinized by independent experts. Preprints allow research to be shared more quickly, but they are posted before that additional layer of review.                                                                                                                                                                  , "It might be, from a human's perspective, a worse virus than BA.1 and might be able to transmit better and cause worse disease," says Dr. Daniel Rhoads, section head of microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Rhoads reviewed the study but was not involved in the research.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , BA.2 is highly mutated compared with the original Covid-causing virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. It also has dozens of gene changes that are different from the original Omicron strain, making it as distinct from the most recent pandemic virus as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were from each other.                                                                                                                                                               , Kei Sato, a researcher at the University of Tokyo who conducted the study, argues that these findings prove that BA.2 should not be considered a type of Omicron and that it needs to be more closely monitored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "As you may know, BA.2 is called 'stealth Omicron,' " Sato told CNN. That's because it doesn't show up on PCR tests as an S-gene target failure, the way Omicron does.  Labs therefore have to take an extra step and sequence the virus to find this variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "Establishing a method to detect BA.2 specifically would be the first thing" many countries need to do, he says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "It looks like we might be looking at a new Greek letter here," agreed Deborah Fuller, a virologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but was not part of the research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mixed real-world data on subvariant's severity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , BA.2 is about 30% to 50% more contagious than Omicron. It has been detected in 74 countries and 47 US states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 4% of Americans with Covid-19 now have infections caused by BA.2, but many other parts of the world have more experience with this variant.  It has become dominant in at least 10 other countries: Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Denmark, Guam, India, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines, according to World Health Organization's weekly epidemiological report.                                   , But, there's mixed evidence on the severity of BA.2 in the real world.  Hospitalizations continue to decline in countries where BA.2 has gained a foothold, like South Africa and the UK.  But in Denmark, where BA.2 has become the leading cause of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are rising, according to WHO.                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Resistant to monoclonal antibody treatments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The new study found that BA.2 can copy itself in cells more quickly than BA.1, the original version of Omicron.  It's also more adept at causing cells to stick together.  This allows the virus to create larger clumps of cells, called syncytia, than BA.1.  That's concerning because these clumps then become factories for churning out more copies of the virus. Delta was also good at creating syncytia, which is thought to be one reason it was so destructive to the lungs., When the researchers infected hamsters with BA.2 and BA.1, the animals infected with BA.2 got sicker and had worse lung function. In tissues samples, the lungs of BA.2-infected hamsters had more damage than those infected by BA.1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Similar to the original Omicron, BA.2 was capable of breaking through antibodies in the blood of people who'd been vaccinated against Covid-19.  It was also resistant to the antibodies of people who'd been infected with Covid-19 early in the pandemic, including Alpha and Delta.  And BA.2 was almost completely resistant to some monoclonal antibody treatments.                                                                                                               , But there was a bright spot:  Antibodies in the blood of people who'd recently had Omicron also seemed to have some protection against BA.2, especially if they'd also been vaccinated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , And that raises an important point, Fuller says.  Even though BA.2 seems more contagious and pathogenic than Omicron, it may not wind up causing a more devastating wave of Covid-19 infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "One of the caveats that we have to think about as we get new variants that might seem more dangerous is the fact that there's two sides to the story," Fuller says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The virus matters, she says, but as its would-be hosts, so do we.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "Our immune system is evolving as well.

In other words, our immunity, be a step ahead of the next variant that comes out, and I don't know that we're quite there yet," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , For that reason, Fuller says, she feels like it's not quite time for communities to lift mask mandates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "Before this thing came out, we were about 10 feet away from the finish line," she said. "Taking off the masks now is not a good idea. It's just going to extend it.

It's not so long since a wife was considered her husband's property and had no legal rights whatsoever. It was only in the 1980s that new laws against marital rape recognised that men didn't have the right to demand sex with their wives anytime they wanted; prior to that, consent was considered to have been given on the wedding day and never revoked. Today, we still live in a society that entrenches women's subordination at every level -- from the home to the boardroom, to our parliament." , "Men don't abuse women because society tells them it's OK," Hill adds. "Men abuse women because society tells them they are entitled to be in control."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But all hope is not lost. As numerous organizations -- and the authors of the Lancet study -- have said, it is possible to prevent intimate partner violence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The RESPECT women framework,which is published by the WHO and supported by 13 other UN agencies and governments, identifies seven broad policy priorities that, taken together, can prevent violence against women.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , They range from the economic and social empowerment of women; the provision of services by the state such as legal, health or social services; and the transformation of societal attitudes towards gender, "male privilege and female subordination" among others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The coronavirus pandemic saw all forms of gender-based violence rise the world over, particularly domestic violence, with women stuck at home with their abusers. But the tragedy of The Lancet report is that the numbers were already high before the pandemic. If the demographics are segmented further, we are bound to find worse rates of violence among certain groups of women -- women with disabilities and those with precarious immigration statuses, to name just two.                                                                                                                  , All eyes now need to be on what our governments are going to do about these galling stats. If they -- and us -- need reminding, as the study's authors confirm, intimate partner violence, and arguably all gender-based violence, "can have major short and long-term impacts on the physical and mental health of the victim, leading to substantial social and economic costs for governments, communities, and individuals".

(1915-1991) alongside three other writers is referred to as "the fourth pillar of modern Urdu fiction", with her work considered by some "the birth of revolutionary feminist politics" with themes that include sexuality and class.

Isabella Thoburn College in 1940, she was part of the Progressive Writers Movement which used Urdu literature to critique social injustice.

works Lihaaf  (The Quilt, 1942) which inspired India's first film about lesbianism, Fire; and Chu Mui (1952), which focuses on how women were regarded as only good to produce heirs.

Lihaaf caused a storm in conservative India. She was summoned to court for obscenity -- an experience she documented in her essay, The Lihaaf Trial. This experience did not, however, deter her from writing about taboo topics such as women's sexual desires, male-dominated interpretations of religion and homoeroticism. She was also an advocate for women's rights to education among other causes.                                                                                                                                                   , Also a filmmaker, Chughtai wrote screenplays, dialogues and songs for films. She produced multiple movies with her director husband, Shaheed Latif, in the 1950s and 60s.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US gasoline futures pulled back below $2.65 a gallon from an over seven-year high of $2.79 reached earlier in the week, amid a broad rout in commodities, as worries over Iranian oil returning to markets more than offset upside risks from geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. Iran was reportedly close to accepting a deal on its nuclear programme, which could mean the release of about 1.3 million barrels a day of crude supply and ease a tight global market. Meanwhile, Russian backed separatists and government forces accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules, reigniting fears of an imminent all-out war. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed's Bullard says inflation 'could get out of control,' so action is needed now </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , NEW YORK â St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard cautioned Thursday that without central bank action on interest rates, inflation could become an even more serious problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "We're at more risk now than we've been in a generation that this could get out of control," he said during a panel talk at Columbia University. "One scenario would be ... a new surprise that hits us that we can't anticipate right now, but we would have even more inflation. That's the kind of situation that we want to ... make sure it doesn't occur."                                                        , Bullard has made news lately with his calls for aggressive Fed action. He has advocated for a full percentage point in rate increases by July in an effort to stem price surges that are running at the fastest pace in 40 years.                                                                                                                                                                                       , In his remarks Thursday, Bullard repeated his assertion that the Fed should "front-load" rate hikes as way to get ahead of inflation running at a 7.5% clip over the past year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Fed officials had been resisting tightening policy, insisting for much of last year that the current run-up in prices was tied to pandemic-specific factors, such as clogged supply chains and outsized demand for goods over services, and would fade over time.                                                                                                                                                       , "Overall, I'd say there's been too much emphasis and too much mindshare devoted to the idea that inflation will dissipate at some point in the future," Bullard said. "We're at risk that inflation won't dissipate, and 2022 will be the second year in a row of quite high inflation. So that's why given this situation, the Fed should move faster and more aggressively than we would have in other circumstances.", The Fed has indicated it likely will start raising interest rates in March, which would be the first increase in more than three years. After that, markets are looking for an additional five or six increases in 25 basis-point increments. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.                                                                                                                                          , Bullard said the upcoming change in policy shouldn't be viewed as an attempt to restrict the markets and the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "It's not tight policy. Don't let anybody tell you it's tight policy," he said. "It's removal of accommodation that will signal that we take our responsibility seriously."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Market pricing for rate hikes has tempered over the past day or two, particularly after a release Wednesday of the January meeting minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee showed officials are looking to take a measured approach toward the removal of policy help.                                                                                                                                             , Traders are now pointing to a 25 basis-point hike in March after previously looking to a 50 basis-point move, according to CME data.

DoorDash reported $1.3 billion in revenue last quarter, beating a Refinitiv estimate of $1.28 billion. The company also posted strong order numbers and added new users, suggesting that demand for food delivery services remains high.                     , Palantir Technologies â Shares of Palantir dropped 15.7% after the company's earnings fell short of forecasts for the fourth quarter, though its revenue beat estimates. Its reported net loss was $156.19 million, wider than the $148.34 million loss seen in the year-earlier period.                                                                                                     , Hasbro â The toymaker saw shares rise 2% after activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management nominated five directors to the company's board. Alta is pushing for Hasbro to spin off its Wizards of the Coast unit and its digital games unit, which include franchise brands like Dungeons and Dragons and Magic: The Gathering. Alta owns a 2.5% stake in Hasbro worth around $325 million., Fastly â The cloud computing company's shares plunged 33.6% on disappointing full year guidance. Fastly reported a fourth quarter loss, though it was narrower than analysts had expected, and revenue beat consensus estimates.                                                                                                                                                             , Nvidia â Shares of the chipmaker fell 7.5% despite the company reporting strong quarterly results. Nvidia noted that its automotive business, which represents a growth market for its chips, had revenue drop 14% to $125 million. It also came under pressure on concerns about its exposure to the cryptocurrency market.                                                                 , Cheesecake Factory â The restaurant chain saw its shares rise 4% before pulling back, despite it reporting earnings that missed analysts' expectations along with increased input costs that negated a beat in revenue. The company is planning a price increase in new menus that could lift prices later this year.                                                                        , Walmart â The retail giant's shares rose 4% after Walmart topped earnings expectations and said it's on track to hit long-term financial targets, calling for adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid single-digits.                                                                                                                                                                   , Tripadvisor â The travel site operator fell 2.5% following an unexpected quarterly loss and a revenue miss. Tripadvisor said it expects the travel market to improve significantly in 2022 following what it called "unexpected periods of virus resurgence" in 2021.                                                                                                                        , Cisco Systems â The software company added 2.7% after it reported a beat on quarterly revenue and earnings and issued an upbeat full-year forecast, citing strong demand from cloud computing companies. Cisco earnings of 84 cents per share beat estimates by 3 cents. Revenue came in at $12.72 billion, versus estimates of $12.65 billion.                                              , Equinix â Digital infrastructure company Equinix gained 2.6% after TD Securities upgraded the stock to buy from hold, citing its recent pullback. The upgrade came a day after the company reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA that beat estimates, as well as a slight revenue beat.                                                                                                    , â CNBC's Yun Li contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Natural Gas Slides 6% </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures erased more than 5% to trade around $4.46/MMBtu on Thursday, slipping from a two-week high of $4.80/MMBtu hit earlier this week after a smaller-than-expected storage draw. The latest EIA data showed that the working gas held in storage facilities in the United States decreased by 190Bcf last week, while markets were expecting it to drop by 193Bcf. Still, forecasts for colder weather and higher heating demand combined with a continued slow return of US production limited losses. Elsewhere, European natural gas prices jumped amid ongoing concerns over tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the possibility that the violence could stop Russian supplies, but global prices have little effect domestically, as US LNG export plants can't transform any more natural gas into LNG. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Ibex 35 Index fell 0.8% to close at 8,671 on Thursday, pressured by geopolitical tensions as fears of imminent military conflict returned. US and NATO authorities said there are signs of additional Russian troops making way to the Ukrainian border and that there is âevery indicationâ that Russia is planning an invasion, including false flag operations as justifications for attacks. At the same time, investors weighed on the minutes of the Fedâs January meeting, pointing to a rate hike in March, although the magnitude is still unclear. On the corporate front, Repsol closed 0.5% lower after posting quarterly results, despite reporting a 70% annual increase in free cash flow operations, largely due to higher oil prices during the year. At the same time, the petrol company announced it plans to allocate 35% of investments until 2025 in low carbon activities, including the sale of its stake in the firmâs newly created renewable energy generation unit. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Eunice: Rare threat-to-life warning issued as back-to-back storms hammer the UK - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Meteorologists in the UK have issued a rare danger-to-life alert as Storm Eunice is forecast to batter parts of the country Friday, potentially creating a "sting jet" that could bring havoc to streets.                                                                                           , On Thursday, the UK's weather service, the Met Office, issued the rare red alert -- the highest weather warning category in the UK -- warning that Eunice is forecast to bring "significant and damaging" gusts of up to 90 mph and threaten life.                                                        , It could also bring high waves and coastal flooding in the west, southwest and south coast of England, the Met Office said.                                                                                                                                                                               , The warnings come as thousands of people remain without power in the UK's north after Storm Dudley brought down trees and cut households from the grid.                                                                                                                                                   , Dudley hit England's north, Scotland's south and Northern Ireland on Wednesday, disrupting railways, roads and businesses with high winds and local flooding.                                                                                                                                             , Peter Inness, a meteorologist at England's University of Reading, said that the back-to-back storms had formed as a result of a strong 200 mph jet steam blowing across the Atlantic Ocean. It is not unusual to see "two or more damaging storms" form in quick succession, he said in a statement.      , But what makes Eunice potentially "rare" and more potent is that it could evolve into a "sting jet" -- a "narrow, focused region of extremely strong winds" amid a "larger area of strong winds."                                                                                                         , The Met Office is urging people to only travel if "necessary" and warned drivers that road closures could be in place on Friday. People across the UK should also secure outdoor furniture and bins, and should avoid parking near trees.                                                                 , Severe storms more frequent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey told CNN he expected Friday's storm to have "high impacts," with flying debris and damage to homes likely.                                                                                                                                                      , "It's developing out in the Atlantic at present, [and] it's heading directly for the UK so to speak," he said. "It will clear out of the UK over the course of Friday and travel towards Denmark and the Scandinavian countries."                                                                         , Vautrey said that, while it was "too early" to say whether storms Dudley and Eunice were "aided by climate change," such strong storms were becoming more common.                                                                                                                                         , "We've definitely seen the frequency of severe weather alter due to climate change," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "Global warming has led to changes in our weather patterns, and that is something we will increasingly have to take note of and be ready to deal with in the future."                                                                                                                                     , Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, warned people not to take the red alert "lightly."                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Red means you need to act now because there is an imminent danger to life," she said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Winds of 70 mph will uproot trees, which can block roads and crush cars or buildings. They can pick up roof tiles and hurl them around.  If you're hit by one of those you will be seriously hurt or killed.  Wind that strong will sweep people and vehicles off streets, and topple electricity lines.", </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The JSE FTSE All Share index was down 0.5% to close at 76,155 at the end of a choppy session on Thursday, led by commodity-linked sectors and financials, as global worries over mounting tensions between Russia and Ukraine more than offset upbeat corporate earnings. On the corporate front, South African miner Gold Fields reported a 20% rise in full-year profit, boosted by higher production and firmer prices, but flagged growing cost pressures. Also, fashion retailer Truworths International reported a 32.2% increase in half-year profit, recovering to pre-COVID 19 levels as lockdown restrictions eased. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cathie Wood says her innovation stocks are 'way undervalued' and recent fund losses temporary </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Cathie Wood of Ark Invest said Thursday the technology companies in her innovation-focused portfolio are drastically undervalued, and she believes that her fund's recent sell-off is short-lived.                                                                                                                   , "We've had a significant decline," Wood said Thursday on CNBC's "Halftime Report." "We do believe innovation is in the bargain basement territory. ... Our technology stocks are way undervalued relative to their potential. ... Give us five years, we're running a deep value portfolio."                         , Her flagship fundÂ Ark Innovation ETFÂ was caught in the epicenter of the tech-driven sell-off in 2022, down 26% year to date. Some of her big holdings, including Zoom, Teladoc Health and Roku, have tumbled as much as 70% this year on expectations of rising interest rates.                                      , "Our biggest concern is that our investors turn what we believe are temporary losses into permanent losses," Wood said.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Higher rates typically punish growth pockets of the market that rely on low rates to borrow for investing in innovation. And their future earnings look less attractive when rates are on the rise.                                                                                                                  , Wood said she doesn't invest in any of those mature Big Tech companies like Microsoft. ARKK bets on companies in the forefront of disruptive technology in a variety of industries from DNA to automation, robotics and artificial intelligence. Her top holdings include Tesla, Exact Sciences, UiPath and Coinbase., "Today we have investors doing the opposite of what they did in the late '90s. They are running for the hills. It's risk-off because of inflation and interest rates. And the hills are their benchmarks. They are running to the past," Wood said.                                                                  , "If we are right and the disruptive innovation that is evolving is going to disintermediate and disrupt the traditional world order, those benchmarks are where the risk is. Not our portfolios," she added.                                                                                                         , Despite the big underperformance, her ARKK has attracted more than $70 million in net inflows year to date, according to FactSet.                                                                                                                                                                                    , The innovation investor said she believes the inflationary drag on growth stocks will end ultimately and that deflationary forces will return.                                                                                                                                                                       , "A lot of what's going on is supply chain related," Wood said. "I do think the deflationary forces building in the economy are pretty strong."                                                                                                                                                                       , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canary CEO Dan Eberhart warns oil and natural gas prices will soar if the situation overseas escalates, especially given 'Europe gets a big portion of its natural gas from Russia.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Dan Eberhart, CEO of drilling services company Canary, argued on Thursday that oil will likely hit $100 a barrel before the summer driving season regardless of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine due to macroeconomic factors and the current inflationary environment.Â                                                                                                                        , He did, however, warn that an invasion would impact oil and natural gas prices and will cause them to go "up, up and away."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Europe gets a big portion of its natural gas from Russia and we will be looking for that to go up as well," Eberhart added.Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Eberhart provided the insight on "Varney &amp; Co." on Thursday as U.S. stocks retreated as investors continue to monitor tensions betweenÂ Russia and Ukraine, as well as theÂ Federal Reserve'sÂ preparation for a March rate hike.Â                                                                                                                                                                        , All three of the major averages fell over 1% with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over 400 points.Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The cost of crude oil and gas began to climb over the past month as Russia added troops to the Ukrainian border.Â On Thursday oil slipped below $90 per barrel.Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin addressed reports of Ukraine and Russian-backed rebels accusing each other of violating a cease-fire after a shelling incident Thursday, stating that the U.S. is monitoring the situation.                                                                                                                                                                            , Sen.

We're still gathering the details, but we've said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict, so we'll be watching this very closely," Austin said.                                                                                                               , The secretary pointed to Russian troops getting closer to the border, additional combat and support aircrafts flying in, activity in the Black Sea, and an increase in blood supplies as evidence that Russia is not withdrawing. Eberhart stressed that regardless of what happens overseas, he believes the macroeconomic factors and the inflationary environment "are going to push oil higher." Â , "I would be shocked if oil doesnât cross $100 before we hit the summer driving season," he continued, adding that he believes "the fundamentals are that $85 or $90 are going to be more than a floor than a ceiling for oil as we move forward even independent of the Russia, Ukrainian situation."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the Swiss 10-year government bond eased to below 0.3% from the 7-year high of 0.35% touched on February 15th, as renewed fears of a Russian invasion in Ukraine increased the demand for safer assets. At the same time, the Swiss National Bank remains committed to its ultra-loose monetary policy, as the latest labor data indicated that unemployment did not increase despite the Covid infection wave in January, while consumer inflation remains moderate. In its latest survey economic survey of Switzerland, the OECD noted that the Swiss economy proved to be very resilient to the ongoing health crisis and should be in no rush to tighten monetary policy. </td>

Blaming inflation on supply lines is like complaining about your sweater keeping you too warm after youâve added several logs to the fireplace," Rattner wrote. "The bulk of our supply problems are the product of an overstimulated economy, not the cause of it."                                                                       , Rattner was referring to comments that Biden made during an interview last week with NBC News' Lester Holt, in which the president said pandemic-induced bottlenecks in the global supply chain were the largest driver of soaring consumer prices. Biden pointed to semiconductor shortages, which have continued to delay car manufacturing and have contributed to a 12.2% annual rise in vehicle costs., A shopper walks through the aisles of the Dollar Tree store in Alhambra, California on December 10, 2021.Â  (Photo by FREDERIC J.

"They were not available."                                                                                               , Although Rattner acknowledged the pandemic has indeed stretched supply chains, he said the primary inflation source is rapid consumer demand, fueled in large part by unprecedented levels of government spending, including three stimulus payments.Â                                                                                                                                                      , On top of that, the pandemic has shifted what Americans are purchasing; as they continue to grapple with the virus, many Americans have shifted their spending to goods like cars, electronics and building materials for homes, rather than travel or entertainment.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Missing girl found under stairs: Inside the search for Paislee Shultis - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Police had gone up and down the basement stairs several times while searching a home in the Saugerties, New York, area Monday for any trace of 6-year-old Paislee Shultis, who had been missing for more than two years.                                                                                                                                      , Roughly an hour and a half into the search, one detective took a closer look at the wooden staircase. "He couldn't put his finger on it, but there was something about the staircase that bothered him," police Chief Joseph Sinagra told CNN.                                                                                                                      , Det. Erik Thiele pointed his flashlight at the spot where a stair met the riser, Sinagra said. Thiele saw what he believed to be a blanket, and police began to disassemble the staircase.                                                                                                                                                                          , "And as they're removing the steps off the staircase, they see a set of feet," the police chief told CNN. "Little feet."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , They were Paislee's. She was hidden under the staircase with her noncustodial mother, the chief said, huddled in a nest of pillows, blankets and clothes, in what police described as a "dark and wet enclosure."                                                                                                                                                   , Today, the girl is safe, having been returned to her legal guardian and reunited with her older sister. But many questions remain unanswered as investigators try to piece together what she's been through over the last two and a half years.                                                                                                                     , The girl was unable to go to school and it was unclear whether she'd seen a doctor since she disappeared, the chief said. And it's unknown what impact living in these conditions has had on her.                                                                                                                                                                   , The mother, Kimberly Cooper, was arrested, along with Paislee's noncustodial father and grandfather, who both denied having knowledge of Paislee's whereabouts when police executed their search warrant this week.                                                                                                                                                 , Cooper was charged with second-degree custodial interference and endangering the welfare of a child, both misdemeanors, according to police.

Both were arraigned and released on their own recognizance, police said. All three defendants were ordered by the court to stay away from the child.                                      , Lawyers for the men declined to comment, while Carol K. Morgan, an attorney representing Cooper said, "We should all wait until the facts come out.

Sinagra told CNN that Cooper and Shultis Jr. had lost custody of Paislee and her sister and a legal guardian had been granted custody.                                                                  , Sinagra told CNN that police had received several tips about the home, and they had been there about a dozen times over the last two years. But each time, residents denied knowing where the girl was and were instead "adversarial" with police, Sinagra said. Police made it inside several times but were not allowed in the bedrooms areas or in the basement. , "They lied to us for two years -- including the father stating that he had no idea where his daughter was," the chief said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , It wasn't until Monday that police were able to obtain factual information -- not hearsay -- that helped them secure a search warrant, he told CNN. Uniformed officers were stationed outside the home that afternoon around 4 to ensure no one left or entered before police executed their warrant soon after 8 p.m.                                              , In the basement, they found an apartment that included a bedroom with Paislee's name on a wall, Sinagra said. A bed appeared to have been slept in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "Is she here?" officers asked, according to the chief. But residents denied anyone was living in the room, he said. "They said they had set the room up like that in the event that Paislee should ever return."                                                                                                                                                    , Paislee was hidden under the stairs just 3 or 4 feet away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Investigators believe the space beneath the stairs was used more than once, Sinagra said -- maybe each time an officer visited the residence. He pointed to how the staircase was constructed along with how comfortable residents appeared Monday as they insisted they didn't know where Paislee was, an indication to the chief they had done this before.       , Sinagra believes they had been hiding from the time officers arrived outside the home, meaning they could have been in the "wet" and "cold" space for five hours before they were found.                                                                                                                                                                            , Neither the girl nor Cooper made a sound as police took apart the stairs that hid them, Sinagra said. A detective had described the silence as "eerie," the chief said.                                                                                                                                                                                             , While Sinagra is happy that Paislee was found safe, he also said the case was tragic: Whatever the reason Paislee's parents lost custody of her and her sister, he said, that could have "been rectified by now."                                                                                                                                                   , "But this is going to be a major setback for them," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Correction: The caption on a photo in this story has been updated to correct the date it was taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , CNN's Mirna Alsharif, Christina Maxouris and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures were trading around the $4.60/MMBtu level in the third week of February, moving away from a two-week high of $4.80/MMBtu hit earlier this week after a smaller-than-expected storage draw. The latest EIA data showed that the working gas held in storage facilities in the United States decreased by 190Bcf last week, while markets were expecting it to drop by 193Bcf. Still, forecasts for colder weather and higher heating demand combined with a continued slow return of US production limited losses. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the French 10-year OAT eased to 0.7% from the 3-year high of 0.8% touched on February 16th, in line with its global counterparts as investors fled to safer assets after US and NATO said there is âevery indicationâ that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine, pointing to continued movement of troops to the border and false flag operations as justifications for attacks. Elsewhere, Bank of France Governor Francois de Galhau said that soaring inflation and geopolitical risks mean that the ECB could end net asset purchases in the third quarter of 2022, a step that is deemed necessary before rate hikes began. Meanwhile, preliminary data from INSEE suggests that French GDP growth will slow in the first quarter of 2022 due to restrictions brought by the new wave of coronavirus cases. Early estimates showed the French GDP will grow by 0.3% on the quarter during Q1, and is expected to grow by 0.6% during Q2. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lithium carbonate prices in China extended their rally to 414,500 yuan/tonne in mid-February, marking a gain of 50% so far in 2022, amid high global demand and projections of scarcity. Sales of electric vehicles powered by lithium batteries are soaring amid the transition to greener energy. 
According to Adamas Intelligence, a record 25,921 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent batteries were deployed to roads during December 2021, a 68% increase on the year and a 31% increase on the month. At the same time, sales of new energy vehicles in China rose by 157% to 3.2 million units in 2021 and are expected to surpass 5 million in 2022. Meanwhile, battery manufacturers race to secure long-term supply contracts due to mineral scarcity. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence estimates a 26,000-tonne shortfall in 2022 and a 300,000 tonne by 2030, as miners cannot keep up with demand. </td>

Russian backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and government forces have accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules, lifting appetite for safe-haven assets. Meanwhile, police buses were seen entering central Ottawa after authorities promised to end a three-week blockade caused by the âFreedom Convoyâ protesters. Earlier, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had sharpened his tone against the movement, calling it âa threatâ to Canadaâs democracy. On the earnings front, Canadian Tire beat quarterly revenue and profit estimates, driven by sales of sporting goods, garden equipment and home decor during the holiday season. </td>

Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and government forces have accused each other of breaking cease-fire rules, triggering a rush to safe-haven assets. On the corporate front, Airbus posted a record net profit in 2021; Nestle profit increased and the company expects 2022 organic sales growth of around 5%; Commerzbank revenues increased; Orange sees a return to profit in 2022; Schneider Electric profit and revenue beat expectations; and Kering revenue growth surged 35.2% in 2021, boosted by star brand Gucci.

The capesize index, which tracks iron ore and coal cargos of 150,000-tonnes, fell nearly 2% to 1,447, its lowest in more than a week and extending losses for the sixth straight session. "The capesize index has seen average earnings flatten as routes with major volumes, such as west Australia/China and Brazil/Feast, failed to meet trade-volume expectations, while Brazilian miners battle weather-related production issues and shipping delays.", said shipbroker Fearnleys. At the same time, the panamax index which tracks cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of coal and grains, went down 0.4% to 2,365. Conversely, the supramax index increased 6 points to 2,326, as ongoing geopolitical tensions foster demand for coal shipments on the Indonesia-India routes. </td>

Alphabet, Googleâs parent, fell 3.8 percent, and Microsoft was down 2.9 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Tesla, one of the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500, dropped 5.1 percent. The main auto-safety regulator in the United States said it was investigating reports from Teslaâs customers of âphantom brakingâ when they were using their vehiclesâ driver-assistance system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Shares of banks also fell, with Morgan Stanley dropping 5 percent and Wells Fargo losing 3.4 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The prospect that President Vladimir V. Putin will order a Russian invasion of Ukraine has weighed on global markets. On Tuesday, the stock market rose after Russian officials announced a partial troop withdrawal from the Ukrainian border. But President Biden said on Thursday that the possibility of an invasion remained âvery high,â and shelling between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists spiked, raising concerns that the conflict was heating up.                                                                                                                                             , âMarkets are concerned about the Russian troop buildup and a lack of trust in Putinâs declaration that they are beginning to remove troops from the region,â said Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment advisory firm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Investors have also been anticipating that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates as it looks to fight persistently high inflation. Raising the Fedâs policy rate can lead to higher interest rates for houses and cars, causing spending to slow and inflation to moderate. But it also can increase the return on bonds, making riskier investments like stocks less appealing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Minutes released on Wednesday from the Fedâs January meeting showed that most officials agreed that they might need to withdraw their support for the economy even more quickly if inflation does not cool down as they expect. Investors are now anticipating that the Fedâs policy rate could rise to more than 1.75 percent by the end of the year, up from nearly zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which last week crossed 2 percent for the first time since 2019, fell about eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage points, to about 1.96 percent. Yields fall as prices for bonds rise, which happens when investors buy them as they move money out of riskier investments like stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil productionÂ and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burstÂ will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gainsÂ can lead to higher wagesÂ and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessitiesÂ like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Can inflation affect the stock market? RapidÂ inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But the broad nature of Thursdayâs sell-off pointed to more than one trigger. Oil has been trading at prices not seen since 2014, and an invasion by Russia, a big oil producer and Europeâs largest supplier of natural gas, would almost certainly push energy prices higher. But on Thursday, oil fell, with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, down 2 percent, to $91.76 a barrel. Natural gas fell more than 4 percent.                                                                                                                                                                     , âThe concerns for growth going forward and recession risks are new to tradersâ minds,â said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA. âThereâs a lot of fear that the optimistic growth outlook for 2023 is up in the air.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Markets have been volatile for months, with concerns about the Omicron variantâs impact on the economy in November and December bleeding into uncertainty in January and February about persistently high inflation and how the Fed will react to it. Thursdayâs drop was the S&amp;P 500âs worst day in only two weeks, and if the index ends this week in the red it will be its fifth weekly drop just seven weeks into the year. The index is down 8.7 percent since its Jan. 3 high. The Nasdaq composite peaked on Nov. 19, just before the Omicron variant was disclosed, and is down 14.6 percent since then., The consumer staples sector was one of the few that did not fall on Thursday. Walmart was one of the best-performing companies in the S&amp;P 500, climbing 4 percent after it reported that its revenue rose to $152.9 billion, up 0.5 percent in the three months ending in January from a year earlier. The company also said that sales across its U.S. business increased 5.7 percent to about $105 billion in the quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                     , AutoNation fell 3.8 percent, as the companyâs chief executive said it was difficult to forecast whether it could sustain its current high profit levels in 2022. The company reported on Thursday a profit of $387 million in its latest quarter, more than double its profit from a year earlier, while revenue rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In Europe, stock indexes edged lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.7 percent on Thursday. Asian markets closed mixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Goldman CEO David Solomon raises financial targets, takes victory lap after crushing 2020 goals </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon took a moment to bask in his firm's recent performance before raising the company's medium-term financial targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Solomon on Thursday reminded the audience at a Credit Suisse conference that back in 2020, at Goldman's first-ever Investor Day, he faced doubts after revealing a set of goals for a more profitable and efficient firm. But Goldman blew past those targets last year after a historic surge in trading and investment banking activity spurred on by the coronavirus pandemic., "Two years ago now, there was a lot of skepticism around the targets we laid out and what we thought we could accomplish," Solomon said. "When you look at our progress, obviously, we way exceeded the returns."                                                                                                                                                                , Goldman's new guidance for returns on tangible common shareholders' equity is 15% to 17%, up from the 14% target the bank had set in 2020. Still, the firm far exceeded those targets in 2021, when returns topped 24%.                                                                                                                                                          , The bank also increased its 2024 targets for gathering investments and fees in asset management and wealth management as well as transaction and consumer banking revenues. Â                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Shares of the bank dipped 2.4%, tracking the 2% decline of the KBW Bank Index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Solomon, who took over from predecessor Lloyd Blankfein in late 2018, has presided over a revival in the company's focus and share performance. Goldman has gained market share in traditional strengths including trading and investment banking, while building out new digital ventures in corporate cash management and consumer finance.                                    , When Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke admitted that she was "probably a skeptic" that Goldman could reach a 60% efficiency ratio when it disclosed the target in 2020, Solomon corrected her.                                                                                                                                                                             , "You weren't probably a skeptic, you were a skeptic," Solomon interjected, before expressing confidence they could maintain the 60% target. The efficiency ratio is an industry metric that looks at expenses as a percentage of revenue; lower ratios show greater efficiency.                                                                                                  , "We feel great about the strategy," Solomon said. "We're very confident about our ability to move forward and continue to deliver very strong returns to shareholders."                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Got a confidential news tip?

Aside from safe-haven bids, minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting showed policymakers might not be as hawkish as investors feared, as it failed to provide any hints on a 50-basis points rate hike, driving the bullion higher. On top of that, a disappointing US jobless claims report has supercharged existing upward momentum for the bullion. </td>

The networking equipment and software maker also reported better-than-expected revenue and issued an upbeat full-year forecast as it sees particularly strong demand from cloud computing companies.

However, the stock came under pressure on concerns about flat profit margins and its exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Nvidia was down 2.5% in premarket action., Palantir Technologies (PLTR) â The software platform provider's stock slid 8% in premarket trading after quarterly earnings fell short of forecasts. Palantir's adjusted profit of 2 cents per share was half of what analysts predicted, although revenue exceeded forecasts.                                                                                                                , Tripadvisor (TRIP) â Tripadvisor tumbled in the premarket after reporting an unexpected quarterly loss and revenue that fell short of analyst forecasts. The travel review site operator said it expects significant improvement in the travel market this year after what it called "unexpected periods of virus resurgence" in 2021. Shares tumbled 7.9% in premarket trading.              , Fastly (FSLY) â Fastly shares plummeted 31.9% in the premarket after the internet content delivery company gave lower-than-expected 2022 guidance. Fastly reported a narrower-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and revenue that came in above consensus estimates.                                                                                                                           , Hasbro (HAS) â Hasbro rallied 4% in premarket trading after activist investor Alta Fox Capital Management nominated five directors to the toy maker's board.

But it is not a requirement, and some companies separate productions into zones, with different testing and social distancing requirements depending on how closely casts and crews need to work together.                                                                                                                                                                     , Face covering requirements also will vary, the academy said. Nominees and their guests will be seated in the orchestra and parterre areas of the Dolby Theater and will not be required to wear masks. These attendees will be seated with more spacing than usual. The Dolby seats 3,317 people and 2,500 people will be invited, the academy said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Those in the mezzanine may be required to wear masks, as they will sit shoulder-to-shoulder. Infections are declining rapidly in Los Angeles County, and the academy said it was consulting with government officials, infectious disease experts and an independent vendor, Cosmos Health Solutions, on a policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Last week, following a report in The Hollywood Reporter that the academy was planning to forgo a vaccine mandate across the board, the organization was pummeled on social media by fans, stars, politicians and others for what appeared to be an effort to accommodate unvaccinated celebrities. Seth MacFarlane, who hosted the Oscars in 2013, was among those who criticized the academy on Twitter.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Really, Oscars? This would seem, from the outside looking in, a colossal abdication of responsible management. I cannot fathom what piece of information we might be missing that would justify this. https://t.co/9T54TAdIGX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The academy declined to say anything publicly about The Hollywood Reporterâs article, but officials insisted that no decisions had been made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Coronavirus safety protocols have been changing rapidly as infections have declined. On Tuesday, Disney eased its mask mandate for fully vaccinated theme park visitors in California and Florida. This week, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival said attendees (up to 125,000 fans a day in the prepandemic era) would not be required to be vaccinated, tested or masked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , According to government data, 1,713 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized in Los Angeles County as of Thursday, a 54 percent decline since Feb. 1. Over the last week, the county has reported an average of about 4,100 new cases per day, a decline of 77 percent from two weeks ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The academyâs decision puts it at odds with some award shows that are scheduled to take place in the weeks before the Oscars, including the Critics Choice Awards on March 13. Joey Berlin, the force behind the awards, told The Hollywood Reporter that everyone involved would be vaccinated. âI canât invite people to a show where theyâre not going to feel safe,â he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The academy emphasized on Thursday that it would be in direct touch with nominees and studios to walk them through the various safety requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , By Neal E.

The agency said that covers about 416,000 cars. The preliminary inquiry is intended to determine the scope and severity of the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The complaints claim that the vehicle âunexpectedly applies its brakes while driving at highway speeds,â the safety agency wrote in a summary of the investigation. âComplainants report that the rapid deceleration can occur without warning, at random, and often repeatedly.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The investigation is the latest safety concern that Tesla has been confronted with. Separately this year, Tesla recalled 54,000 cars equipped with its Full Self-Driving software to disable a feature that in certain conditions let the vehicles roll slowly through intersections without stopping. Failing to stop at a stop sign can increase the risk of a crash, the safety agency told Tesla in a letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                , The agency also opened a formal investigation last year into Autopilot and how it identifies objects and other vehicles on the road. That inquiry was prompted by 11 incidents in which Teslas operating in Autopilot failed to stop for and crashed into police cars, fire trucks and other emergency vehicles that had flashing lights turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In the last few months, Tesla recalled 12,000 cars to correct a braking problem and recalled 458,000 others for two separate mechanical defects. It also agreed to turn off a feature that allowed drivers or front passengers to play video games on the dashboard touch-screen while car were in motion.

Alphabet, Googleâs parent, fell 3.8 percent, and Microsoft was down 2.9 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Tesla, one of the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500, dropped 5.1 percent. The main auto-safety regulator in the United States said it was investigating reports from Teslaâs customers of âphantom brakingâ when they were using their vehiclesâ driver-assistance system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Shares of banks also fell, with Morgan Stanley dropping 5 percent and Wells Fargo losing 3.4 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The prospect that President Vladimir V. Putin will order a Russian invasion of Ukraine has weighed on global markets. On Tuesday, the stock market rose after Russian officials announced a partial troop withdrawal from the Ukrainian border. But President Biden said on Thursday that the possibility of an invasion remained âvery high,â and shelling between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists spiked, raising concerns that the conflict was heating up.                                                                                                                                             , âMarkets are concerned about the Russian troop buildup and a lack of trust in Putinâs declaration that they are beginning to remove troops from the region,â said Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, an investment advisory firm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Investors have also been anticipating that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates as it looks to fight persistently high inflation. Raising the Fedâs policy rate can lead to higher interest rates for houses and cars, causing spending to slow and inflation to moderate. But it also can increase the return on bonds, making riskier investments like stocks less appealing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Minutes released on Wednesday from the Fedâs January meeting showed that most officials agreed that they might need to withdraw their support for the economy even more quickly if inflation does not cool down as they expect. Investors are now anticipating that the Fedâs policy rate could rise to more than 1.75 percent by the end of the year, up from nearly zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which last week crossed 2 percent for the first time since 2019, fell about eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage points, to about 1.96 percent. Yields fall as prices for bonds rise, which happens when investors buy them as they move money out of riskier investments like stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But the broad nature of Thursdayâs sell-off pointed to more than one trigger. Oil has been trading at prices not seen since 2014, and an invasion by Russia, a big oil producer and Europeâs largest supplier of natural gas, would almost certainly push energy prices higher. But on Thursday, oil fell, with West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, down 2 percent, to $91.76 a barrel. Natural gas fell more than 4 percent.                                                                                                                                                                     , âThe concerns for growth going forward and recession risks are new to tradersâ minds,â said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA. âThereâs a lot of fear that the optimistic growth outlook for 2023 is up in the air.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Markets have been volatile for months, with concerns about the Omicron variantâs impact on the economy in November and December bleeding into uncertainty in January and February about persistently high inflation and how the Fed will react to it. Thursdayâs drop was the S&amp;P 500âs worst day in only two weeks, and if the index ends this week in the red it will be its fifth weekly drop just seven weeks into the year. The index is down 8.7 percent since its Jan. 3 high. The Nasdaq composite peaked on Nov. 19, just before the Omicron variant was disclosed, and is down 14.6 percent since then., The consumer staples sector was one of the few that did not fall on Thursday. Walmart was one of the best-performing companies in the S&amp;P 500, climbing 4 percent after it reported that its revenue rose to $152.9 billion, up 0.5 percent in the three months ending in January from a year earlier. The company also said that sales across its U.S. business increased 5.7 percent to about $105 billion in the quarter.                                                                                                                                                                                     , AutoNation fell 3.8 percent, as the companyâs chief executive said it was difficult to forecast whether it could sustain its current high profit levels in 2022. The company reported on Thursday a profit of $387 million in its latest quarter, more than double its profit from a year earlier, while revenue rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In Europe, stock indexes edged lower.

Garland, the group asked the department to pursue and prioritize prosecutions of people who assault passenger service agents, many of whom have been attacked at airport gates, ticket and reservation areas and other airport locations during the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The request comes at a turbulent time for the airline industry, which began to see a spike early last year in violent and disruptive passengers who have refused to follow Covid protocols and attempted to interfere with flight crew.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , âThe department has not meaningfully pursued federal penalties against individuals who assault or interfere with passenger service agents,â the letter said. It was signed by six labor organizations, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O.âs Transportation Trades Department, the Association of Flight Attendants-C.W.A. and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Greg Regan, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.âs Transportation Trades Department, said he was pleased to see the Justice Department take some steps to address the rise in violent incidents aboard planes, but that more work needed to be done in response to assaults against passenger service agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , âWhen you see this sort of widespread violence and abuse toward transportation professionals, this is where leadership from the federal government is vital,â Mr. Regan said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The Justice Department declined to comment on the letter Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The department said in November it would prioritize the prosecution of federal crimes on commercial aircraft, but many airline and airport workers have still been unsatisfied with the federal governmentâs pace of action. There have been 499 unruly passenger reports since the beginning of the year, but only 80 cases have been referred to the F.B.I. for criminal review as of Feb. 15, according to data from the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2021, there were 5,981 unruly passenger reports.                                                                                                 , Over the past few months, passenger service agents have experienced âserious incidents of physical and verbal assault and harassment,â according to a Feb. 10 letter some of the labor organizations sent to federal officials. The groups pointed to a case at Charlotte Douglas International Airport last year, when an intoxicated passenger physically and verbally assaulted gate agents who had denied him access to a flight.                                                                                                                                                                            , Airline executives and workers have recently implored the federal government to add unruly passengers to a federal no-fly list to bar them from commercial flights. Earlier this month, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines wrote to Mr. Garland arguing that it was a âmuch-needed stepâ toward addressing the surge in violence aboard planes and preventing future incidents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , But some Republican senators have pushed back on those calls. Eight Republican senators, led by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, sent a letter to Mr. Garland on Monday arguing that many of the violent incidents were related to mask mandates on planes and that creating such a list would equate those passengers with terrorists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , âThe creation of this list by D.O.J. would result in a severe restriction on the ability of citizens to fully exercise their constitutional right to engage in interstate transportation,â the senators wrote. âIt also raises serious concerns about future unrelated uses and potential expansions of the list based on political pressures.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Union leaders have condemned the senatorsâ objections and said that disruptive passengers remain a threat to flight attendants and passengers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , âWeâve been punched, kicked, spit on and sexually assaulted,â Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-C.W.A., which represents nearly 50,000 workers at 17 airlines, said in a statement on Tuesday. âThis puts everyone at risk and disrupts the safety of flight, which is never acceptable.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , By Lananh Nguyen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Marcus is finally old enough to have a checking account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , More than five years after Goldman Sachs started its consumer-focused Marcus division, the company said it would begin offering perhaps the most essential of banking services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , âChecking is an important piece that will be added to the puzzle in 2022,â David M.

                                    , The inclusion of Amazonâs stores in Britain, Canada, France, Germany and India prompted an outcry from the company, which claimed that its inclusion was driven by a âpersonal vendettaâ on behalf of the Trump administration, despite consumer complaints about fake products on the platform.

           , The office said some countries had made progress in cracking down on the sale of counterfeit goods, including Brazil, the Philippines, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. It also said it had documented a shift of pirated goods from physical marketplaces to online, in part because the pandemic depressed global tourism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The report also identified a new ecosystem: âpiracy-as-a-service,â in which operators offer website templates, databases of infringed video content or other features that make it easy for customers to set up pirate operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , âThe global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods undermines critical U.S. innovation and creativity and harms American workers,â Katherine Tai, the United States trade representative, said in a statement. âThis illicit trade also increases the vulnerability of workers involved in the manufacturing of counterfeit goods to exploitative labor practices, and the counterfeit goods can pose significant risks to the health and safety of consumers and workers around the world.â                                                                                                                     , The report also examined the impact of counterfeit goods on the people who make them, part of the administrationâs focus on how trade affects workers. Because these businesses operate outside the law, counterfeiting and piracy often go hand in hand with unsafe working conditions, child labor, forced labor and other issues, the trade representativeâs office said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , âCounterfeit manufacturing often occurs in clandestine work places outside the reach of labor market regulations and inspection systems, which increases the vulnerability of workers to exploitative labor practices,â the report said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The report will result in no immediate penalties for the named companies, though it said the goal of publishing such a list was to âmotivate appropriate action by the private sector and governments.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Congress is mulling some actions that could clamp down on Chinese e-commerce sales, including counterfeit goods, to the United States as part of a major legislative effort at promoting U.S. economic competitiveness with China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , One provision, proposed by Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, would raise the threshold for the dollar value of a good that could come into the United States duty free from certain countries, namely China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , That level, called de minimis, is set at $800 in the United States.

The market is even tighter for luxury cars: Nearly three out of four of those cars arriving at dealers in the next three months will be âpresoldâ â meaning a customer has paid a deposit and is waiting to buy the car as soon as it arrives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , âThis tight-inventory situation is going to be around certainly through the first half,â said AutoNationâs chief executive, Mike Manley. âIâm hoping we do see some improvement in the second half.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Selling cars before they arrive from the assembly plant is a substantial change from the traditional industry practice of stocking dealers with hundreds or even thousands of vehicles that can sit for months before they are sold. It also means automakers will have a long road to restocking dealer lots with new vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The shortage stems from the early days of the pandemic, in 2020, when auto plants shut down for nearly two months. The problem was compounded by a shortage of computer chips, which has forced manufacturers over the last 12 months to idle plants temporarily for weeks at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The tight supply has enabled dealers to sell cars at their full list price, or even more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Those higher prices helped AutoNation reap record earnings in the final quarter of 2021, the company said Thursday. The company reported a profit of $387 million, more than double the profit from a year earlier. Revenue rose 14 percent, to $6.6 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The profit jumped despite a 20 percent decline in sale of new cars, to 57,601, a reflection of the higher prices. Sales of used cars, prices of which have also risen substantially, increased 21 percent to 74,442.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Mr. Manley said it was difficult to forecast whether AutoNation could sustain such high profit levels this year. The supply of vehicles and the chances of increasing new-vehicle sales depend heavily on whether the computer chip shortage improves, as automakers are hoping. The Federal Reserve has also indicated that it is likely to raise interest rates, which would increase the cost of financing vehicle purchases.                                                                                                                                                                                 , âThe profitability that weâve been able to develop puts us in a good position,â he said. âBut one thing I donât want to predict is whatâs going to happen in the full industry, because you have a lot of moving pieces.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , By Madeleine Ngo and Chris Cameron                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , WASHINGTON â Steve Dickson, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, will resign at the end of next month, the agency said on Wednesday night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The announcement by Mr. Dickson, who was appointed by President Donald J.

In a letter to staff, Mr. Dickson said it was âtime to go homeâ to his family after 43 years in the aviation industry and more than two years leading the agency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , âOver the past several years, my family has been a source of tremendous encouragement, strength and support,â Mr. Dickson said. âNevertheless, after sometimes long and unavoidable periods of separation from my loved ones during the pandemic, it is time to devote my full time and attention to them.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , He said the F.A.A. was in a âbetter placeâ than it was two years ago, adding that the agency had reinvigorated its safety culture, overcome some of its toughest challenges and âbuilt a stronger, more collaborative, inclusive and open culture.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr. Dickson sometimes came under heavy criticism from lawmakers as he responded to a series of challenges at the agency, but on Wednesday night, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg praised him as âthe F.A.A.âs steady and skilled captain.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , âHis tenure has been marked by steadfast commitment to the F.A.A.âs safety mission and the 45,000 employees who work tirelessly every day to fulfill it,â Mr. Buttigieg said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Dickson, a U.S. Air Force Academy graduate and former pilot who rose to become senior vice president of flight operations at Delta Air Lines, took charge of the F.A.A. as it was reeling after two deadly crashes that grounded Boeingâs 737 Max jet for almost two years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Congress and safety experts condemned the agency for lapses in oversight that helped lead to the crashes, which killed 346 people. Mr. Dickson, who took over the agency months after the Max was grounded, oversaw revisions to the aircraft that allowed the fleet to eventually resume commercial flights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , He then had to navigate a cascade of disruptions to air travel from the Covid-19 pandemic, including new airline safety regulations, travel restrictions, a severe decline in commercial air traffic and a surge in unruly passengers that has led some airline executives to call for a federal no-fly list for those convicted of disrupting flights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The agency had to confront concerns that a nationwide expansion of 5G cellular networks could interfere with sensitive aircraft instruments. The F.A.A. negotiated a compromise with cellular providers in January to partly delay the rollout of 5G service near airport runways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr. Dickson was confirmed in an unusually divided Senate vote in July 2019 after some Democrats raised concerns about his involvement in a whistle-blower case at Delta. The agency had been without permanent leadership for more than a year and a half before his confirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Representative Peter A.

They want other students who attended DeVry during the time it was making its false promises to apply for relief.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Between 2008 and 2015, department officials said, DeVry advertised that 90 percent of its graduates found work in their field of study within six months. In reality, only 58 percent did. School officials knew of the discrepancy and ignored complaints about it from alumni, department officials said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Until Wednesday, the department had taken action only against schools that had closed down, including large chains like Corinthian Colleges and smaller ones like the Marinello Schools of Beauty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , âWe do think that it is really important to show that we are willing to take these actions against open schools, and that there will be liabilities for the current owners of open schools,â James Kvaal, the under secretary of education, said at a news conference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , While noting that the claims occurred when DeVry was under different leadership, a school spokeswoman, Donna Shaults, said DeVry believed that the Education Department had mischaracterized the schoolâs statements about its graduatesâ outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , âWe do not agree with the conclusions they have reached,â she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Officials cast Wednesdayâs action as one of several moves to revitalize an Education Department enforcement arm that was eviscerated during the Trump administration. Betsy DeVos, President Donald J. Trumpâs education secretary, repeatedly stymied investigations into for-profit schools and appointed Julian Schmoke â a former dean at DeVry â to lead the agencyâs enforcement division.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , For four years, Ms. DeVosâs agency approved no new grounds for claims from defrauded students, and rejected 130,000 in what amounted to rubber-stamp denials. Those rejections, and other stalled claims that sat undecided for years, are now the subject of a class-action lawsuit involving some 200,000 borrowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The Education Department said in a court filing last month that it was close to settling that case and hoped to announce a deal by April.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The 1,800 former DeVry students approved for relief through the student fraud claim discharge system, known as âborrower defense to repayment,â will have nearly $72 million in loans forgiven.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , That means they will not have to repay loans made with taxpayer money. The department said it would pursue DeVryâs current owner, Cogswell Capital, for compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Cogswell Capital is an investment firm run by Bradley Palmer, a venture capitalist and financier. Mr. Palmer, who had no experience working in higher education, bought DeVry in 2018 from Adtalem Global Education, which operated several for-profit schools. Adtalem had called itself DeVry but changed its name in 2017 after a series of scandals involving the school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In 2016, DeVry agreed to pay $100 million to settle a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit over its misleading claims about its graduatesâ careers and earnings. A year later, DeVry settled similar claims brought by New York and Massachusetts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A message left at Palm Ventures, which Mr. Palmer has described as a family office that manages his familyâs assets, was not immediately returned. A representative for Adtalem did not immediately return a message seeking comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Education Department said it had also approved borrower defense claims from former students at ITT Technical Instituteâs nursing program, the Minnesota School of Business (also known as Globe University) and Westwood College. Including DeVry, the approvals announced on Wednesday will wipe out $415 million in debt for 16,000 borrowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , By Rebecca Robbins                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The Republican attorney general of Texas on Wednesday sued to strike down the Biden administrationâs mandate requiring travelers to wear masks at airports, on airplanes and on commuter bus and rail systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The suit comes as many governors, including in states governed by Democrats, have been rolling back mask mandates for indoor public settings as infections from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus have plummeted following a record-setting surge last month. But forms of public transportation are regulated by the federal government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Since it was first introduced a year ago, the federal mandate requiring travelers to wear masks has been extended several times, most recently until at least March 18. Brief breaks for eating and drinking are permitted. There are exemptions for travelers younger than 2 and for people with certain disabilities who cannot wear masks safely. Travelers who refuse to comply can be fined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The suit by the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, was filed in federal court in Fort Worth. It argues that the mask mandate is unconstitutional and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lacks the authority to impose the requirement. The Supreme Court recently declined to hear another case that sought to block the mandate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nationâs top infectious disease expert, said in December that he did not believe the country was approaching a point where masks would no longer be necessary on planes. âEven though you have a good filtration system, I still believe that masks are a prudent thing to do, and we should be doing it,â he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The C.D.C. declined to comment on the suit in Texas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Some airline executives have questioned the need for the mask mandate for air travel. The top executive of Southwest Airlines, Gary Kelly, said at a Senate hearing in December that he believed that masks do not add substantial protection in airplane cabins and that the filtration on planes was sufficient. Mr. Kelly, who testified unmasked and recently became the companyâs executive chairman after many years as chief executive, tested positive for the virus later that week.                                                                                                                    , By Matthew Goldstein                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , A key witness in the bribery and money-laundering trial of a former Goldman Sachs executive said the scheme to loot billions of dollars from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund was laid out a decade ago inside the apartment of a flamboyant Asian businessman who remains on the run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Tim Leissner, a former Goldman partner who has pleaded guilty in the scheme, testified in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday that the businessman, Jho Low, had told him and the defendant, his former colleague Roger Ng, about the plan to pay up to $1 billion in bribes to foreign officials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr. Ngâs trial began on Monday and is expected to last several weeks. It will most likely be the only trial that will take place on U.S. soil over the looting of the Malaysian fund known as 1MDB. Mr. Leissner and a Goldman Sachs subsidiary have already pleaded guilty in the case while Mr. Low, a free-spending financier who liked to host lavish parties in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, remains a fugitive.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr. Leissner, who said he had been âclose friendsâ with Mr. Ng as well as his supervisor for Goldman in Asia, was the first prosecution witness to draw Mr. Ng into the center of the brazen scheme to loot the 1MDB fund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Prosecutors around the globe have said the money raised for the fund was supposed to finance infrastructure projects to benefit the Malaysian people, but was instead used to finance lavish spending by Mr. Low and others close to the countryâs former prime minister, Najib Razak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Mr. Leissner said Mr. Low hosted the 2012 meeting at his London apartment. There, Mr. Low described in detail all the government officials who would be paid bribes in order for Goldman to secure the rights to arrange billions of dollars in bond offerings for the 1MDB fund, Mr. Leissner testified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Low also told the former Goldman executives that the bribe money would have to come from the proceeds of the bond offering â and that they would get some of those proceeds as well, according to Mr. Leissner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , âRoger and I were told by Jho that we would be taken care of,â Mr. Leissner said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mr. Leissner said he had known that the scheme was illegal but it did not bother him because securing the bond deals for Goldman would have produced big fees for the Wall Street bank. âI wanted to be a hero at Goldman Sachs,â he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , It was Mr. Ng who originally introduced Mr. Leissner and several others at Goldman to Mr. Low in 2008, Mr. Leissner testified. He added that he and Mr. Ng soon realized that Mr. Low was the key to getting the bond underwriting work for Goldman, even though he had no position at 1MDB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , âHe never had any official role yet he was the key decision maker,â Mr. Leissner said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Mr. Low, who has also been charged with bribery and money laundering, is believed to be residing in China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr. Leissner said he and Mr. Ng both kept their dealings with Mr. Low from most of their Goldman colleagues after the bank had officially rejected their efforts to bring him in as a wealth management client. While several bankers at Goldman did know that Mr. Low was serving as a middleman on the 1MDB negotiations, only he and Mr. Ng knew the details of the looting of the fund, Mr. Leissner said.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , On cross-examination, lawyers for Mr. Ng are expected to question Mr. Leissner on his character and his claims about the degree of Mr. Ngâs involvement in the 1MDB negotiations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Defense lawyers could draw from a dossier that Goldman had put together presenting Mr. Leissner as a master con artist, while the bank was negotiating its own deal with prosecutors and regulators. In his opening statement on Monday, Marc Agnifilo, one of Mr. Ngâs lawyers, sought to call Mr. Leissnerâs character into question, calling him a âdouble bigamistâ and claiming that he was twice married to two women at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                    , Today in the On Tech newsletter, Shira Ovide writes that podcasts have been a freewheeling corner of digital life, but the potential for profits is changing that. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Irelandâs consumer inflation eased to 5 percent year-on-year in January of 2022 from 5.5 percent in the previous month, the first decrease in inflation since February of 2021. Prices rose at a slower pace for transportation (14.1 percent vs 18 percent in December), restaurants and hotels (2.3 percent vs 2.6 percent), and furnishings and household maintenance (2.3 percent vs 2.6 percent), while prices decreased for clothing and textiles (-3.7 percent vs 2.1 percent). On the other hand, inflation picked up for housing and utilities (12 percent vs 11.8 percent), mainly due to higher rents and mortgage rates, and food and non-alcoholic beverages (2.1 percent vs 1.6 percent), driven by breads, cereals, meats, and mineral water. On a monthly basis, consumer prices dropped by 0.4 percent, the first decrease since October of 2020, compared to the 0.5 percent increase in the previous month. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Nigeria's GDP advanced by 3.98% yoy in the fourth quarter of 2021, the fifth consecutive quarter of economic expansion, amid the ongoing recovery from the pandemic crisis which hit hard the country's oil sector. The expansion continued to be driven by the non-oil sector (4.73%), with main positive contributions from agriculture (3.58%), trade (5.34%), information and communication (5.03%) and financial services (24.14%). On the other hand, the oil sector shrank 8.06%, reflecting lower oil output as the average daily crude oil production stood at 1.50 million barrels per day, down from 1.57 mbps in Q3 and 1.56 mbps a year ago. Despite a recovery in oil prices, Nigeria has struggled to meet its production targets due to operational challenges and insecurity coming from pipeline vandalism. On a quarterly basis, the GDP increased 9.63%, following an 11.07% jump in the third quarter. In 2021, Nigeria grew by 3.4%, the fastest expansion since 2014, better than central bank's estimate of 3%. </td>

At the same time, investors weighed on the minutes of the Fedâs January meeting, pointing to a rate hike in March, although the magnitude is still unclear. On the corporate front, Repsol traded 0.5% lower after posting quarterly results, despite reporting a 70% annual increase in free cash flow operations, largely due to higher oil prices during the year. At the same time, the petrol company announced it plans to allocate 35% of investments until 2025 in low carbon activities, including the sale of its stake in the firmâs newly created renewable energy generation unit. </td>

However, the RBI said that such a high figure should not create any panic as it is mostly due to a base effect while maintaining the interest rate at 4% for the 10th time in a row to support economic recovery from the health crisis. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> KitKat and Nescafe-maker Nestle has warned it will increase the prices of its products due to the growing cost of producing its goods.                                                                                        , Mark Schneider, boss of the food group, said it was "safe assumption" that prices would rise this year.                                                                                                                       , He said there was "no place" in the company that was "exempt of inflation".                                                                                                                                                   , Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods company behind Durex and Dettol, also said prices would rise, but added it hoped to absorb most of the increases.                                                                       , Reckitt's costs rose 11% in 2021, but chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said that wouldn't mean prices rising by that amount, as the company had ways to "mitigate and manage pricing"                                        , "We care about the competitiveness of our brands," he told a conference call.                                                                                                                                                 , Jeff Carr, chief financial officer, said the firm's costs had increased "across the board", ranging from crude oil and plastic, to shipping and wages.                                                                        , But he said that company was "absorbing a significant part" of higher operating costs through "efficiency" and "better buying".                                                                                               , "We are not passing it on to consumers," he said. "We are passing some pricing onto consumers but we minimise that through the programmes we haveâ¦to absorb those cost increases."                                            , Shares rose in the company by as much as 5.4% on Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                    , Meanwhile, Nestle said it had already lifted prices by 3.1% in the fourth quarter of its financial to offset rising operating costs.                                                                                          , "It is a safe assumption that our input cost increases for 2022 will be higher than 2021, that is something that we have to reflect in our pricing," said Mr Schneider                                                        , "There is almost no place in the company that is exempt of inflation now," he added.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Turkish Lira Steady Following Unchanged Interest Rate </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Turkish Lira was little changed at 13.6 per USD after the Central Bank of Turkey held its key borrowing costs steady for the second time since September, while reviewing its policy framework to encourage more lira usage. The central bank had slashed its benchmark rate by 500bps in between September and December to support exports and growth, pressured by President Tayyip Erdogan pledges, despite a plunging lira and surging inflation. The latest data showed that consumer inflation hit a 19-year high of 46.68% in January, the highest under President Erdogan's rule and well above the bank's target of 5%, while inflation expectations for the end of the year jumped to 34.1% from 29.8%, according to the TCMBâs February survey of market participants. In the meantime, the Ministry of Finance announced that TRY 200 billion have been deposited in accounts under the governmentâs scheme that protects lira deposits from the currencyâs volatility. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Turkey Holds Interest Rate at 14% </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Central Bank of Turkey left the key one-week repo rate steady at 14% as expected during its February meeting of 2022 citing rising geopolitical risks and arguing again that the recent surge in prices is not supported by economic fundamentals. The bank said it expects the disinflation process to start on the back of taken measures and fading base effects. The Committee reinforced it will continue to use all available instruments decisively within the framework of liraization strategy until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation and the medium-term 5 percent target is achieved in pursuit of the primary objective of price stability. Since September last year, the bank cut the rates by 500bps, pushing the lira down 44% last year and inflation to near 50% in January. Inflation is expected to peak in April or May at around the 50-55% level due to energy price hikes and salary increases. </td>

Meanwhile, tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine could escalate after Russian-backed rebels accused Ukrainian forces of shelling their territory. On Wednesday, NATO accused Russia of increasing troops at the Ukrainian border, while Moscow claimed it had begun withdrawing some of its military units. </td>

ðSo just briefly overlooking the SPY chart, very noticeable large downward channel indicating a drop to the low 400s // 414 to 406 area .. Two things could happen in the morning if Russia does invade, we should immediately gap down to that $430, $429 area.. once it bounces off that demand zone we should see a upward movement of .8% then a catastrophic blow down to that low to that lower trigger. 

ðNow on the other hand if we do get good news and Russia does backtrack and does NOT invade the spy will immediately push up to that 443//444 resistant area test draw down then push back up to that 452 area this is all best case scenario imo. 

ð current window range for the SPY is 3.76% which is showing extreme volatility for the next 7-8 trading sessions.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $QQQ Iâm seeing a similar pattern start to play out now as did in Octâ 2018 the last time Feds raised rates. In a span of 3 months we had a dip followed by three lower lows before getting back on course. Fast forward to the present year rate hike we had a dip Jan 10th to $370 followed by a lower low to $335 Jan 24th. Now here we are headed for our second lower low EOM of $320 or $300 support. I believe our third and final lower low will be around March 16th give or take a day or two, which would take us to either the $300 or $260 support line. I donât see us going below $260 as tutes would start loading the boat as retail is throwing up. Hindsight is 20/20 but thinking back, thereâs no way the markets could continue a 100% increase in equity year over year. This reset was bound to happen. I know the day traders could care less but for the LT traders, stay strong &amp;amp; emotionless. </td>

Iran cooled off. Russia stayed afoot. Isis hid in bunkers.  ... Biden is a laughing stock of the world right now and they all know it.  And Biden is acting like a tough guy trying to step up to Putin.  Can&amp;#39;t wait when Biden says &amp;quot; oh I can one punch Putin in the face and knock him out&amp;quot; ... Biden is trash.

TSLA Choppy day in the markets. Pretty much everything was red today, except for a few runners.  Depends on your time horizon, but I see this as a long-term hold. So just remember to keep that in perspective.

Par warned Shorts (see twit of Feb 15thðð¼)

Par Chadha@par_chadha
43M+ $XELA shares borrowed by shorts; cost to borrow up 15x YTD (source: ORTEX). IMO huge risk to bet against the house with 90k+ shareholders. Reminds me of early days when shorts loved $TSLA for its debt etc.

4)
Exela is in much better situation than in Feb 2021, bc it reduced 454mio of dept! 
In Feb we were around $7.8
- almost daily contract
- 17k employees 
- know how in many area (see web site)

For the above reasons, I think $30 is possible this year (= 4000%). </td>

If you skip forward to about the 25:31 mark within the video, that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m breaking down the TA on said moves. 
 
When people tell you &amp;quot;technical analysis doesn&amp;#39;t work,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s because THEY fail to use it properly.   
 
If a casino can make money on a game of chance, such as craps (dice), then a Trader CAN leverage basic math &amp;amp; statistics (aka, &amp;quot;techncals&amp;quot;) to extract money from the markets.   
 
STOP listening to the naysayers...  They&amp;#39;re naysayers, because they&amp;#39;ve FAILED at what you&amp;#39;re trying to do.   
 
95% of this game is psychology...the other 5% is basic math ð¤·ââï¸

Just got a ride in a @Uber owned by Tesla.
Yes you read that right, my Uber driver told me that the Model 3 he is driving isnât his or owned by @Hertz, but rather a pilot program being run by @Tesla with a small number of highly ranked Uber drivers in California! @elonmusk
