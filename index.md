   <td style="text-align:left;"> Rishi Sunak can afford new Covid support, says think tank </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chancellor Rishi Sunak can afford to step in and help struggling businesses hit by Omicron despite continued high public borrowing, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies.                                                                                                                                                        , IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC that although interest rates were going up, borrowing was still "very cheap".                                                                                                                                                                                                              , He spoke after figures showed the government borrowed less last month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The gap between its spending and tax income stood at £17.4bn in November, £4.9bn down on a year earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , However, the figure was higher than analysts had forecast and it was also the second-highest total for November since monthly records began in 1993.                                                                                                                                                                              , Borrowing hit record levels because of Covid as the government spent billions of pounds on emergency measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , These included the furlough scheme, which wrapped up on 1 October.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mr Johnson said the chancellor would be able to afford to meet demands from pubs, restaurants and nightclubs for financial support.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Although the Omicron variant of Covid has not led to lockdown measures as in previous waves of the pandemic, businesses are struggling because people are reluctant to go out.                                                                                                                                                    , Among those seeking help is nightclub operator Rekom, which has more than 40 venues across the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Peter Marks, chairman of its UK board, told the BBC that attendances were 40% lower than usual "at a time that's absolutely critical for us as a business".                                                                                                                                                                       , He also feared the possibility of not being able to open on New Year's Eve, which is when the chain makes 8% to 10% of its annual profits.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The IFS's Mr Johnson said, however, that it would be "very hard indeed" to provide targeted support to those who needed it most, given that city centres were harder hit than other areas.                                                                                                                                        , He added that fears of fuelling high inflation meant Mr Sunak would be worried about "throwing more billions into the economy at this stage".                                                                                                                                                                                     , Government debt stood at more than £2.3 trillion at the end of November this year - about 96.1% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP) and the highest level recorded since the early 1960s.                                                                                                                                    , The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the government has borrowed a total of £136bn so far in the current financial year (April to November), although this is £115.8bn less than in the same period last year.                                                                                                 , As a result of a lower income from taxes and higher spending, the ONS now estimates that in the 2020-21 financial year the government borrowed £321.9bn. That amounted to 15% of GDP, the highest rate seen since the end of World War Two.                                                                                       , Rising inflation means that it is costing the government more to borrow money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Interest payments on central government debt were £4.5bn in November 2021, £0.4bn more than in November 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , For this and other reasons, says Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics, "the trend in public borrowing is about to deteriorate markedly".                                                                                                                                                                                       , He says that the pick-up in inflation means full-year debt interest payments look set to exceed the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast by £5bn.                                                                                                                                                                      , "All told, we now think that public borrowing will equal about £190bn this year, and would revise up this forecast to around £192bn, if the government reimposed for one month the rules seen during Step Two of the unlocking earlier this year and set up a furlough scheme for businesses that were forced to close," he added., "Public borrowing was broadly on course to meet the OBR's forecast, based on data up to November, but high inflation and Omicron will push it off track."                                                                                                                                                                         , The figures for November seem "like old news now", according to Bethany Beckett of Capital Economics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "These data predate the recent surge in coronavirus infections caused by the Omicron variant, with a near-term tightening of virus restrictions once again a possibility," she said.                                                                                                                                              , "Although the economy has got better at coping with restrictions with each new wave, we still suspect it would prompt a deterioration in the public finances via lower tax revenues and the potential reintroduction of government support schemes."                                                                              , You're Dead to Me explores the food, rituals and traditions!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Tom Holland and Zendaya talk weird photo faces, memes and Spiderman                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , © 2021 BBC.

        +9.12%
       tumbled 28.4% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the company said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration is delaying the review of its still-investigational seizure treatment. The regulator was expected to announce its decision about whether to approve the therapy by Dec. 23; the FDA said in the notice that it is "currently unable to provide an estimate of the timing of an expected action." The FDA is not requiring any additional information from Aquestive at this time. The company's stock gained 16.2% so far this year, while the broader S&amp;P 500

       on Tuesday said they paid an undisclosed price for the entire music interests of ZZ Top. The band agreed to sell its publishing catalogue and income from recorded royalties and performance royalties. BMG had already been co-publisher and administrator of ZZ Top's publishing catalogue. The agreement comes 50 years after Billy Gibbons (guitar, vocals), Dusty Hill (bass, keys, vocals) and Frank Beard (drums) released their debut album, ZZ Top's First Album, in 1971. A 2004 inductee into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, ZZ Top has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. ZZ Top manager Carl Stubner of Shelter Music Group and BMG CEO Hartwig Masuch and KKR partner Jenny Box led the deal.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The annual inflation rate in Hong Kong edged up to 1.8 percent in November of 2021, from 1.7 percent in the previous month, slightly missing market expectations of 1.9 percent. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the inflation rate was 1.2 percent, faster than 1.1 percent in October. It was the highest inflation rate since since July, mainly driven by prices of utilities (31.1 percent); clothing and footwear (6.7 percent); transport (5.3 percent); meals bought away from home (2.5 percent); basic food (1.9 percent); durable goods (1.8 percent); and miscellaneous services (1.1 percent). Looking ahead, inflationary pressures are seen building up due to rising import prices alongside the economic recovery, while core inflation should remain largely contained in the near term, a government spokesman said. </td>

       stock fell 1.5% in Tuesday premarket trading after the food company reported fiscal second-quarter profit that missed expectations. Net income totaled $597.2 million, or 97 cents per share, down from $688.4 million, or $1.11 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of 99 cents missed the FactSet consensus for $1.05. Sales of $5.024 billion were up from $4.719 billion and ahead of the FactSet consensus for $4.839 billion. General Mills said operating profit fell 13% to $800 million due to inflation and supply chain disruption. Still, the company expects elevated COVID-19 at-home dining behaviors and pet food spending to continue. General Mills brands include Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and Blue Buffalo pet food. General Mills now expects full-year organic net sales to rise 4% to 5%, up from previous guidance for a decline of 1% to 3%.

Members of the Board of the RBA noted the economy was rapidly recovering from the delta-induced contraction in Q3 and the omicron variant was not expected to derail the recovery. Meanwhile, Australia’s PM Scott Morrison said the nation must move past the “heavy hand of the government” and authorities should stop enforcing lockdowns, even as nationwide infections soared to new record highs. </td>

       said Tuesday it will leave the retail banking market in France in a move that will affect 460 union employees. The move comes after a strategic review announced in June. ING will continue its wholesale banking business in France, with a focus on sustainable finance. The retail banking business counted 1 million customers. ING said it's currently exploring an agreement for its client portfolio with third parties and it will continue providing banking services to its clients. A social plan for bank employees is subject to approval of the French Ministry of Labor.

ING shares have risen 41.5% in 2021., As strained U.S. hospitals brace for a new surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the fast-spreading omicron variant, doctors are warning of yet another challenge: the two standard drugs they’ve used to fight infections are unlikely to work against the new strain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Steve Gelsi covers banking and cannabis as a Senior Reporter for MarketWatch. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Germany's benchmark Bund yield rose to -0.34% in the third week of December, remaining well above a 13-week low of -0.387% touched earlier in the month as risk appetite returned to markets and equity indexes rose as investors assess how the Omicron coronavirus variant will impact the global economy. Germany renewed restrictions in the country amid a fourth wave, and the Netherlands entered a lockdown while Britain decided not to further tighten rules on social distancing over the coming holidays. On the data front, Germany’s GfK Consumer Confidence gauge for January 2022 fell more than expected to a seven-month low of -6.8. Meanwhile, ECB policymaker Peter Kazimir said inflation in the currency bloc could stay elevated for even longer than the ECB anticipates. Last week, the ECB announced a reduction in the pace of its asset purchases but pledged further stimulus avoiding any discussion about the possibility of future rate hikes. </td>

As daily infections in the US hit their highest in three months, European governments rolled out new social distancing rules and lockdown restrictions, which is causing investors to reassess their Q4 growth projections.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum has been ordered to pay his ex-wife Princess Haya bint al-Hussein more than $728 million (£500 million), in one of the largest divorce settlements ever handed down by a UK court.                                                                               , The figure will be used to cover Princess Haya's security costs for the rest of her life, as well as ongoing costs for the couple's two children -- Al Jalila Bint Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Sheikh Zayed Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum -- with an upfront payment of $333 (£251.5m) due in the next three months., There is no fixed value on the total settlement, as the court ruled that Sheikh Mohammed should pay the annual security costs for his two children, aged nine and 14, for the rest of their lives or until a further court order is issued.                                                                                     , In his written judgement published Tuesday, Mr Justice Moor found that the biggest threat facing Princess Haya and her children Jalila and Zayed, is from "[Sheikh Mohammed] himself, not from outside sources."                                                                                                                , The determination was made in reference to the Sheikh's "campaign" of intimidation inflicted on Princess Haya, including "his ability to make use of the Pegasus software, which is only available to governments," to spy on the Princess and her staff, a revelation which surfaced in court documents in October.            , Other details about Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya's married life were disclosed in the written judgment, including evidence that the princess paid four security staff some £6.7 million ($8.8 million) in blackmail money to stay silent over an affair she had with one of them.                                          , Details of the affair were heard in court earlier in the case, including allegations from the Princess that she had received a threatening phone call from Sheikh Mohammed about it at the time which left her feeling "terrified."                                                                                             , The divorce settlement marks the final stage in a years-long battle between the estranged couple, during which the UK high court determined that Sheikh Mohammed used his "immense wealth, political power and international influence" in an attempt to bully and silence the 47-year-old princess.                            , A separate ruling delivered in March 2020 concluded Sheikh Mohammed had previously organized the abduction of two of his daughters and forcibly returned them to Dubai, where he held them against their will.                                                                                                                  , The Sheikh has repeatedly denied all claims raised in the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago corn futures traded close to $5.9 a bushel, remaining near a 5-month high amid production concerns owing to dry weather in South America and surging global fertilizer prices coupled with solid demand from South Korea, a major buyer in Asia. Also, global supply disruptions due to renewed lockdowns and firm demand for ethanol, a corn-based fuel, continue to support prices. Meanwhile, traders in China expect corn usage to increase as local wheat prices are higher than that of corn, making wheat expensive to replace corn in animal feed. Elsewhere, the USDA in its latest December report kept the forecast for 2021/22 US corn production unchanged at 15.062 million bushels while it raised its estimates higher for foreign corn production as increases for the EU and Ukraine more than offset a reduction for China. The report also forecasted foreign corn ending stocks higher, mostly reflecting increases for Ukraine, the EU, Mexico, and Iran that are partly offset by a reduction for China. </td>

Otis is expecting the deal to boost its adjusted per-share earnings by a mid-single digit percentage starting in 2023.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The global tally for the coronavirus-borne illness climbed above 275.5 million on Tuesday, while the death toll edged above 5.36 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. continues to lead the world with 51.1 million cases  and 87,952 deaths. The U.S. is averaging about 1,300 deaths a day, according to a New York Times tracker, , and cases and hospitalizations are rising again, notably in the Northeast. Omicron has spread so fast that it accounted for 73% of new cases last week, the Associated Press reported, citing federal health officials. Omicron is responsible for an estimated 90% or more of new infections in the New York area, the Southeast, the industrial Midwest and the Pacific Northwest. The national rate suggests that more than 650,000 omicron infections occurred in the U.S. last week. President Joe Biden is expected to outline the latest plan to tackle omicron later Tuesday and it will include the distribution of 500 million home-testing kits to Americans and the deployment of federal medical personnel to overburdened hospitals, the Wall Street Journal reported.
India is second by cases after the U.S. at 34.8 million and has suffered 478,007 deaths. Brazil has second highest death toll at 617,873 and 22.2 million cases. In Europe, Russia has the most fatalities at 293,329 deaths, followed by the U.K. at 147,723., A recent study that surveyed average retirees between age 62 and 75 and found that three-quarters of them had seen their assets remain the same or grow in retirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Ciara Linnane is MarketWatch's investing- and corporate-news editor.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the benchmark Japan 10-year JGB rebounded sharply to a near three-week high of 0.055%, in line with global peers, as a recovery in domestic equities dented demand for safe-haven debt. Meanwhile, the Japanese government upgraded its economic assessment for the first time in seventeen months, as authorities raised their views on private consumption and business conditions amid falling coronavirus infections domestically and easing social distancing rules, despite downside risks from lingering supply issues and raw material price inflation. On December 17th, the Bank of Japan decided to begin tapering corporate debt purchases to pre-pandemic levels and partially unwind its emergency funding scheme from March 2022 onwards. The central bank also mentioned that Japan's economy has picked up, despite remaining in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19. </td>

Additional upside risks stemmed from delays in the approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which some analysts expect to be operational no sooner than September 2022, supply cut threats by the Belarusian President, and fears about harsher sanctions slapped on Russia’s energy sector amid heightened tensions in Ukraine. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bosses from the world's two biggest plane makers have called on the US government to delay the rollout of new 5G phone services.                                                                                                                                                , In a letter, top executives at Boeing and Airbus warned that the technology could have "an enormous negative impact on the aviation industry."                                                                                                                                  , Concerns have previously been raised that C-Band spectrum 5G wireless could interfere with aircraft electronics.                                                                                                                                                                , US telecoms giants AT&amp;T and Verizon are due to deploy 5G services on 5 January.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate," said the bosses of Boeing and Airbus Americas, Dave Calhoun and Jeffrey Knittel, in a joint letter to US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.                                           , The letter cited research by trade group Airlines for America which found that if the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) 5G rules had been in effect in 2019, about 345,000 passenger flights and 5,400 cargo flights would have faced delays, diversions or cancellations., The aviation industry and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft equipment like radio altitude meters.                                                                                    , "Airbus and Boeing have been working with other aviation industry stakeholders in the US to understand potential 5G interference with radio altimeters," Airbus said in a statement.                                                                                            , "An Aviation Safety Proposal to mitigate potential risks has been submitted for consideration to the US Department of Transportation."                                                                                                                                          , This month, the FAA issued airworthiness directives warning 5G interference could result in flight diversions, saying it would provide more information before the 5 January rollout date.                                                                                      , In November, AT&amp;T and Verizon delayed the commercial launch of C-band wireless service by a month until 5 January and adopted precautionary measures to limit interference.                                                                                                     , Aviation industry groups have said the measures did not go far enough, with Boeing and Airbus saying they made a counterproposal that would limit cellular transmissions around airports and other critical areas.                                                              , Last week, United Airlines chief executive Scott Kirby said the FAA's 5G directives would bar the use of radio altitude meters at about 40 of America's biggest airports.                                                                                                       , The US wireless industry group CTIA has said 5G is safe and accused the aviation industry of fear-mongering and distorting facts.                                                                                                                                               , "A delay will cause real harm.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chinese influencer Viya slapped with $210 million fine for tax evasion - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New Delhi/Beijing   (CNN Business)Chinese live-stream shopping influencer Huang Wei, known as Viya, has been hit with a whopping $210 million penalty for tax evasion and kicked off social media.                                                                                                                                                             , Viya — also known in China as the "live-streaming queen" — was ordered to pay 1.34 billion yuan in back taxes, late fees and fines, the State Taxation Administration said Monday on its website.                                                                                                                                                              , It's the largest penalty ever imposed on a live-streamer, according to the Chinese state tabloid Global Times, and a sign that President Xi Jinping's government won't be letting up pressure on internet celebrities anytime soon.                                                                                                                            , From 2019 to 2020, Huang evaded more than 640 million yuan ($100 million) in taxes "by falsely reporting the commission income she earned from live-streaming platforms," a tax official in Hangzhou said on Monday.                                                                                                                                           , "If she can pay the tax, late fee and fine within the prescribed time limit, she will not be investigated for criminal accountability," the official added.

Similarly, a statement on Weibo said her account was "not available."                                                                                                                                     , But in a Weibo post reviewed by CNN before her account was taken down, Huang said she was "deeply guilty."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Wrong is wrong, I am willing to bear all consequences for my mistake," she added in the post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Her husband Dong Haifeng also apologized on his Weibo account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "I did not help Viya to do a good job," he wrote. "I felt very guilty. As well as apologizing to the public, I should also apologize to my wife, Viya."                                                                                                                                                                                                        , It is not clear when Huang will be back online. In November, tax authorities slapped smaller fines on two other top shopping influencers and their accounts have still not been restored.                                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Huang, 36, became one of China's most popular influencers over the last decade, helping to sell goods worth billions of yuan. She has also participated in public welfare activities organized by Alibaba-owned Taobao, by helping sell agricultural products from poorer areas, and has won government awards for her efforts.                                , Chinese authorities have intensified scrutiny of this powerful industry over the last few months. In August, the Ministry of Commerce outlined proposals for an "industry standard" for live-streamers who market products on online shopping platforms. The rules included details about how hosts on such shows should dress or speak in front of the camera., China tech stocks fell in Hong Kong, as the news of the fine on Viya jolted the live-streaming industry in the region. Both Alibaba (BABA) and Kuaishou Technology were down nearly 1.5%, while video-sharing website Bilibili (BILI) plunged over 6%.                                                                                                         , This crackdown on rich social media stars comes at a time when President Xi is determined to redistribute wealth in the world's second-largest economy as part of his campaign for "common prosperity."                                                                                                                                                        , </td>

says the cash will be used to fight Covid-19 in the country.

ruling, meaning only opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who the UK considers as the legitimate leader, can decide what happens to the gold.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Mr Guaidó and Mr Maduro have separately appointed two different sets of governors to Venezuela's central bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr Guaidó, who is recognised by more than 50 countries as the legitimate president, wants the gold to stay in the BoE's vaults.

presidential palace and in control of the government, military and police, has sued BoE to have the funds released.

controversial polls, which most opposition parties boycotted.

critics have blamed him for mismanaging Venezuela's economy, causing a severe crisis where millions of people need aid due to collapsing public services, soaring unemployment and a devalued local currency.                                                                                                                                                 , They claim Mr Maduro will use the funds to pay off foreign allies that support his regime.

Union, Canada, Switzerland, Panama and Mexico since 2014 over corruption, human rights violations and the suppression of democracy.

recognition of Mr Guaidó as Venezuela's acting president was "clear and unequivocal".                                                                                                                                             , On Monday, the Supreme Court said that the Court of Appeal ruling was "misplaced", because all British courts needed to accept that Mr Maduro was not recognised as president "for any purpose".                                                                                                                                                                  , However, it has now asked the Commercial Court to consider another issue - whether Mr Guaidó has been recognised by the UK government as merely being Venezuela's head of state, or if he has been recognised as its head of government as well.                                                                                                                  , Citing the Transition Statute - articles in the constitution which in such cases call for the leader of the National Assembly to step in - Juan Guaidó declared himself interim president in January 2019.                                                                                                                                                        , He has since used these laws to appoint central bank officials, which Mr Maduro continues to contend is not permitted under Venezuelan law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr Guaidó welcomed the ruling on Monday, saying he and his appointees would "continue to be dedicated to the constitutional duty to protect the assets of the Republic for future generations".

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Copper futures bounced back above $4.3 per pound, supported by a weaker dollar, low inventories and expectations that policy easing in China would boost demand for industrial metals. Inventories of copper in LME-registered warehouses declined 66% to 80,000 tonnes from the August high of 238,725 tonnes. Additionally, production at MMG Las Bambas copper mine, Peru's fourth-largest copper mine and the world’s ninth, remains suspended. Meanwhile, Chile’s President-elect Gabriel Boric pledged to oppose a controversial $2.5 billion iron-copper mine that was approved in August after years of legal wrangling. The International Copper Study Group reported the copper market was in a 161,000 tonne deficit in the January-September period, compared with a 239,000 tonne deficit in the same period a year earlier. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hovered around 1.43%, above a two-and-a-half-month low of 1.36% hit on December 3rd as rising rates of Covid and the new Omicron variant pose a new risk to the US economy. The Omicron variant of coronavirus is now the dominant variant in the US and makes up 73.2% of recent cases. The rate of daily infections is now double from late October, when it was at a 3-month low. In addition, Goldman Sachs lowered US 2022 economic growth as US Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support President Biden's $1.9 trillion Build Back Better Act. The Federal Reserve’s more hawkish turn on monetary policy also remained in focus. The US Fed said at its December meeting it would speed up its tapering of bond purchases, putting it on track to conclude it in March 2022 and paving the way for three interest rate hikes by the end of next year. </td>

However, market participants shifted their focus to whether the currency could sustain its strength next year, with traders dialing back long positions in the past two weeks amid concerns that authorities may rein in the currency’s recent gains. The People’s Bank of China’s official midpoint has been persistently softer than market expectations since mid-November. The central bank has also been increasing its foreign currency buying from banks, and hiked the foreign exchange reserve requirement ratio by 200 basis points to 9% effective Dec.15.

Meanwhile, investors weighed dovish statements from Mr. Kuroda against the central bank's decision to taper its corporate debt purchases to pre-pandemic levels and scale back some of its emergency funding scheme upon reaching the March 2022 deadline. The BOJ also maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1% and that for 10-year bond yields around 0%, as widely expected.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Nikkei 225 Index jumped 2.08% to close at 28,518 while the broader Topix Index gained 1.47% to 1,970 on Tuesday, as risk sentiment improved markedly in Asia, while investors continued to monitor the situation around the omicron variant. Today’s action came after a two-day rout in Japanese equities, driven mainly by the fast-spreading omicron variant and the Bank of Japan’s taper announcement last week. Meanwhile, BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that it was too early to consider normalizing monetary policy, bolstering the view that the Japanese central bank would lag behind other central banks in scaling back monetary stimulus. All sectors of the market participated in the rebound, with notable gains from Lasertec (4.86%), Nintendo (3.72%), Tokyo Electron (4.4%), SoftBank (1.1%), Shionogi (5.3%), Nippon Yusen (2.4%), Kawasaki Kisen (3.68%) and Fast Retailing (2.69%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.86% to close at 7,355 on Tuesday, helped by gains in healthcare and mining stocks, while investors continued to monitor the situation around the omicron variant. Prime minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday that Australia must move past “the heavy hand of government” and authorities must stop shutting down people’s lives with lockdowns, as the country is pushing to ease curbs amid high vaccination rates. Sentiment was also lifted after the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s December meeting minutes, which showed that the central bank is adamant not to lift rates until it sees stronger wage growth. Gains in healthcare stocks were led by CSL Limited (4.91%) which continued to recover after heavy losses last week, along with Sonic Healthcare (2.36%), Ramsay Health (3.11%) and Cochlear (3.85%). Heavyweight miners also advanced following a strong rally in iron ore prices, with gains from BHP Group (1.48%), Rio Tinto (3.23%) and Fortescue Metals (1.7%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Solhan, Burkina Faso: How children were used in a 48-hour deadly rampage for gold - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The men were shot as they slept outside, having spent their days underground, choking in the Sahel dust, digging and panning for gold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , They were killed by children -- some apparently as young as 12 -- and men who had arrived on dozens of motorbikes and were egged on in their murderous spree by women who knew the village well, according to witnesses. The local militia had left. The army came to the rescue for a matter of hours in the morning but then left before dusk, letting the attackers return the following night to burn the village down and most likely steal what gold it had.                , In the end, somewhere between 170 and 200 people died, according to estimates by a local police source and other officials, and it still remains unclear who the killers were.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The massacre in Solhan, northern Burkina Faso, took place over two nights of extraordinary brutality in June 2021. The killings soon faded from international headlines, absorbed into the rhythms of persistent violence in the Sahel region, an arid stretch of land sandwiched by the Sahara Desert and the African savannah, and wracked by the climate emergency.                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In the lawless and remote communities of the Sahel, jihadists increasingly hold sway. Yet one likely culprit in this incident, al Qaeda's local affiliate JNIM, condemned the attack's brutality. And the other main suspect, ISIS, chose to blame it on al Qaeda, according to an ISIS-affiliated newspaper.                                                                                                                                                                     , Dozens of interviews by CNN with survivors, local witnesses and Burkina Faso officials paint the most complete and disturbing narrative yet of a rampage perpetrated over 48 hours, partially by children, that the US-backed and trained Burkina Faso military was powerless to stop.                                                                                                                                                                                            , Yet few officials or witnesses agree on a coherent and consistent motive for the attack. Were the child attackers sent for Solhan's gold, as currency for their Islamist masters? Was it a punishment killing ordered by jihadists against villagers loyal to the government?                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The story of Solhan is a notable mark in the patina of brutality spreading across the Sahel. The intervention -- and now ongoing drawdown -- of the French military, the arrival of European Union forces, and the Pentagon's sustained support mean billions have been spent in attempts to bolster the local security forces. Yet violence has spiraled instead, particularly in Burkina Faso over recent years.                                                                , The crisis in some of sub-Saharan Africa's poorest states presents an imminent threat to Europe's security, and by extension the United States, analysts say, in providing a secure and spacious breeding ground for terror networks. US officials have described the "wildfire of terrorism" in the Sahel, with al Qaeda and ISIS "on the march" in West Africa, aiming to "carve out a new caliphate."                                                                          , Illicit gold has emerged as a key source of funding for jihadist groups, who have been seizing so-called "informal mines" -- small-scale mining sites which rely largely on physical labor and basic technology to extract precious metals and minerals -- in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger since 2016, according to a Crisis Group report from 2019.                                                                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Bachir Ismael Ouédraogo, Burkina Faso's minister of energy and mines, told CNN the country lost 20 tons of gold through informal mining and exports every year, worth roughly $1 billion on the open market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Ouédraogo describes it as a "war economy," a system that uses well-coordinated routes across the African continent. "The gold you end up buying is financing terrorism, and affecting our families here," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The first night: Massacre                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Trapped in the arid plains around 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the capital Ouagadougou, Solhan's gold is the village's only asset, and its curse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Satellite images of the village show the damage that informal mining has done to the terracotta soil -- the charred grey tailings and spoil from the intense activity of men who spend so many hours digging underground that they must sleep outdoors to recover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A local government-backed militia called the VDP (a French acronym meaning Volunteers for the Defense of the Country) provides some security. Yet on the night of June 4, Solhan was left mostly defenseless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , More than 100 jihadists, on dozens of tricycles and motorbikes, had been spotted 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Solhan that afternoon, according to Boureima Ly, the emir of the local region of Yagha.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The army was warned of a possible attack, but it was unclear if it would target Solhan or nearby Sebba -- according to Aly Bokoum, an activist with the Sahel Regional Youth Council in Burkina Faso -- so the local unit chose to stay in Sebba, where it is based. The VDP in Solhan also contacted the army about the threat but were told to leave the village, according to Bokoum.                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , CNN has made multiple attempts to contact Burkina Faso's army for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Gold appeared to set the attackers' priorities. Mines at Mousiga, a tiny settlement to Solhan's east, were hit first, according to a mining official and a miner who were present. Many of the survivors, witnesses and officials requested anonymity for their safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Their faces were hidden with scarves," the miner said of the assailants. "There were many of them on bikes and they started shooting. I started running for my life -- for 30 kilometers, all night, to safety." This miner said he did not see children among this group and two other officials denied the involvement of children at the Mousiga mines.                                                                                                                       , The distant gunfire from Mousiga was misinterpreted by the Solhan miners, who "thought it was the army coming" on a routine patrol and so "stayed next to their wells," said the mining official. The attackers then hit a VDP base on the road into the village, before moving on to their main target.                                                                                                                                                                          , On entering Solhan, the convoy of children, women and likely some men split. One group turned left towards the mines. Another drove calmly into the center of the village.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The first shots in Solhan, heard by witnesses at 2:08 a.m., were at the mines, the police source said. "The gold-diggers were first ... ambushed ... killed at random," he said, while describing the typical night-time scene. "Most of the [miners] sleep outside, on site. They can't sleep indoors, and they don't go home either. Usually only a few of them get into the well late at night, and most come out because of the heat."                                        , One miner said some victims were shot dead as they slept outside and others were slaughtered as they worked, trapped underground. "All [the attackers] found outside were people sleeping," he said. "That's what made it possible for them to massacre them like that."                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Another miner said: "People started coming out of the pits and running ... running for our lives." He added that others hid inside the 30-foot-deep wells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The mining official described how a large gun was positioned beneath a nearby tree for use in the attack. "Many ran away, but when you run, you're going to be seen and they shoot," he said, adding that some miners survived by hiding in the pits until 8 a.m. "The first person who went down to the site [the following day] called me, and said the bodies were lying like fish," the official said.                                                                        , Several witnesses and officials told CNN that the attackers had in-depth knowledge of Solhan's layout. "These are people who take the time to study their target," confirmed the police source, who said witnesses mentioned distinctly hearing women's voices among the attackers. "They indicated to 'go to into this guy's house, do this and that,' and told children to 'go here and there,' that they couldn't let one person leave," the source said.                      , Local activist Abdou Hoeffi, from the human rights group Burkina Faso Movement for Human and People's Rights (MBDHP), said the women played a cheerleading role with the child assailants, with shouts of: "You are a good shooter! You go!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , One witness, who said his parents were killed in the attack, told CNN in Solhan: "They came with women and little children holding guns. Francois, a shopkeeper, he was taken away, my friend. If it was a man, they killed him -- a boy, they kidnapped him. A little one like that," he said, gesturing the embrace of an infant in his arms, "who was breastfeeding [was taken away]. His mother lost her mind."                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , One Solhan woman, her bright blue dress glistening as she sifted grains through a sieve, described surviving the night: "They destroyed everything ... I fled into my house with my child on my back ... I couldn't sleep all night. We saw the light from the bullets all over the place ... It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all."                                                                                                     , Another witness said he and his wife were in bed with their 5-day-old baby when they heard the gunfire. "Three terrorists passed by my house, in front of me, talking. They did not stop. I could see the bullets raining down everywhere in the night." The witness, a former security guard for the local cellphone antenna, said the attackers disabled the phone mast that night and removed its battery, cutting the village off from the outside world and a chance of help., The attackers left at dawn, and the same witness said that the villagers started to venture outside again by 5 a.m. "I couldn't count the number of corpses that were on the side of the road," he recalled. "Everywhere you go, there are bodies lying around."                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The mine was also an apocalyptic scene. "We found that everyone died at the well. I made up to eight trips with a motorcycle cab to carry corpses," said another survivor."  The mining official added that "everyone was loaded on and off the motorbikes like bags of grain."                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Then the army finally arrived. One miner told CNN the attackers depended on the military's slow reaction when launching their assault. "This is Burkina Faso. There is no fast response," the miner said. "If they knew that in 30 or 40 minutes the army would come, they wouldn't [attack]. But they took all their time."                                                                                                                                                      , When the military did arrive, there was little to do but bury the dead, he said. "They dug a big hole. There was no other solution."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The ex-phone antenna guard said the security forces asked villagers "to go back home and lock the door, and to not hide any terrorists."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Two officials said the militants' convoy did not really leave at first light but instead relocated to a hideout in the brush, and waited. The mining official specified a remote border area where he believed they had hidden. The police source said it was not clear if they met leaders there for further instructions, or just waited for the cover of night.                                                                                                                , Some of the villagers who remained in Solhan tried to flee, said the police source. "They didn't know if it was over or not," he said. The hospital in the nearest city, Dori, was "overwhelmed," he said. But it was unclear if the attackers were finished with Solhan. At dusk, the answer came.                                                                                                                                                                               , The second night: Destruction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "I heard the sound of their motorcycles and said, 'Ah, they are [here] again,'" one witness said. "I went back to my yard, turned off the lights in my house, took my mat, took my blanket." He said he left for another village -- traveling on foot with a group of Solhan's children, elderly residents and pregnant women.                                                                                                                                                    , But the convoy's focus was different this time: They wanted to eradicate or loot all that remained. "They started to burn. They entered the houses," said one survivor. "At the stores, they took clothes, drinks, money, put them in their vehicles."                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "They came back, they found four motorcycles at our place," another survivor said. "They burned everything. They burned all our houses, until even the sheet metal was gone. They took rice, sugar, oil and boxes of other things."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Showing a cameraman around what remained of his home, the survivor gestured to the devastation -- the walls black with soot, apart from a patch where the TV was fixed before it too was looted. "The grenade went through the wall and went to the other side," he said, pointing at a missing patch of plaster. "The whole roof is gone."                                                                                                                                       , The mining official said 80 sheep were also slaughtered in the violence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Young men who survived the onslaught sought medication for the psychological trauma in nearby Dori, he added. "They were given pills or injections, because they say they couldn't close their eyes, because they could still see the dead bodies."                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Video filmed in July shows the charred village clinic -- the hospital beds and consultation room beyond use. Shops and homes were incinerated, and rows of buildings left collapsed or with only their metal gates remaining. Motorcycles were torched. Even the mining machinery used to break rocks was half-smashed, yet in the video some of it still hummed around the mines that remained functioning.                                                                      , Shell casings still lay on the ground. The scale of destruction -- fueled, it seemed, by something more nihilistic than just looting -- surprised some officials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Since June, officials, experts and survivors have been seeking to understand more about the massacre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The government, facing protests in Dori over its inaction and security failings, blamed jihadists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Government spokesperson Ousseni Tamboura told Radio France Internationale that two suspects had been detained before the attack and the arrests had led officials to link it to a little-known group called Mujahed al Qaeda, which is connected to the al Qaeda affiliate JNIM. Tamboura said gold was also a motivating factor. In the immediate aftermath, the government fired some security personnel and declared three days of national mourning.                          , Tamboura told CNN in November the government believes al Qaeda affiliate JNIM was behind the massacre. He put the death toll at 132, which includes attackers killed in the incident, and fatalities from a neighboring attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Tamboura declined to comment on the army's absence in Solhan that night, and said that the Burkina Faso military followed all protocols set between them and the US as a condition for aid. The spokesman added that the jihadi groups were fueled by hunger to control resources, not by ideology.                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A French military intelligence official, who didn't want to be named discussing sensitive information, agreed that jihadists were likely responsible, saying the massacre was likely committed by a group "in the process of being formed," linked to JNIM. The official said attacks against the general population, as indiscriminate as those on Solhan, were more the hallmark of ISIS, however.                                                                              , Display of violence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The display of violence has once again highlighted the rapid deterioration of social structures and security in the Sahel region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A US intelligence official said: "There is absolutely a continued need for Western involvement and engagement to address the expansion of the al Qaeda- and ISIS-based groups in the area and not give them complete freedom of movement -- as well as to build [the] capability [and] capacity of African partners."                                                                                                                                                             , The US official added that the crisis seemed to be fueled by local partnerships between jihadists and not an influx of ISIS fighters from the collapse of the former ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They said that they have not noticed a broad trend of ISIS fighters moving from the Middle East to the Sahel area, with the exception of one or two persons of interest.                                                                                                   , The official said the main concern was how ISIS affiliates across Africa were able to share tactics and build each other's capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Whether it's physical facilitation capabilities from a group like ISIS Somalia with more skilled fighters [or] better media coordination from other groups, and being able to rapidly disseminate those capabilities more widely ... it is hugely concerning," they explained. "You could take a group that is probably not very effective and make them very effective quickly, if they're able to leverage some of that skill set."                                            , In Burkina Faso and its Sahel neighbors Mali and Niger, armed Islamist groups have killed more than 800 civilians in attacks during 2021 alone, according to Human Rights Watch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Three days of mourning was declared in Burkina Faso after an August attack in the village of Gorgadji, about 50 kilometers west of Dori, where militants killed 80 people, reported Agence France-Presse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Fourteen soldiers were reportedly ambushed and killed in October near Yirgou, also in the north, the site of a similar attack that killed 15 police in June, according to Reuters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Gunmen killed dozens of people in another massacre in Yirgou in 2019, according to Amnesty International.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , This rise in violence has occurred despite the US's enduring, low-profile military mission in Burkina Faso, which pumped in tens of millions of dollars in aid during 2018-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Dozens of advisers are reported to mentor elements of the country's military, while a US embassy factsheet said the US has trained and equipped 3,000 soldiers and gendarmes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Yet significant swathes of Burkina Faso's volatile north remain outside of the government's control. Long-running accusations of abuses by the military have also complicated its relationship with its key military backers, specifically France and the US.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Human rights organizations also face difficulties in Burkina Faso.

"These are people who take the time to study their target," he said. "It is painful to see a woman instructing a child to kill such and such. Painful."                                                                                                                                                                                                     , And for the survivors, the initial absence of the army, as well as its departure as night fell, are indications of the dark place they live in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "If the [army] are not with the people, how is that possible?," one survivor said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold traded below $1,800 an ounce on Tuesday, remaining relatively subdued as investors assessed the impact of soaring omicron cases and prospects of higher interest rates. Safe-haven inflows into gold eased as global equities bounced in Asian trade on Tuesday from omicron-driven lows. Analysts also noted that reduced risk appetite and low-volume trading going to the year-end will do little to help the yellow metal. Elsewhere, despite gold’s appeal as a hedge against inflation and uncertainties, interest rate hikes would increase the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding bullion. However, analysts warned that omicron-related risks could lead to a more dovish central bank narrative in 2022, which may support gold prices. </td>

In late 2020, then-President Donald Trump signed a law that bans the trading of securities in foreign companies whose audit working papers can’t be inspected by U.S. regulators for three years in a row. That has led to a countdown that will force many Chinese companies to leave U.S. exchanges., The Biden administration has also added dozens of Chinese companies and research institutes to blacklists restricting access to U.S. investment and technology for their alleged support for China’s military and the mass surveillance of mainly Muslim ethnic groups. SenseTime Group Inc., a Chinese developer of facial-recognition technology, briefly delayed its plans for an IPO of shares in Hong Kong after being placed on a U.S. investment blacklist, before relaunching the deal this week. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Shanghai Composite gained 0.2% to around 3,600 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.1% to 14,555 on Tuesday, as mainland stocks struggled for direction a day after China cut its lending benchmark loan prime rate. China slashed its one-year LPR for the first time in 20 months in a bid to prop up the slowing economy, lowering it by 5 basis points to 3.8%, as widely expected. On the virus front, the country rolled out even more stringent Covid quarantine and border control measures to counter the threat of omicron, after six cases of the new variant were identified in three cities within a week. Elsewhere, analysts expect Beijing’s regulatory crackdowns to continue in 2022, with particular focus on data protection and deals that present national security risks, but qualified that clearer rules will give investors some certainty about the regulatory environment. Consumer staples, healthcare and technology stocks led the market gains, while the new energy sector lagged behind. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Nikkei 225 Index jumped 1.7% towards 28,230 and the broader Topix Index gained 1.3% to 1,965 on Tuesday, as the global sell off in risk assets abated in Asia, while investors continued to monitor the situation around the omicron variant. Today’s action came after a two-day rout in Japanese equities, driven mainly by the fast-spreading omicron variant and the Bank of Japan’s taper announcement last week. Meanwhile, BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that it was too early to consider normalizing monetary policy, bolstering the view that the Japanese central bank would lag behind other central banks in scaling back monetary stimulus. All sectors of the market participated in the rebound, with notable gains from Lasertec (3.4%), Nintendo (3.7%), Tokyo Electron (3.4%), Toyota (1.5%), Shionogi (7%), Nippon Yusen (1.5%), Science Arts (10%) and Fast Retailing (1.7%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2% to around 7,310 on Tuesday, helped mainly by gains in financial stocks, while investors stayed cautious amid surging omicron cases which triggered virus curbs in Europe. Domestically, Australian authorities urged a “move away from fear” and to “learn to live alongside” the virus on Monday, resisting calls for tighter restrictions as the country is pushing to ease curbs amid high vaccination rates. Sentiment was also lifted after the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s December meeting minutes, which showed that it is adamant not to lift rates until it sees stronger wage growth. The “Big Four” banks and other financial firms traded higher, led by a 5% rebound in Magellan shares which slumped in the previous session after losing a major client. Energy stocks also rebounded, tracking wild swings in oil prices. Elsewhere, mining companies and technology firms were mixed in early trade. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Australian economy was rapidly recovering after the interruption to growth caused by the outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID-19, the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) December meeting minutes showed. "High rates of vaccination and substantial policy support continued to underpin the recovery," it noted,  adding that the emergence of the Omicron variant was a new source of uncertainty but it was not expected to derail the recovery. The board reiterated that it remained committed to holding interest rates steady at a record low of 0.1% while considering how and when to taper its A$4 billion bond-buying. The decision would depend on how the economy fared, with data on jobs, inflation, and spending particularly important. "The first option was to reduce the pace of purchases from mid-February with an expectation of a likely end point in May. The second option was to reduce the pace of purchases and review it again in May. The third option was to cease purchases altogether." </td>

Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 futures each rose 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.6%. Tuesday’s action came after three straight down days for the major averages, driven mainly by fears about the new variant and a hawkish policy turn from the Federal Reserve. Also weighing on sentiment is democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to the Biden administration’s $2 trillion Build Back Better Act, which is set to be voted on by the US Senate in January. All sectors of the market finished lower, led by losses in consumer cyclical, financial, industrials and basic materials stocks.

Her longer-term 2022 forecast, which came out Monday, is built on the assumption omicron won't lead to hospitalization spikes, economic shutdowns and more supply chain trouble.                                                    , Even though her top wildcard is Covid, her base case is that 2022 will be a strong year for the market. Plus, she believes one of this year's biggest losers will stage a major rebound.                                                                                                                                                 , "EM [emerging markets] is very well positioned, but it's been absolutely punished from the regulatory overhangs.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Democratic retirement floodgates just burst open - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy announced Monday that she will not seek a fourth term in Congress, the latest in a rapid series of retirements within the Democratic ranks that suggest momentum is moving heavily against the party as it seeks to hold on to its razor-thin majority next November., Murphy's decision came less than 24 hours after New Jersey Rep. Albio Sires said he would be retiring at the end of this Congress. And, just before the Sires' news, California Rep. Alan Lowenthal said he, too, would be stepping aside.                                                               , All together, there are now 22 Democrats retiring or running for other offices this election cycle as opposed to just 11 Republicans doing the same.                                                                                                                                                     , Two years ago, just nine Democrats had announced their retirement plans at this point of the election while 24 Republicans had done the same, according to CNN's political unit.                                                                                                                         , While there will always be some amount of attrition in a chamber as large as the House, the "who" is leaving should worry Democrats.                                                                                                                                                                     , Take Murphy. She is widely regarded as a rising star within the party and was expected to run for Senate in 2022 until fellow Rep. Val Demings (D) got into the race against Sen. Marco Rubio (R).                                                                                                       , Her 7th District has been targeted by state House Republicans in the Florida redistricting process but it was not yet clear what the final seat would look like. Without Murphy in the race, Republican map-makers will likely work to make the seat considerably more friendly to their side.           , Losing a member like Murphy -- a prodigious fundraiser and a talented campaigner -- is always a blow but more so in an election like this one where Democrats are clinging to their majority.                                                                                                            , Ditto retirements of powerful chairs like John Yarmuth (Budget Committee) and Eddie Bernice Johnson (Science, Space and Technology Committee).                                                                                                                                                           , When these sorts of members walk away -- either from powerful posts or promising careers -- it send a very clear signal to every single member of the Democratic caucus: Things are bad, I don't see them getting better and now's the time to head for the hills.                                       , And that message, of course, has a snowball effect as other members wondering about whether to run again see that their colleagues have concluded now is the time to go and jump ship themselves.                                                                                                        , The Point: House Democratic leaders have worked desperately to avoid a rush to the exits from within their ranks. It appears they have failed.                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both declined more than 1% Monday. The S&amp;P's three-day drop of 3% was its worst such showing since September. The Dow lost nearly 1,000 points over the previous three sessions.                                                                                                                            , Reopening plays saw some relief buying on Tuesday.

Officials with the World Health Organization said omicron is more contagious than any previous variant of Covid-19.

The Senate will vote on Biden's sweeping social safety net and climate policy bill in January, despite Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's opposition to it. It is unclear if Democrats will try to pass a smaller bill that includes only parts of the full package.                                                                                                     , Got a confidential news tip?

The true cost is $5 trillion. Not $1.75 Trillion. It is not paid for. The spending will promote more inflation. The electric grid and all our energy infrastructure will be severely damaged, sinking the economy and jacking up costs. In his statement, he added concerns about national security. Whether the U.S. would have sufficient resources to deal with Russia and China if need be. He is always insisted on work requirements for social spending. He has always opposed a middle-class entitlement state., And more generally, Sen. Manchin has consistently rejected the Biden transformation policy regarding canceling traditional cultural values, ending traditional American history, using over-regulation to control the economy, rejecting free enterprise capitalism or taxing our businesses and middle-income blue-collar families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , MANCHIN KILLING BBB LIKEY SAVED US FROM ECONOMIC ‘DISASTER,’ EXPERTS SAY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , FreedomWorks economist Stephen Moore argues Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's rejection of Biden's 'Build Back Better' plan is 'an early Christmas present for America' given the bill would have led to massive increases in debt and higher taxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , I continue to believe the Biden policy agenda is dead. It was all wound up in this monstrosity bill, and that's over. There may be some new bill next year, but it's going to have to be a lot different to get any traction. This bill is killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Now the question is: Can Biden preserve his presidency? Which looks to be failing. On inflation, on Afghanistan, on illegal immigration, on COVID, and on public support where his polls continue a record plunge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Joe Manchin is trying to help the Democratic Party, but Joe Biden and his radical left-wing progressives are killing the Democratic Party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , TRUMP WARNS INFLATION ‘SNOWBALLING WORSE THAN EVER’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A new 'BBB' bill won't help. A White House in denial of their failures will not help. I can only think back 25 years ago to the Bill Clinton years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Clinton got whooped badly in '94 leading to a Republican takeover of the Senate and the House after the defeat of 'Hillary Care' to nationalize the health sector and big tax hike on small business. What did Clinton do? He gave a State of the Union speech in January of '95 where he made a conservative pivot back to the center and declared that the era of big government is over. And he preceded to work with Republicans, like Newt Gingrich for dramatic welfare reform with workfare, spending restraint, a capital gains tax cut.                                      , The economy rebounded and Clinton won in '96. Clinton was a smart politician.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Rep.

So is his vice president. So is his senior staff. And so are the congressional Dem leaders. Bill Clinton and Al Gore really were moderately conservative southern Democrats. Biden and Kamala are far-left progressive coastal elites.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, slumped 2% to close at 105,019 on Monday, its lowest since December 2nd, tracking a negative sentiment in international markets due to mounting concerns over the economic impact of the fast-spreading Omicron Covid-19 variant. Locally, health authorities pointed out that despite lower cases and deaths, the possibility of a new Covid outbreak in Brazil exists due to the holiday season, the uncertainty around the Omicron strain, vaccination coverage, and public health measures. Investors also digested the massive setback to President Joe Biden's economic agenda, which prompted Goldman Sachs to cut US growth forecasts. Meanwhile, Brazil's central bank financial markets' weekly survey showed growth projections were cut again to 4.58% from 4.65% for 2021 and kept unchanged at 0.50% for 2022, while inflation forecasts were revised slightly lower to 10.04% from 10.05% for 2021, but raised marginally to 5.03% from 5.02% for 2022. </td>

It was the highest rate since October of 2008, driven by prices of manufactured products (16.0 percent vs 15.7 percent in October), electric power, gas, water &amp; waste (8.3 percent vs 6.2 percent), and agricultural, forestry &amp; marine products (5.8 percent vs 2.6 percent). Meantime, the prices of the services continued to increase by around 2.6 percent. On a monthly basis, producer prices went up 0.5 percent, the 13th consecutive monthly rise amid higher costs of energy-related products and agricultural products, which increased 1.8 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Stocks at Multi-Week Lows on Omicron Concerns </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wall Street tumbled on Monday as investors dumped travel stocks, big tech, and other growth shares, amid concerns about the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and its impact on the global economic recovery. Several countries in Europe announced movement restrictions while the US has reported more than 126K cases on Saturday. In addition, putting additional pressure on markets, US Senator Joe Manchin said he would not support President's $1.9 trillion Build Back Better Act, which would see the expansion of the US social safety net and the reduction of Americans' childcare and health care costs. The Dow ended down more than 430 points to the lowest since December 3rd. The S&amp;P fell 1.1%, making the biggest 3-day drop since September while the Nasdaq declined 1.2%. </td>

For those interested - Biden already released his speech online. 

Wait for Media to switch gears and start applauding President&amp;#39;s decision on no lockdown and great initiatives laid out to fight COVID. Might even start seeing headlines that Omicron is a sniffle flu, and nothing to worry over.

Here is an image I snapped about four years ago.  Short description for &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; next to each below:

1) Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets:  Because it&amp;#39;s the most comprehensive book on TA ever written.  You want to see how &amp;quot;data&amp;quot; is visualized on charts -- this is your book

2)  Trading in the Zone:  95% of this game is about psychology/emotions (the other 5% is basic math).  This book will help you in this arena

3)  Reminiscences of a Stock Operator:  A classic that EVERYBODY should read for inspiration.

4)  Market Wizards:  Anecdote &amp;amp; Inspiration

5)  How to Make Money in Stocks:  If you&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;swing&amp;quot; trader, this is a great book on TA.  Be careful, though -- he&amp;#39;ll try to rope you into a subscription

6) A Beginners Guide...&amp;quot;:  Phenomenal author on the topic.

Hey gang - I haven&amp;#39;t been around as much in the past few days. Just took a small break from the market while volatility chopped us around because of Omicron and the Fed.  

I know it&amp;#39;s been volatile and a lot of you are likely scratching your heads and frustrated with the market. After looking at all the data I personally don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the end just yet... good companies are now on discount. The key is to stay patient, identify those companies and take advantage of dip buy opportunities when fear rears its ugly head. A reversal is more likely now.

We&amp;#39;ve been running ongoing market volatility checks and reviewing setups on a few good names. I&amp;#39;ve attached last night&amp;#39;s video for the #SMAPro team w - this is NOT a comprehensive list. Check the first link here: https://linktr.ee/smapro

 SMA Team -  We&amp;#39;ll start to play specific names once we see behavior change and follow-through in the market. Get ready.

P.S. Futures are positive. </td>

California printing its own currency/crypto/green stamps?

The $1 billion program funded by taxpayers - as opposed to making homeowners tap into the massive equity gained in their homes while they weren&amp;#39;t making payments - was approved by the US Department of the Treasury, and will apply to as many as 40,000 struggling homeowners according to a statement from Newsom&amp;#39;s office.

&amp;quot;We are committed to supporting those hit hardest by the pandemic, and that includes homeowners who have fallen behind on their housing payments,&amp;quot; it reads. &amp;quot;No one should have to live in fear of losing the roof over their head, so we’re stepping up to support struggling homeowners to get them the resources they need to cover past due mortgage payments.&amp;quot;

Newsom noted that renters and landlords had already received assistance. </td>

Forty-eight people aboard a Royal Caribbean Symphony of the Seas, the world&amp;#39;s largest cruise ship, tested positive for COVID on Saturday after returning from a week-long cruise. 

&amp;quot;Everyone who tested positive was asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, and we continuously monitored their health,&amp;quot; Royal Caribbean told NBC Miami. &amp;quot;Each person quickly went into quarantine,&amp;quot; the statement said.

Royal Caribbean&amp;#39;s health policy requires all adults to be vaxxed with at least two shots of Pfizer or Moderna or one shot of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine. The outbreak represents 0.78% of the 6,091 passengers and crew who left Miami on Dec. 11 and sailed to Caribbean ports St. Maarten, St. Thomas, and Royal Caribbean&amp;#39;s private island, CocoCay. The cruise ship returned to homeport on Dec. 18.  

Cruise ships have been lauded as one of the safest vacations due to their strict health policies of only allowing vaxxed adults -- but as the vaccine efficacy wanes, that appears not to be the case. </td>

Another day in the books 

$1k -&amp;gt; $1m options challenge update 🚀

Start: $1,000
Current: $4,891 (389%) 
Goal: $1,000,000 sometime around February 
- 1 Trade a day
- Only SPY options
——————————————————————
Today’s SPY trade was fairly simple once again and was executed as expected.

Picked up some longer dated options as well for the new year outside of the challenge, easy to predict market lately and it has been obeying key levels to the tee. 

Just taking the challenge day by day helps, starts small but compounding is no joke, let’s keep building baby.

“Investors will monitor economic reports schedule this wk leading up to the long Christmas Holiday weekend”–Paul Ebeling 

The US stock market will be closed all day Friday in observation of Christmas Day.

The US bond market will close Thursday at 2p EST, and close Friday too. 

Between now and then, inflation data will be the Key focus. This will especially be so following the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision and updated economic and interest rate outlooks, which showed it now sees the potential for 3 interest rate hikes in Y 2022, based on its Summary of Economic Projections...

I can go to the grocery every week and see with my own eyes what is happening in the REAL WORLD! Every week the prices of food is rising unlike anything I’ve seen before. The Fed will have no choice but to act to stop inflation. I’m not a bull or a bear. I’m independent minded and try to look at things objectively! Well, this is what I’m seeing EVERY WEEK! The average American IS NOT HAPPY! I’m not talking about those on Wall St or stock market traders who live in a bubble.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $AAPL I find it interesting how a few months ago most people had never heard of the Metaverse. Now it’s how you hear about. Why though when it’s probably a decade away or more from bringing in real revenues to companies? Well, probably for the same reason that Wall St cooked up the 5G and EV narratives. These are all “ stories” being told by people on Wall St to get people hyped up to buy more and more shares. I’m not saying I’m negative on the Metaverse! No! It’s very real BUT it’s probably 10yrs away, if not more!  
 
I question the motives. I really do! I think smart money is bailing on this market as the Fed is about to raise rates and they are getting everyone else to buy their shares by hyping up these narratives and stories. </td>

-A Split of a stock is a reflection of management confidence in its stock performance boosted by upcoming known catalysts ! 

- IMO Tesla Board has approved a split waiting for proper timing once Elon is done selling (he did) 

- I wouldn’t be surprised knowing the drop in SP ~30% n the level of short volume so significantly higher to see @elonmusk pulling such plug before EOY !!  He loves shorts !!

That’s my opinion and this is how I would literally fry these short HFs —generally I’m always wrong so let’s see this time if I’m right 😁

🙏🏻🐉🦅
I command you to split !!

$RIVN RIVIAN MARKET CAP = $105 Billion - 1000 Vehicle Sales in 2021

$LCID LUCID MARKET CAP = $66 Billion - 577 Vehicle Sales in 2021

💎 $NIO MARKET CAP = $49 Billion - 83,700 Vehicle Sales 2021.

NIO announced a bombshell on NIO Day. They said by the end of 2022 they would have the capacity to produce over 600,000 Vehicles a Year. That’s over 7 times the current production numbers. Look at those numbers above and see for yourself how much NIO is undervalued right now. On top of that NIO announced that they will be in 25 Countries by 2025 and they displayed a map that shows the United States!!! The biggest news of them all is the NIO got between 40,000 - 70,000 preorders for the ET5 in just one day!!! </td>

1. In terms of driving texture, BMW is the best.
2. In terms of battery life, BMW is closest to the official battery life.
3. NIO&amp;#39;s intelligence is the best.
4. In terms of assisted driving, Tesla is the best.
5. In terms of materials, NIO is the best.
6. In terms of charging, NIO is the most convenient.
7. In terms of service, NIO is the best. 

These three vehicles represent new international forces, new Chinese forces, and traditional luxury brand electric vehicles. In summary, traditional luxury brands have their own technical accumulation in driving texture, and new forces are difficult to surpass in the short term, and the propaganda in terms of mileage is also more rigorous, but it represents that in terms of future technology, traditional luxury manufacturers do not have many prospects. </td>

The majority of the population is impoverished and illiterate. They never wear a mask or utilize social distancing. Why is there so much death and anxiety in developed countries like the United States, with social distancing, lockdown, mask use, and vaccination? This is incredibly strange and makes no sense to me.

After explaining it she now understands but said she didn&amp;#39;t want (or know) what equity was and just wanted cash.   You get where I&amp;#39;m going with this essentially Tesla is handing out coupons they say are worth $900 each and applying each share to their &amp;quot;overall offer value&amp;quot;  AND guess what, they CANT sell them for 1 year...   so if TESLA is trading at $500 next year then if Tesla were to buy the shares back they essentially got out of paying their people 25% of the &amp;quot;offered value of their salary&amp;quot;     Any thoughts guys and gals???!??!! </td>
