   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stock futures were steady on Thursday after the major averages gained further ground in the previous session, as investors digested another batch of corporate earnings results and eyed inflation data due later today for clues on the timing and magnitude of the Federal Reserve's tightening. Contracts tied to the major indices swung between small gains and losses. Shares of Disney jumped 7% in after-hours trading on an earnings beat and after doubling its revenue from its parks, experiences and consumer products division. Uber also gained 5% on strong revenues as the company bounced back from omicron-induced challenges. In regular trading on Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.08% as tech stocks led the market higher and recouped some losses from the January selloff. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.45% and the Dow edged up 0.86%.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The National Archives has asked the Department of Justice to investigate former President Donald Trump's handling of White House records, according to a source familiar with the matter.                                                                                                                                                             , The source said the Archives is seeking a review of whether Trump violated the Presidential Records Act, which requires that all records created by presidents be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administrations.                                                                                                                 , It is not clear if the Justice Department will launch a formal investigation, as a vast majority of referrals to the department do not end up sparking a formal investigation. The Justice Department declined to comment.                                                                                                                                  , The Washington Post was first to report the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In a statement Wednesday, the Archives said, "We do not comment on potential or ongoing investigations." The request came after recent revelations that the National Archives had to retrieve 15 boxes of records that had ended up with Trump in Mar-a-Lago and that other documents given to the Archives were torn up and had to be pieced back together., A person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Archives general counsel Gary Stern contacted Trump's team last fall to inquire about several boxes of records that appeared to have been taken to Mar-a-Lago during Trump's relocation to Florida.                                                                                              , These were boxes that had been in the White House residence and thus had been packed up with other personal belongings of the first family, this person said.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Additionally, some Trump White House documents that have been handed over to the House select committee investigating January 6 had to be taped back together by National Archives staff because they had been ripped up, the agency said in a statement last month.                                                                                        , The Archives, in response to questions from CNN, said that "some of the Trump presidential records received by the National Archives and Records Administration included paper records that had been torn up by former President Trump."                                                                                                                    , The agency did not explain how officials know Trump himself ripped up the records, but the Archives pointed to previous reporting that White House records management staff had to tape together torn-up documents during the Trump era.                                                                                                                    , CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated which entity could launch a formal investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , CNN's Gabby Orr, Paul LeBlanc, Ryan Nobles, Zachary Cohen and Annie Grayer contributed to this report. </td>

Fed officials regularly go to work for Wall Street after leaving the institution, making the commitment notable.                                                                     , âThese are the strongest ethics standards ever agreed to by Federal Reserve Board nominees,â Ms. Warren said in a statement on Wednesday. âU.S. Senators and the American people can be confident that these public servants will make sound economic policy decisions in the publicâs best interest.â                                                         , Republicans have been questioning Ms. Raskinâs nomination by highlighting her stint on the board of directors for a financial technology company, Reserve Trust.                                                                                                                                                                                               , The company got a critical account with the Fed â known as a master account â while Ms. Raskin was on the companyâs board. The account provided the firm with advertisable benefits, like access to the Fedâs payments system.                                                                                                                                 , During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs last week, senators questioned whether she had used her previous positions at the Fed and Treasury to help secure the account. Ms. Raskin did not confirm or deny whether she had been in touch with the companyâs local Fed bank while she sat on its board., The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which approved the master account, has said that it âdid not deviate from its review process in evaluating this request.â                                                                                                                                                                                             , Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, asked Ms. Raskin to respond in writing by Wednesday about the Reserve Trust situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Ms. Raskin, in her response, said she did ânot recall any communications I made to help Reserve Trust obtain a master account. Had I done so, I would have abided by all applicable ethics rules in such communications.â                                                                                                                                      , Amanda Thompson, the communications director for Republicans on the Banking Committee, called those responses a âcase of selective amnesia.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The White House has continued to stand behind its nominees. Christopher Meagher, a spokesman for the White House, called the Republican questioning âsmearsâ and said that they âcontinue to fall flat in the face of scrutiny and facts.â                                                                                                                     , Dr. Cook, Dr. Jefferson and Ms. Raskin are up for confirmation alongside Jerome H. Powell â who Mr. Biden renominated to be Fed chair â and Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who is the Biden administrationâs pick for vice chair.                                                                                                                               , Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the chairman of the Banking Committee, said last week that all five candidates would face a key committee vote on Feb. 15.                                                                                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

       shares rose more than 5% late Wednesday after the auto-parts retailer reported quarterly earnings and sales above Wall Street expectations, calling the quarter's performance "incredible." O'Reilly said it earned $519 million, or $7.64 a share, in the quarter, compared with $393 million, or $5.40 a share, in the same period a year ago. Sales rose 16% to $3.3 billion, the company said. FactSet consensus called for earnings of $6.06 a share on sales of $3.1 billion. O'Reilly guided for full-year 2022 sales between $14.2 billion and $14.5 billion, and EPS between $32.35 and $32.85.

, The U.S. is heading out of the "full blown pandemic phase" of COVID-19 and moving toward a point where more decisions will be made at the local level and not by the federal government, allowing restrictions such as wearing face masks to be lifted over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, extended gains for a second straight session to close 0.2% up at 112,461 on Wednesday, tracking its global peers and led by heavyweight Petrobras on rising oil prices, despite weakness in the banking sector. Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor corporate earnings while awaiting fresh US inflation figures for clues on the trajectory of the Fed's monetary policy tightening. Brazilian lender Banco Bradesco reported fourth-quarter earnings slightly below analystsâ estimates but indicated a bright outlook for 2022. Also, companies in the paper and packaging sector such as Suzano and Klabin reported fourth-quarter results. On the data front, Brazil's inflation rate decelerated in January from the previous month, as expected, but it was still the highest reading for a January month since 2016. At the same time, retail sales fell in December from the previous month but less than market estimates. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> iRobot swings to Q4 loss, says that chip shortage, shipping delays dent sales - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Shares of iRobot Corp. 
        IRBT,
        +4.07%
       tanked more than 11% in the extended session Wednesday after the maker of the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner and other products reported a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and sales fell short of estimates, saying that chip shortages, shipping delays and other supply-chain problems crimped its business. IRobot said it lost $31.5 million, or  $1.17 a share, in the quarter, contrasting with a net income of $13 million, or 46 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, iRobot lost $1.05 a share. Sales fell 16% to $455.4 million, iRobot said. Analysts polled by FactSet expected the company to report a loss of 91 cents a share on sales of $470 million.

        MAT,
        +3.83%
       rose more than 6% in the extended session Wednesday after the toy maker reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales above Wall Street expectations and said its business turnaround is "complete." Mattel said it earned $226 million, or 63 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $129 million, or 37 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 10% to 1.8 billion, Mattel said, including a 14% increase in sales in North America. That growth was thanks to dolls, including Barbie, and action figures and building sets, the toy maker said. Net sales of Mattel's American Girl doll fell 6%. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Mattel to report earnings of 30 cents a share on sales of $1.7 billion. "We have made significant progress on our transformation strategy over the last few years, and our turnaround is now complete," Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz said in a statement. Mattel guided for sales growth between 8% and 10% this year and EPS between $1.42 and $1.48. , The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has risen more than 3% this week, as it tries to recover from its recent correction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Claudia Assis is a San Francisco-based reporter for MarketWatch.

AfterÂ prices slumped in January amid cold U.S. weather and transportation bottlenecks, tight inventories ahead of peak building season areÂ helping to fuel a rebound.Â âPrices are well above trend pricing, as well as our own price forecasts,â Mark Wilde, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, said Wednesday in an email. âWe are also just heading toward spring construction season and housing market activity, so it wouldnât surprise me to see prices rally further.âWood prices have been volatile since the pandemic began and they touched record highs duringÂ a Covid-19 fueled building boom, then collapsed because sawmills ramped up production and high prices stifled demand.

The company also marked its second profitable quarter as a public company, earning $892 million largely from its investments in Grab, the Southeast Asian ride-hailing company that went public in December, and Aurora, the autonomous vehicle start-up.                           , Uber lost $968 million during the same period a year earlier and reported a loss of $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021 caused by its investment in Didi, the Chinese ride-hailing company.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Its investments in other ride-hailing companies would probably continue to cause fluctuation in its profits and losses, Uber said in its earnings report. Uberâs chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said at a December analyst event that the company would hang on to some of its strategic investments but would eventually look to sell its stake in Didi.                                       , Uberâs loss from operations for the quarter was $550 million, a 37 percent improvement from a year earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Uber said it was attracting a growing number of users by relying on its food delivery business, Uber Eats, to bring in business during spikes in coronavirus cases, when its ride-hailing business declined. Uber reported 118 million users during the fourth quarter, a 27 percent increase from a year earlier.                                                                                   , âOur results demonstrate just how far weâve come since the beginning of the pandemic,â Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement. âWhile the Omicron variant began to impact our business in late December, mobility is already starting to bounce back.â                                                                                                                                                 , Uberâs stock price was up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The growth in users sets Uber apart from its primary rival in the United States, Lyft. In an earnings report on Tuesday, Lyft said it had 18,728 users during the fourth quarter, a 49 percent increase from a year earlier but a slight decrease from the third quarter. The modest decline in users showed that the winter wave of Omicron might have presented more challenges to Lyftâs business., Still, Lyft said that its revenue had grown by 70 percent, to $969.9 million, and that its losses had improved to $258.6 million, a 43 percent change from a year earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Analysts said Uberâs and Lyftâs businesses would most likely continue to fluctuate as travel was affected by the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , âItâs going to ebb and flow,â said Tom White, a senior research analyst with the financial firm D.A. Davidson. While Lyftâs business was tied to coronavirus conditions in North America, Uber could experience other issues because it operates around the world, he added.                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

Bill Haggerty, R-Tenn., discusses Biden's Fed nominee Sarah Bloom Raskin, Biden's policies falling short of Americans' approval and the U.S. sending 3,000 troops to NATO countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , EXCLUSIVE: A coalition of House Republicans is sounding the alarm over Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Bidenâs nominee to become the Federal Reserve's top banking regulator, expressing concern that her climate regulation views could endanger the independence of the U.S. central bank and hurt working-class Americans.Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In a Wednesday letter addressed to the White House, 48 GOP lawmakers urged President Biden to reconsider his nomination of Raskin as the Fed's vice chair of supervision, warning that her past statements indicate she would "irreparably politicize the Federal Reserve and destroy what remains of its credibility and independence."                                                                                                                                                                                                           , SARAH BLOOM RASKIN OPPOSED BY 24 STATE FINANCIAL OFFICERS OVER 'RADICAL' VIEW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "We are deeply troubled by your decision to nominate Ms. Raskin, who would wield tremendous regulatory and supervisory authority that could be weaponized to discourage or prohibit banks from lending to or investing in American energy," the letter, a copy of which was first shared with FOX Business, said. "Her consistent advocacy for the Federal Reserve to de-bank energy companies raises the troubling prospect that she would do just that."                                                                                         , Sarah Bloom Raskin and U.S. Rep.

If banks and other financial institutions do not take these steps to distance themselves from fossil-fuel companies, Raskin has said, the Fed should penalize them.Â                                                                                                                                           , But Republicans warned that targeting the oil and gas industry could have irreparable side effects on working-class families â particularly those who live in energy-producing states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia.Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., spearheaded the Wednesday letter to Biden, and told FOX Business during an interview that he had three problems with Raskin: Her previously stated belief that the Fed can "pick winners and losers in the economy," her suggestion that the Fed is in a "unique position to effectuate climate change" because the institution operates independently and outside the purview of Congress, and her past criticisms of the energy sector and push to bar the industry from benefiting from coronavirus relief money., "For all those reasons, she is way too radical," Reschenthaler said. "Sheâs way too out of step with the role of the Fed. And she has a warped view of American democracy in that she wants to put more power in those that are unaccountable to the electorate."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Sarah Bloom Raskin, nominated to be vice chairman for supervision and a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, is sworn in before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb (Bill Clark/Pool via REUTERS / Reuters Photos)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Raskin has also drawn scrutiny over a May 2020 New York Times op-ed that she authored titled "Why Is the Fed Spending So Much Money on a Dying Industry?" In the op-ed, Raskin criticized the federal government for including the oil and gas industries in the initial $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package and said the Fed should adopt a long-term approach that shifted away from fossil fuels.Â                                                                                                                                          , "Given the size and scope of government intervention, we should be maximizing the publicâs return on our investment," she wrote at the time. "The Fedâs unique independence affords it a powerful role, and its mandate includes ensuring both the stability of the financial system and full employment. Climate change threatens financial stability; addressing it can create economic opportunity and more jobs."                                                                                                                              , Raskin later said she made the comments in the context of taxpayer-funded spending and would not apply it to the role of the Fed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee skewered Raskin during her confirmation hearing last week over some of her more controversial statements on challenges that climate change poses to the current financial system â and how she believes the Fed needs to respond. Raskin maintained that she believed it is "inappropriate" for the Fed to make credit decisions and allocations based on "choosing winners and losers."Â                                                                                                               , "Banks choose their borrowers. The Fed does not," she told the Senate Banking Committee. "It is inappropriate for the Fed to choose winners and losers, and to do so is not the proper institutional role of the Fed. That is a cardinal principle of Fed supervision."Â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Given the 50-50 Senate, Democrats would need to secure the support of every member of their caucus to overcome unified Republican opposition. The House does not vote on presidential nominees â which Reschenthaler acknowledged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , President Biden addresses the 76th Session of the U.N.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tennessee Valley Authority says federal law forbids power sales to utilities serving legal cannabis businesses - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Tennessee Valley Authority recently issued a statement saying that federal law prevents it from providing electricity to local power companies that in turn service legal cannabis companies. The TVA's coverage area for wholesale electricity includes three states with legal cannabis: Mississippi, Virginia and Alabama. "This is a complex and evolving issue -- which we've been following closely," said the Feb. 2 statement. The TVA said cannabis remains a Schedule I drug and that federal resources may not be used to facilitate activity that potentially violates federal law.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Hexo Corp. 
        HEXO,
        +8.41%
       said Wednesday it is cutting 180 jobs, as part of the Canada-based cannabis company's cost-cutting plan. The layoffs represent about 14% of the company's workforce, which was about 1,277, according to the latest FactSet data. Half of the layoffs are result of the previously announced closure of its Stellarton facility, and the rest are related to the reduction of back-office positions. Hexo said the cuts will lead to annual savings of about C$15 million ($11.8 million). "Today's announcement was not an easy one to make. We are working with all impacted employees to the best of our ability to ensure that they are treated fairly and provided the support necessary to assist with this transition," said Chief Executive Scott Cooper. The U.S.-listed stock rose 6.8% in afternoon trading to 69 cents. In late-January, the company said it received notice from the Nasdaq that it was not in compliance with the minimum-bid listing requirement, as the stock has closed below $1 since Dec. 10. The stock has plunged 56.9% over the past three months, while the Cannabis ETF

The White House has said that individuals should focus on the month-over-month increase, rather than the annual jump, considering "what we've seen over the last year."                                                , White House press secretary Jen Psaki answers questions during the daily White House press briefing Jan. 6, 2022, in Washington, D.C.

That's bad news for President Biden, who has seen his approval rating plunge as consumer prices rose. The White House has blamed the price spike on supply-chain bottlenecks and other pandemic-induced disruptions in the economy, while Republicans have pinned it on the president's massive spending agenda., The latest data will also have implications for the Federal Reserve ahead of its March meeting. Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled that policymakers will raise interest rates from rock-bottom levels as early as next month.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The only question now is whether it will be a quarter-basis point hike or larger. A hotter-than-expected reading on Thursday morning could pressure the Fed to consider its first half percentage-point increase since 2000.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Psaki said the president supports any decisions by the Fed to begin raising rates, even though doing so risks slowing the economy. Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumers and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.                                                                                                                                             , "The president has said he welcomes and supports [The Fed's] efforts to take steps with their plans in terms of our confidence," Psaki said. "We, again, rely on what their projections are that inflation will come down, that it will moderate, and we are also continuing to take steps to continue to grow the economy and continue to address the needs that the American people have in the economy." </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)A child's tooth unearthed from a French cave has revealed the earliest evidence of humans -- Homo sapiens -- living in western Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The discovery of the molar from Grotte Mandrin, near Malataverne in the RhÃ´ne Valley in southern France, along with hundreds of stone tools dating back about 54,000 years ago, suggests that early humans lived in Europe about 10,000 years earlier than archaeologists had previously thought.                                                                                                       , What's more, the Homo sapiens tooth was sandwiched between layers of Neanderthal remains, showing that the two groups of humans coexisted in the region. These findings challenge the narrative that the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe triggered the extinction of Neanderthals, who lived in Europe and parts of Asia for about 300,000 years before disappearing.                                 , "We've often thought that the arrival of modern humans in Europe led to the pretty rapid demise of Neanderthals, but this new evidence suggests that both the appearance of modern humans in Europe and disappearance of Neanderthals is much more complex than that," said study coauthor Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader in human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London.  , It's the first time archaeologists have found evidence of alternating groups of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals living in the same place, and they rotated rapidly, even abruptly, at least twice, according to the study that published in the journal Science Advances on Wednesday.                                                                                                                    , Previously, the arrival of early humans in Europe was dated to between 43,000 and 45,000 years ago, according to remains found in Italy and Bulgaria -- not long before the last surviving Neanderthal remains dating back 40,000 to 42,000 years ago were found. This time frame had led many to think the arrival of Homo sapiens and the disappearance of Neanderthals were inexorably linked.       , Humans and Neanderthals, who we know from genetic analysis encountered one another and had babies, resulting in Neanderthal traces in our DNA, overlapped for a much longer period in Europe, this study suggests.                                                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Clues from ancient stone tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Did humans and Neanderthals hang out together in this French cave overlooking the RhÃ´ne valley? The researchers don't have any hard evidence of interaction between the two groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The tools found in the layers representing the Homo sapiens and Neanderthal occupations are distinct in style and don't show any sign that they taught one another knapping or flaking stonework techniques. The stone tools associated with humans, known as Neronian tools, are smaller than those used by Neanderthals, known as Mousterian tools.                                                   , But the authors feel that it's likely that the two groups must have bumped into one another in the neighborhood -- even if direct contact didn't take place in this particular cave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The hundreds of stone tools found at the site suggest that the rock shelter was occupied intensively by both groups of humans -- and was not just a place for an occasional stopover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Astonishingly, the team was able to determine that the period between the Neanderthals relocating and the first modern humans moving into the cave 56,000 years ago was just one year. The researchers did this by mapping and analyzing soot deposits from fires made by humans in the cave.                                                                                                           , "The soot is deposited to the roof of the rock shelter, and when there was a period of no one living there, there's no soot deposition," explained Stringer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Lead author Ludovic Slimak, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and the University of Toulouse who has been working on the site for 30 years, said he believed the two groups must have exchanged knowledge in some way.                                                                                                                                                 , Right from the beginning of their occupation, Slimak said, the modern humans were using flint sourced from hundreds of kilometers away, the stone tools found in the cave show. That knowledge likely came from the indigenous Neanderthals, Slimak explained.                                                                                                                                          , "The territory appears to be immediately well known by Homo sapiens, and they immediately know flint sources that are very localized," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "What precisely was the interaction? We just don't know. We have no idea whether it was good relationship or a bad relationship. Was it a group exchange or did they have (Neanderthal) scouts to show and guide them?"                                                                                                                                                                                 , The researchers dated the site's layers using radiocarbon and luminescence techniques, which measure the last time grains of mineral in rock were exposed to sunlight. The layer containing the Homo sapiens child's tooth spans 56,800 to 51,700 years ago. In different layers, the scientists discovered eight other teeth that belonged to Neanderthals.                                            , Untangling the human story is a complicated endeavor, but it's largely accepted that modern humans originated in Africa and made their first successful migration to the rest of the world in a single wave between 50,000 and 70,000 years ago.                                                                                                                                                        , Different ancient hominins existed and coexisted before Homo sapiens emerged as the lone survivor, and there was interbreeding between different groups of early humans. Some of these groups -- like Neanderthals -- are easily identified through the fossil record and archaeological remains, but others -- like the Denisovans -- have been largely identified by their genetic legacy.            , DNA could flesh out the story                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne Moncel, a research director at the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris, said that the discovery of just one modern human tooth wasn't enough to definitively push back the dates of the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe. She said other fossilized human remains were needed to be sure of this paper's findings.                                                         , "Teeth are not enough, we must find post-cranial or cranial remains to be sure," said Moncel, who wasn't involved in the research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , It's possible that DNA -- either directly from the teeth or through groundbreaking new techniques that allow DNA found in sediment to be sequenced -- could flesh out the story and tell us how the pioneering group of early modern humans were related to the ones that arrived later and whether the Neanderthals who lived in the cave had the same origins.                                        , The DNA might show evidence of interbreeding between the two groups. In Bacho Kiro cave in Bulgaria, where the previously oldest evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe was found, the DNA of those early modern humans was about 3% Neanderthal.                                                                                                                                                           , Teeth preserve well in the fossil record, and their bumps and groves are a bit like fingerprints for archaeologists, giving clues to ancestry and behavior. The shape of the tooth and its internal structure strongly suggested it belong to a modern human child even though the tooth was damaged, the researchers said.                                                                             , </td>

Bank of France Governor de Galhau stated investors may have overreacted to what was seen as a hawkish pivot by the ECB. At the same time, the Swiss National Bank remains committed to its ultra-loose monetary policy, as the latest labor data indicated that unemployment did not increase despite the Covid infection wave in January, while consumer inflation remains moderate. In its latest survey economic survey of Switzerland, the OECD noted that the Swiss economy proved to be very resilient to the ongoing health crisis and should be in no rush to tighten monetary policy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> SpaceX will lose up to 40 satellites it just launched due to a solar storm - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN Business)Up to 40 of SpaceX's Starlink satellites are expected to fall out of orbit thanks to some inopportune timing: The company launched the satellites directly into a solar storm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , A batch of 49 Starlink internet satellites were on SpaceX's latest launch on February 3, and now the company is expecting to lose most of them because they hit a space weather event known as a geomagnetic storm. This event occurs when streams of charged particles, or solar winds, emitted from the sun interact with Earth's magnetic field. The energized particles can heat up the upper atmosphere, causing it to thicken. (Yes, there is still atmosphere in areas of outer space closest to home. The Earth's atmosphere fades out over thousands of miles.)                                                               , In this case, the storm impacted the area of orbit where SpaceX's newest Starlink satellites were deployed, and it made the atmosphere dense enough that the satellites weren't able to maneuver their way up to their intended orbit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , It's not clear how large the financial impact will be. SpaceX has not shared how much it costs to build a Starlink satellite, though the company's president, Gwynne Shotwell, said in 2019 that the price was well below $1 million a piece.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The satellites that SpaceX launched last week were expected to join roughly 2,000 Starlink satellites that it has already launched as the company works to drastically ramp up its global space-based internet business â a first-of-its-kind venture that hopes to allow people in even the most remote areas of the world to gain high-speed internet access. SpaceX has said it will eventually need as many as 42,000 satellites, all working in coordination to blanket the globe in connectivity, in order to deliver high-speed, uninterrupted service. As of January, the service had about 145,000 users across 25 countries. , It's not totally clear how SpaceX evaluated the weather in space ahead of last week's launch. The company did not respond to a request for comment, and rarely responds to reporters' inquiries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , But rocket launches have been delayed for space weather events before, said Bill Murtagh, the program coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center. And launch officials routinely keep a close eye on space weather before rockets take off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Different companies have their own criteria" for deciding whether or not a space weather event will impact their launch, Murtagh added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , James Spann, the head of space weather within NASA's division that studies the sun, also said that it's difficult to predict exactly how such a geomagnetic storm could've impacted Starlink. Because the storm wasn't all the severe, it's not unreasonable to think it would not have had an impact on the launch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , And though the loss of 40 satellites isn't ideal, Spann emphasized that the data NASA and NOAA will gain from observing how the Starlink satellites reacted the storm will help improve space weather modeling in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "That is the silver lining," he told CNN Business. "We're going to use the data points to ensure that in the future the chances of success are even better than they already are now."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Still, GPS data from the Starlink satellites "suggests the escalation speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50% higher than during previous launches," SpaceX wrote in an update on its website. "The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize dragâto effectively 'take cover from the storm,'" according to the company.                                                                                                                                                                                         , But early data suggests that the added drag from the storm prevented the satellites from turning off the safe mode and "up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth's atmosphere," the SpaceX post reads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The company noted that the failed satellites shouldn't pose any risk to other satellites during their descent, and they should disintegrate as they slam into the thickest part of Earth's atmosphere so that they don't threaten any people or property on the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , All of those safety measures are by design, the company said. SpaceX has said it intentionally deploys its Starlink satellites at a lower altitude than their intended orbit so that if a satellite malfunctions, it wouldn't be left to fly uncontrolled through orbit for very long â a key space debris mitigation effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But deploying at a lower altitude may also be a key reason that these Starlink satellites were so badly affected by the geomagnetic storm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , And in a new filing with the Federal Communications Commission, which must approve satellite launches, NASA raised concerns that the sheer number of satellites that SpaceX has proposed could become a threat to the International Space Station and other important assets in space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , It's all about space weather                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Every decade or so, the sun completes a solar cycle of calm and stormy activity and begins a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Eruptions like solar flares and coronal mass ejection events â when the sun's outermost atmosphere spits out plasma and magnetic fields â can impact the power grid, satellites, GPS, airlines, rockets and astronauts in space. Space weather is known to cause disruptions in earthly communications systems by affecting radio frequencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Our current solar cycle, Solar Cycle 25, officially began in December 2019. Right now, we're leaving a period of relative calm and the current cycle is expected to reach its most active space weather phase in 2025.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , On a scale from one to five, the geomagnetic storm that affected the Starlink satellites last week was a two, which is fairly mild, Murtagh said. The sun puts off "several hundred" storms of that magnitude every 11-year solar cycle, Murtagh said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The beautiful visible manifestation [of space weather] is the northern lights that everyone loves â that's the nice, pretty part. But the consequences, as we found out on Friday, can be quite significant to some of these technologies," Murtagh said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , CNN's Ashley Strickland contributed </td>

The service had 3.6 billion hours streamed in 2021, a 40% increase from 2020. Fox has been investing in more original content for Tubi, as well as beefing up its library.                                                                                                                                      , Revenue at Fox increased nearly 9% to $4.44 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, topping analystsâ consensus expectations of $4.25 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Foxâs advertising revenue rose about 6% over last year due to pricing strength at its Fox network, as well as from live sports and Tubi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The companyâs cable programming unit, which includes the Fox Business Network and Fox Sports 1 channel as well as Fox News, generated $1.64 billion in revenue, a 10% increase from the same quarter last year. Contractual price increases, including distribution agreement renewals, helped boost affiliate revenues. Advertising revenue also increased at the division thanks to pricing power at Fox News and its national sports networks.    , Fox Nation, the direct-to-consumer streaming platform operated by Fox News, logged higher subscription revenue compared with last year. The recently launched Fox Weather also landed new distribution deals with YouTubeTV, Amazon News and Roku.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Revenue from Foxâs TV stations rose to $2.76 billion from $2.56 billion in the year-earlier period due to an increase in advertising revenues, which benefited from live sports, growth at Tubi and the continuing recovery from Covid-19 restrictions in local markets.                                                                                                                                                                             , The company recorded higher expenses in the segment as it recognized higher sports and entertainment-programming rights amortization at the Fox network and increased its digital spending at Tubi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Fox News parent Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp share common ownership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Main entrance to News Corporation / Fox News headquarters in New York.Â  (Â Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The company posted a loss attributable to stockholders of $85 million, or 15 cents a share, for the fiscal second quarter, compared with a profit of $224 million, or 37 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Fox Corp. attributed the loss to a change in the fair value of its investment in the sports betting and gaming provider Flutter Entertainment PLC.

        +0.29%
       said Wednesday that it targets energy generated from coal to be just 5% of total energy generation by 2030, and aims at a full exit from coal by 2035. Currently, the company coal fuel represents about 27% of its total energy generation. The electric utility said the targets are part of an expansion of its clean energy action plan, in which its 2050 net-zero goals now include Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. Scope 2 emissions include indirect emissions from power the company purchases from others and Scope 3 emissions include indirect emissions from others in the company's value chain. The company said it has already retired 56 coal units, representing 7,500 megawatts, since 2010, and expects to retire an additional 862 megawatts by 2024. Duke Energy's stock, which tacked on 0.2% in afternoon trading, has gained 2.7% over the past 3 months, while the SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF [s:xlu] has advanced 3.3% and the S&amp;P 500

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fed's Mester says 'each meeting is going to be in play' for rate hikes this year </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester laid out an aggressive plan for reducing easy-money policies this year, saying the central bank will be ready to hike rates at any meeting and should be looking at shedding mortgage-backed securities it is holding.                                                         , "Each meeting is going to be in play," Mester said Wednesday at a virtual event hosted by the European Economics and Financial Centre. "We're going to assess conditions, we're going to assess how the economy's evolving, we're going to be looking at the risks, and we're going to be removing accommodation."                , Her comments come with markets widely expecting the Fed to raise its benchmark short-term borrowing rate at its March meeting. Traders are pricing in at least four more increases through the course of the year.                                                                                                                , Mester said she sees a March hike lately but doesn't expect to raise the rate by more than 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point, as is the norm. But she was emphatic that it's time for the central bank to start reversing the historically accommodative measures it took during the Covid pandemic crisis.          , "I don't like taking anything off the table," she said. "I don't think there's any compelling case to start with a 50 basis point [increase]. Again, we've got to be a little bit careful. Even though you can well telegraph what's coming, when you take that first action, there's going to be a reaction."                    , Mester is a voting member this year of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates and other monetary policy measures. She noted she will be watching inflation closely. If it declines over the course of the year, that would lead to fewer rate hikes, while an acceleration would prompt more hawkish action., Morgan Stanley picks Asia chip stocks that will be in 'pole position' when tech speeds up again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Bill Miller says he's thinking about buying Peloton.

The central bank's total balance sheet is close to $9 trillion, having doubled during the pandemic.                                                                                 , The Fed is likely to allow some of the proceeds from its holdings to roll off each month while reinvesting the rest. However, Mester advocated a more active approach, in which the Fed would sell outright some of the $2.66 trillion in mortgage-backed securities it is holding.                                               , In the last balance sheet reduction, which ran from 2017 to 2019, it used a passive roll-off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Like other officials, Mester noted the conditions are different this time: The holdings are far larger and the economy is in a stronger position, so the balance sheet reduction can be done more quickly.                                                                                                                        , She advocated that the central bank shed its mortgage holdings and focus on the Treasury market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "I do think it's important that the Fed not be allocating its credit to particular sectors," Mester said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Fed's monthly asset purchases have been cut back to $60 billion and are expected to end completely by March. Market opinion is coalescing around the balance sheet reduction beginning in the summer.                                                                                                                         , Earlier in the day, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic also called for several rate hikes this year and a quick reduction of the balance sheet holdings.                                                                                                                                                                        , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the French 10-year OAT eased to below 0.7% from the two-year high of 0.74% touched on February 8th, amid eased fears of accelerated monetary policy tightening after ECB policymakers suggested the central bank is not as hawkish as previously thought. Bank of France Governor Francois Velleroy de Galhau suggested that investors might have overreacted to comments made by ECB policymakers following the bankâs meeting this month, while President Lagarde emphasized that policy tightening would be gradual and only begin after the end of bond purchases. Meanwhile, data from INSEE suggests that the growth in the French economy will slow in the first quarter of 2022 due to restrictions brought by the wave of coronavirus cases the country faced. Early estimates believe the French GDP will grow by 0.3% on the quarter during Q1, while the economy is expected to grow by 0.6% during Q2. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Tax season is underway â and the IRS is warning of a likely increase in scams targeting taxpayers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Agency officials are sounding the alarm on "IRS impersonation scams," in which criminals pose as IRS agents to try stealing money or personal information. The latter can lead to identity theft â which allows crooks to file tax returns in victims' names and steal their tax refund, in addition to other negative financial effects., Common frauds this tax season may include text-message scams, e-mail schemes, phone scams and unemployment fraud, according to an IRS bulletin issued Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                          , More from Personal Finance:Here's who can file taxes to the IRS for free this yearFeds won't seize child tax credit for past-due student loansWhat to know about tax credits and deductions                                                                                                                                              , These cons can happen throughout the year, but tax season is an especially ripe time for fraudsters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "With filing season underway, this is a prime period for identity thieves to hit people with realistic-looking emails and texts about their tax returns and refunds," IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in the memo.                                                                                                                    , Here are some common scams to watch for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Text hoaxes involve messages with bogus links that claims to be IRS websites or other online tools. Last year, for example, there was an increase in texts referencing Covid-19 and stimulus payments.                                                                                                                                   , The IRS doesn't use texts (or social media platforms) to discuss personal tax issues, such as bills or refunds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "The IRS reminds everyone NOT to click links or open attachments in unsolicited, suspicious or unexpected text messages â whether from the IRS, state tax agencies or others in the tax community," according to the agency bulletin.                                                                                                    , E-mail schemes are similar â they involve victims getting an unsolicited message appearing to be from the IRS or a program closely linked to the agency.

However, the IRS will generally first mail a bill to taxpayers, according to the agency. And all tax payments should never be made payable to third parties â only to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.                                                                       , The IRS will never ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone, or demand immediate payment using a specific payment method like prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer.

But she said firms urgently needed more information about which ports would process which products after 1 July.                                                                                                                                             , "Of course you need advance notice to act on this information," said Ms Laouadi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Without it "the system could potentially grind to halt" she said, with up to 29-mile-long queues at UK ports this summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In January new post-Brexit checks on goods contributed to tail-backs in Kent, due to teething troubles around the new paperwork required, Ms Laouadi said.                                                                                                                                                                                             , The MPs' report said increased costs, delays and paperwork were making it harder for UK businesses to trade as before, and while it was difficult to disentangle the impact of Covid and global economic problems, the cross party committee found Brexit had reduced the UK's trade with the EU.                                                      , John Grayson said things were already "verging on the impossible, logistically and financially" for his business, Earth Natural Foods in London.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , He has given up importing directly from EU suppliers and has dropped some specific products altogether, like one particular brand of olive oil.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , He relies on importers instead, but an order takes three weeks to arrive instead of one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "A one tonne pallet of goods that used to cost Â£200, is now near to Â£600," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Mary Quicke, an artisan cheesemaker based in Devon said she now worries that her EU customers will run out of patience and stop taking her products if these kinds of problems persist.                                                                                                                                                                , "There are just all of these barriers to doing what used to be really, really simple which was agreeing to make a sale and then calling the haulier and off it went and you got paid," she told BBC 5 Live.                                                                                                                                            , "Of course they want our cheese, but how long do you carry on doing something you want when it's really tedious and costly and you get charged much more money?"                                                                                                                                                                                       , From 1 July extra checks on agricultural and food imports from the EU will take place at ports around the UK, but with products varying from cut flowers to ready-made lasagne, firms need to know which ports will be authorised to process which products, what the operating hours will be and how they fit with ferry schedules, Logistics UK said., The Public Accounts Committee noted that some of the required infrastructure will not be completed in time and there were still concerns around staffing, including vets.                                                                                                                                                                              , In addition, later this year travellers including HGV drivers entering the EU will need to go through biometric passport checks, involve facial recognition and fingerprint scans, as part of the EU's Entry and Exit System.                                                                                                                          , Ports such as Dover, where EU-entry checks take place on the UK side, therefore need to be adapted to avoid drivers having to get out of their vehicles and walk across lanes of traffic, Ms Laouadi said.                                                                                                                                             , The Public Accounts Committee said it was particularly concerned about what would happen when passenger traffic across the UK border returns to normal levels as the pandemic subsides.                                                                                                                                                                , The PAC report urges the government to write to the committee, within six months, setting out the timetable for its planned programme of work on the "noteworthy ambition" to create the world's most effective border by 2025.                                                                                                                        , A government spokeswoman said: "Traders have adapted well to the introduction of full customs controls on 1 January, with minimal disruption at the border and inbound freight flowing effectively through ports.                                                                                                                                      , "We are continuing to ensure that businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets, including one-to-one advice through the free-to-use Export Support Service."                                                                    , This report serves as a reminder that in leaving the European Union, the UK did something that no other modern economy has really done before.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , It created permanent barriers to trade with its nearest neighbours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , That may not have been the motivation for Brexit, not its intended purpose. But it has been the practical effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , It means small businesses in particular, which used to trade with the rest of Europe as easily as they trade with other parts of the country, have suddenly been caught in a thicket of bureaucracy.                                                                                                                                                   , But this is not just about companies that are finding it more difficult to trade. It's about companies that have given up exporting altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , There is less trade now between Britain and Europe than there used to be, and it hasn't bounced back from Covid lockdowns in the way that trade between other countries has.                                                                                                                                                                           , The government says it's time to look at new markets on the other side of the world instead. But that is a very long-term plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , If you have a business, has it been affected by Brexit or not?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The CAC 40 Index held to early gains to close 1.5% higher at 7,131 on Wednesday, extending its rally to three consecutive sessions amid eased bond yields and strong performances in the tech and auto sectors after ECB President Lagarde said policy tightening would be gradual and only begin after the end of bond purchases. Tech shares rose 2.8%, led by STMicroelectronics (4.2%) and Atos (2.2%). The auto sector also traded in the green, as seen in Stellantis (4.1%) and Renault (2.3%) after Nissan Motor raised its operating profit target to JPY 210 billion for its fiscal year ending in March, compared to the JPY 180 billion previously estimated. Lastly, Amundi jumped 3.9% after reporting it already exceeded its strategic objectives for 2022 along with a sharp increase in revenue during 2021. </td>

It was the highest inflation rate since October of 2017. Main upward pressure came from prices of food &amp; non-alcoholic beverages (10.9 percent vs 9.8 percent in December), restaurants &amp; hotels (9.1 percent vs 7.2 percent), housing &amp; utilities (8.7 percent vs 9.3 percent), transport (8.1 percent vs 5.1 percent) and education (7.3 percent vs 3.6 percent). On a monthly basis, consumer prices were up 2.2 percent, the most since January of 2017, after a 1.5 percent rise in the prior month. </td>

But the companyâs vast cable television business continued to shrink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , By Brooks Barnes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , LOS ANGELES â Disney+ added 11.8 million subscribers worldwide in its most recent quarter to reach 129.8 million, handily beating analyst expectations, as growth at the Disney-owned services Hulu and ESPN+ pushed its portfolio toward 200 million total subscribers.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Walt Disney Companyâs quarterly disclosure of subscriber numbers on Wednesday instantly eased investor concerns about slowing growth of Disney+, which had missed analyst projections in November.

But some of the froth has evaporated as services have proliferated, making it harder for companies to meet growth expectations and resulting in overwhelmed consumers: Some of the thrill of having thousands of shows and films at oneâs fingertips is gone. Analysts have also worried that the boom that services enjoyed during the coronavirus pandemic will come to an end.        , Last month, Netflix said it had added 8.3 million subscribers in its most recent quarter, instead of the projected 8.5 million, and forecast a slowdown for the current quarter compared with a year earlier. Netflix shares cratered 20 percent, dragging down Disney and other media companies with them. Netflix has 222 million subscribers worldwide.                                                                                                                    , âThere is a lot of concern in the market about streaming all of a sudden,â Michael Nathanson, a leading media analyst, said last week. âPeople are more negative than they have been.â                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Nathanson added that Disney+ needed to offer more content for people who were not Marvel or âStar Warsâ fans and who didnât have children. Notably, one of the standout offerings on Disney+ last quarter was Peter Jacksonâs documentary series âThe Beatles: Get Back.â That offering alone drove 209,000 Disney+ sign-ups in its three-day opening period, according to Antenna, a research company.                                                                   , Bob Chapek, Disneyâs chief executive, told analysts on a post-earnings conference call that the amount of âgeneral entertainmentâ programming on Disney+ would increase. On Wednesday, for instance, Disney+ began offering reruns of two ABC comedies, âblack-ishâ and âThe Wonder Years,â both of which previously streamed on Hulu.                                                                                                                                        , When Disney+ was introduced in 2019, the company spent a lot of time worrying about whether certain boundary-pushing shows â ones geared toward older viewers â were appropriate to include. Early on, Disney pulled the plug on a much-anticipated âLizzie McGuireâ reboot because executives thought story lines were not child-friendly enough, for instance.                                                                                                              , Mr. Chapek, who took over from Robert A. Iger in 2020, indicated that he was willing to think outside the box. âWhat we have seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit,â Mr. Chapek said on the conference call. He added that more than half of Disney+ subscribers do not have children.                                                                                                   , At the same time, Mr. Chapek highlighted the recent success of the animated musical âEncanto,â which arrived on Disney+ just before the quarter ended. âThe Book of Boba Fett,â a limited series set in the âStar Warsâ universe, also began rolling out on Disney+ in December, with the company hoping to build on the momentum of âThe Mandalorian,â one of the serviceâs top performers. Another âStar Warsâ series, âObi-Wan Kenobi,â will arrive on May 25.             , Disney said it had logged $4.7 billion in total streaming revenue in the most recent quarter, up 34 percent from a year earlier, in part because Hulu, which Disney owns with Comcast, raised subscription prices. Nonetheless, Disneyâs streaming division lost roughly $600 million â about 27 percent more than a year earlier â because of costs that included content production, marketing and technology infrastructure.                                               , Operating profit at Disney Parks, Experiences and Products totaled $2.45 billion, compared with a loss of $119 million a year earlier, when some of Disneyâs properties were closed because of the pandemic and others, including Walt Disney World, were capping daily attendance. Disney cited the return of its cruise line, albeit with limited capacity, as another reason for the divisionâs rebound.                                                                   , Higher prices at Disney parks also helped, as did the introduction of a digital tool, Genie+, that allows park visitors to drastically shorten ride wait times. It costs $15 at Disney World in Florida and $20 at Disneyland in California.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , âWe have been blown away,â Mr. Chapek said of Genie+ purchases. (Disney Worldâs previous line-skipping system was free.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Christine M. McCarthy, Disneyâs chief financial officer, noted that attendance was strong at Disney World even though âwe havenât yet seen the return of our international guests.â Overseas visitors accounted for roughly 20 percent of the resortâs attendance before the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                        , Underscoring the importance of streaming growth to Disneyâs future: Operating profit from broadcast and cable television, the companyâs largest division, totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter, a 13 percent decline from $1.7 billion a year earlier. Disney attributed the decrease to higher content production and marketing costs and less political advertising at local stations. The division includes ESPN, ABC, Disney Channel, FX, Freeform and National Geographic., Mr. Chapek seemed to go out of his way to talk up the future of ESPN, including his excitement about an expected entry into sports betting â a signal that Disney has no plans to spin off ESPN, despite persistent speculation to the contrary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , All told, Disney made $1.15 billion in profit in the quarter, compared with $29 million in the same quarter in 2020.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Copper futures climbed to $4.5 per tonne, the highest in four weeks boosted by concerns about supply disruptions and thin inventories. MMG Ltd said production at its Las Bambas copper mine in Peru may stop by February 20th after a local community blocked again a road used by the miner, causing the company to curtail operations. Also, China's National Development and Reform Commission outlined plans to bolster the construction of new infrastructure, a source of copper demand.

And so there's a general conventional wisdom that when the Fed raises interest rates, all interest rates go up and when you look back at the last seven tightening cycles since 1980. That was true in five of those cycles. Long-term interest rates did rise in two of them. However, that was not the case. And so weâ¦ dug in and looked into what was the difference in those two cycles where rates didn't rise compared to those other five? And the one thing that was very clear it was all about the momentum in the economy. And so the where the Fed is starting this tightening cycle next month, is going to be basically at the beginning of a downtrend in global growth as measured by earnings, PMI'S, confidence, business confidence. And so you really have to look at those two periods that were the exception were actually long term rates declined with the slowdown, rather than those other five examples where the economy was just starting to re-accelerate. And so, yeah, I think financials, which is by far the most popularâ¦ sector on the street, maybe next to energy is most at risk here as investors have been heavily tilted their portfolios in 2022 toward stocks that would benefit from higher rates. And if rates stop going up as we believe that's going to be imminent, and even decline in the back half of this year, then those positions are going to be underperforming, most likely., GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz provides his economic outlook and discusses how the market will respond to the Federal Reserveâs interest rate hikes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the Italian 10-year BTP eased to 1.8% from the 20-month high of 1.9% touched on February 7th, in line with European counterparts, as fears of accelerated monetary policy tightening eased after ECB policymakers suggested the central bank is not as hawkish as previously thought. Bank of France Governor Francois Velleroy de Galhau suggested that investors might have overreacted to comments made by ECB policymakers following the bankâs meeting this month, while President Lagarde emphasized that policy tightening would be gradual and only begin after the end of bond purchases. In the meantime, investors remain attentive with Italyâs political future and large debt. While Sergio Mattarellaâs re-election as head of state guaranteed political stability in the short-term, the lack of consensus displayed by the Italian lawmakers raised concerns over the governmentâs ability to efficiently implement reforms with EU funds amid higher borrowing costs. </td>

The worldâs largest exporters of processed soy, Argentina and Brazil, have been facing this season hot and dry conditions, which are set to substantially affect the quality and quantity of crops. Brazil is expected to export 7.5 million tonnes of soybeans in February, down from 9.923 million tonnes projected the week prior by farm consultancy ANEC. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South African Rand Firmer </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The South African rand was trading around 15.3 against USD, after hitting an over one-week low of 15.5 on February 7th, amid a downtick in the dollar and due to some relief after power utility Eskom suspended its latest power cuts. South Africaâs economy has been hit by energy shortages as power utility Eskom struggles to address long-standing operational and financial challenges, with the emergency program to add generation from private producers experiencing multiple delays. Meanwhile, the country's economic outlook remains fragile amid the uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic, higher inflation and interest rates, as well as policy uncertainty. Also, the prospect of a faster policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve limited further gains. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wholesale inventories in the US advanced 2.2 percent month-over-month to $789.4 billion in December of 2021, up from a 1.7 percent increase in the prior month and above a preliminary estimate of 2.1 percent. It was the 17th consecutive month of gains, amid increases in inventories of both durable goods (2.6 percent vs 2.6 percent in November) and nondurable ones (1.6 percent vs 0.4 percent). On a yearly basis, wholesale inventories advanced 18.5 percent in December. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> South Africaâs SACCI business confidence index rose to a three-month high of 94.1 in January of 2022 from 92 in December, as external trade and retail sales recovered following the easing of Covid-19 restrictions and the end of the travel ban imposed by several countries after the discovery of the Omicron variant. Stronger new-vehicle sales and higher share prices also supported this level of confidence, while rising inflation and higher debt servicing costs had a negative impact. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canadaâs main stock index, the S&amp;P/TSX, briefly hit a ten-week high before settling around 21,500 on Wednesday, a level not seen since November 25th, as upbeat earnings reignited investorsâ appetite for risk. Meanwhile, a protest of Canadian truck drivers in downtown Toronto entered its twelfth day, which has left authorities struggling to find ways to put an end to the protest. On the earnings front, investors await Q4 results for Manulife Financial and Sun Life Financial after markets close. On corporate updates, National Bank analysts raised the target of TFI International to C$160 from a prior C$153 per share. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> All three major US stock indexes gained further ground Wednesday as investors digested another batch of corporate earnings results and eyed inflation data on Thursday for clues on the Federal Reserve's plans to hike interest rates. Gains were most pronounced in those growth-oriented stocks, with Meta, Tesla and Microsoft up about 2% each, while Chipmaker AMD added more than 1% after an upgrade from Daiwa Capital Markets. On the data front, mortgage applications in the US sank 8.1% in the week ended February 4th, the biggest decline in almost a year as buyers started to pull back faced with rising mortgage rates. </td>

That means we will see a $459 algo pump in the morning to get more bulls trapped, and then an afternoon dump down to below $450 to fill the gap.  Then panic selling on Friday down to $439..  That will start Wave C of Wave 4.  Bottom should be around $400 on March 2nd. </td>

SPY is going to remain bullish heavily above the closing week pivot 446.07 as alerted, 
virtually leaving puts worthless feeding them small dips to maintain liquidity.  
After 150 matching ticks within DASH I took notice that SPY price pull was determining  the  
frequency of buy interest within DASH that&amp;#39;s why DASH had delayed pumps, so swinging along SPY calls 
was a no brainer.  
 
Earlier today (11:12AM) just after taking heavy profits off SPY swing I dipped in for the reset fade which  
I identified was forming a bear trap for greedy short remembering 446.07 is the ultimate bearish 
pivot 
 
I scaled GOOGL patiently after ER as its forming the same agro flow pattern as TSLA did into the 
new year and opened New years day for 1200 pump. GOOGL showed no aggressive downside interest alongside 
NASADAQ which is also chasing its 10 &amp;amp; 20 day high 15,260. GOOGL has not yet set its cash session highs.

Essaye and Invesco&amp;#39;s Hooper agree that investors won&amp;#39;t only be parsing Thursday&amp;#39;s CPI data for clues. Inflation expectations are also crucial, ensuring that investors will pay close heed to the University of Michigan&amp;#39;s preliminary February read onthe subject Friday morning.  
 
That data could, in fact, prove more important, Hooper said, after the New York Fed&amp;#39;s inflation-expectations for the next one and three years remained elevated in December, but appeared to peak. The data showed median expectations one-year expectations unchanged at 6% and three-year expectations steady at 4%.  
 
&amp;quot;We would want to see the same from the Michigan data,&amp;quot; she said, noting that January data from the New York Fed won&amp;#39;t be seen until Monday.  
 
Essaye is less sanguine about the outlook, noting that all the measures of inflation expectations monitored by his firm are in areas that indicate the Fed needs to be hawkish, even with five-year inflation breakevens pulling back from recent highs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ What a great day! This is very tricky tbh. If the gap remmains open chances we will go above 4748 before we pullback. If this has to happen then tomorrow we should open flat and go down not far from today&amp;#39;s low.  
If we gap down we should not break 4465, otherwise lower prices are likely. In this case we may form a wedge before exploding to the upside, just like $XBI (see pic). 
$XBI moves when you expect it the least. I sold few of my calls too early, hope to get back at the same price. Looks like a breakout to me, the volume is great (see pic), but $XBI is a B, it&amp;#39;s faking it a lot! If this decides to move up it won&amp;#39;t pullback a lot and the rising trendline should hold until the end of the move.

&amp;quot;The U.S. central bank began tapering in November 2021, scaling back total purchases by $15 billion a month, from $120 billion to $105 billion. The Fed decided to double the pace at which it tapers on Dec. 15. Rather than $15 billion, the Fed will reduce purchases by $30 billion every month.&amp;quot;   
   
So approximately...   
 
Oct         120  Billion 
Nov        105  Billion 
Dec        82.5  Billion 
Jan        52.5  Billion 
Feb        22.5  Billion 
Mar        taper complete   
   
   
Obviously JPOW is full of shit.    
   
It&amp;#39;s also interesting there is not a single article anywhere discussing the ACTUAL taper amounts the last few months. That&amp;#39;s not coincidence. </td>

1. $RBLX- NFL news, nice daily candle, with volume, looks ready to keep pushing up. 30min chart closed above a key level at 69.8. Bullish on this. 

2. $COST- rejected by weekly resistance and closed right on it. Looking for a clean break over 529/530 to swing calls into next week or otherwise we could start seeing some downside again. 

3. $JD- 4hr showing inverse head and shoulders. Could be a nice swing heading into next week. Todays daily candle closed right on daily resistance so weâll see if we can get a push up. 

4. $AAPL- showing inverse head and shoulders on daily. Waiting for a clean break of 177 area to go long on calls targeting ATH. One of the cleaner set ups imo.

Why 8 State Treasurers Are Asking The SEC To Investigate Apple 
February 09, 2022 1:18pm  
 
Why It&amp;#39;s Important: The SEC could initiate a probe into whether Apple&amp;#39;s non-disclosure agreement violates SEC&amp;#39;s anti-gag rules, according to Zuckerman Law, a Washington, D.C.-based law firm that represents whistleblowers and litigates employment-based disputes. 
 
The anti-gag rule prohibits anyone from taking any action to prevent an individual from communicating directly to the SEC staff about a securities law violation, Jason Zuckerman, principal of Zuckerman Law, said in an article in the National Law Review. 
 
&amp;quot;If Apple is using concealment clauses and unlawful NDAs to silence whistleblowers, then Apple shareholders may not have an accurate and complete picture of the company&amp;#39;s financial condition and risks, including Apple&amp;#39;s ESG-related risks and risks stemming from its potential violations of anti-trust laws,&amp;quot; Zuckerman said.

Then there is the ad revenue...if you watch on the Roku OS you can see the free channels and they have ads. Roku are great at targeting ads to the right demographic. Advertisers LOVE this...so pay a good price. 
 
When you think about all of the great streamers such as Peacock, HBO Max, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple, Hulu and others...the same applies. So this will snowball and grow faster and faster. This time when it breaks $500 it will not stop!

For Apple $AAPL Car, a Chargepoint buy makes more sense than Peloton 
  
Wed Feb 09 15:10:14 2022 EDT 
Appleâs biggest challenge putting a vehicle on the road may not be the design, probably isnât the artificial intelligence, and might not be the software and manufacturing â but almost certainly is the most mundane challenge of all: the lack of charging points. 
Apple Cars need chargepoints, too 
In the US, Appleâs home turf and still its most important market, the  US Department of Energy  tells us there are just 111,000 public charging stations for electronic vehicles (EV), which is what the Apple Car is expected to be. </td>

It is impossible to trade within the fight between buyers and sellers, much better the Blue Boxes. #elliottwave #trading </td>

Since then $AMD is second fiddle to no chip maker and trades around $130. People laughed at the analysts that were bullish on $AMD back then. 
 
$F right now is second fiddle to $TSLA and is trading at a really cheap multiple. I expect that in about the same time frame that $AMD went from $10 to $130 (3 years +/-) that $F will be trading at least $90 plus. This is obviously my opinion, but it is an opinion shared by many. </td>

Take into account small caps broke down all year long in 2021 and large caps and big tech have had the spotlight this whole time. What happens when interest rates rise and this large caps canât keep beating record breaking earnings? Not to mention the supply chain issue and inflation. Donât believe me?

ð¥VIRGIN GALACTIC WILL BE THE NEXT TESLAð¥

Just a few short years ago, Tesla jumped from just $40 a share to what would be over $4500 a share before the split price and is $900 a share after the spilt. Many people said they couldnât and would be successful but look at them now.

This is the same case with Virgin Galactic. They are the first to Commercial Space Flight, Space Exploration, Supersonic High Speed Travel and more.

You can bet once Space Flights resume sometime around June or July, this stock would had already been in the $40âs-$60âs. Once Commercial Space Flights start you can expect this to be in the $100âs and you will never see anything under $100 again.

BUY, HOLD AND MAKE MORE MONEY HERE THAN YOUâVE EVER HAD IN YOUR LIFETIME!!! </td>
