The Russian correspondent calls them "nationalists." Other reports on the channel call them "neo-Nazis," "fascists," or "drug addicts" who use civilians as "human shields."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Almost all reports of the conflict are from the breakaway Donbas region in Ukraine's east, specifically the two self-proclaimed "people's republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk, primarily Russian-speaking entities that Russia recognized as independent statelets on February 21.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , That was the trigger for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing Moscow the pretext to invade, claiming it had no choice but to "protect" them from imminent attack by Ukraine, an allegation Ukraine strongly denies. As one news report put it: "De-nazification was possible only with a military operation."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , On Russian broadcasts, the war in the rest of Ukraine, the war most people around the world are witnessing, is largely ignored -- the wreckage of Mariupol left in the wake of Russian bombing; the charred skeletons of houses and buildings in Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson, Zhytomyr and other towns decimated by Russian airstrikes; residential neighborhoods in the capital Kyiv, along with their shellshocked, bleeding residents fleeing Russian shelling -- almost none of this is shown on Russian TV. When it is, it's blamed of course on Ukrainian forces. There is also no accurate coverage of the recent military setbacks suffered by the Russian military. , The reports are emotional, often filled with angry accusations and threats. On one of Russia's most popular talk shows the host, Vladimir Solovyov, rails against Europe and the United States, at one point taunting American media reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin, allegedly, is not being informed by his aides about what really is happening in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "You don't know yet what answers we are preparing for you, you don't know where this is going, and you really won't like it, our American comrades!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Putin, too, has been using more raw, emotional language in his TV appearances as he meets with his Security Council in Zoom-like virtual discussions, or in person, with a member of his cabinet seated at the opposite end of a ludicrously long table, to avoid any possibility of being infected with Covid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The West has one goal, he said in one address: "the destruction of Russia."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "But any people, and especially the Russian people," he assured his viewers, "will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out, like a gnat that happed to fly into their mouths."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , In the closed world of Russian propaganda, however, high emotion can't always make up for a lack of logical consistency. Putin claims that Ukraine isn't really a country but rather an historical part of Russia. Ukrainians and Russians, as he described it in a rambling treatise he published last summer, are one people. And yet, in the war that he himself ordered, Russians are killing their "brotherly" Ukrainians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Sprinkled throughout the news bulletins are short video clips meant to drum up support for the attack on Ukraine:  eager young people running into a formation that, from above, spells the letter "Z," the unofficial symbol of Russia's offensive against Ukraine, painted on almost every tank and armored personal carrier in the war zone -- and occasionally, back in Russia, spray painted on the doors of Russians who express any opposition to the invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In another "rally round the flag" video featuring short quotes from people who look like ordinary Russians, one man says "I support our president!" Another proclaims: "I fully support the policies of our president to protect our people!" Still another says darkly "We don't want NATO to come near us." The last speaker implores: "Let's come together!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In an Orwellian touch, the conflict in Ukraine can be called only a "special military operation." Under a law passed on March 4, it's illegal to call the war a "war," or to describe it as an "attack" or "invasion." Violators can be punished with up to 15 years in prison, as can news organizations that disseminate anything deemed "fake news" about the "operation" or the Russian military.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , There is simply no contrary view of the war to be seen or heard in Russia's mass media. Street protests against the war that broke out across Russia in the first weeks of the fighting, in which more than 15,000 people were detained or arrested, are never shown on state TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Information blockade                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Putin government, for years, has been methodically eliminating Russia's free media and, as the war began, the two remaining independent media outlets, TV-Dozhd (TV-Rain) and Echo Moscow Radio, shut down after the new "Don't say war" law was passed. All broadcast media now is controlled by the government, either directly or through Kremlin-friendly owners and most Russians, with the notable exception of young people, get their news and information from TV.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Online sources of information, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other foreign social media platforms have been blocked. So are international media outlets that broadcast in the Russian language, like the BBC and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , This information blockade appears to be having some success in convincing Russians that their president's war is justified. Subjected to a firehose of propaganda with lies that Nazis rule Ukraine, that Russian compatriots in the Donbas are the victims of "genocide," that Russia itself is in mortal danger of attack from NATO, it may be understandable that many Russians support the war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , A March poll by Levada Center, an independent pollster, suggested in fact that Putin's ratings had gone up since the beginning of the war, with 83% of respondents saying they approved of the Russian President, up from 69% in January. But it's clear that polling is not necessarily reliable in a country where people are subject to a stream of propaganda, and dissent is not tolerated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Ukrainians will suffer for years to come from the destruction unleashed by this unnecessary war. But Russians, too, will suffer the effects of this vicious information war waged by their own government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , </td>

The government has not restrained Japanese companies from continuing to operate in Russia, however the longer the war continues, the harder it will be to keep conducting business there, he said. </td>

It bottles oil  for brands and retailers own label label products.                                                  , "From a UK consumer perspective, sunflower oil is the biggest oil.

So while sunflower oil is impossible to get at the moment, rapeseed oil is possible but difficult to get as well obviously because everyone's having the same idea, as prices are skyrocketing at the moment.", Rapeseed is used far more in the food supply chain, according to the National Edible Oil Distributors' Association.                                                                                                                                                             , British farmers grow rapeseed but there won't be enough to go round.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Prices for rapeseed oil have risen 50-70% since the attack," said NEODA's President Gary Lewis. "But there's a limited supply to cover all this demand so some shortfall will be expected."                                                                                    , Mr Locke's crisp business had to pay through the nose because otherwise he would have run out of crisps, which makes up more than two thirds of his sales.                                                                                                                      , He says he'll absorb the costs as much as he can, but if the situation carries on he'll have to increase prices.                                                                                                                                                                , One immediate headache he and other food manufacturers don't have to worry about is labelling. They're being allowed to switch ingredients without having to print new packaging, which can take up to 12 weeks.                                                                , For grocery expert, Ged Futter, the food industry is now grappling with supply issues not experienced since the end of the Second World War.                                                                                                                                    , "Retailers and suppliers have to work much more closely than they ever have before and to be much more flexible in their approach to make sure the products are on the shelf," he said.                                                                                         , "The immediate focus is sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, but there will be many more products which will be affected over the coming months. It's some of the ingredients you don't even think about, like starch, which comes from wheat."                                      , He believes thousands of products will have to be reformulated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Mr Futter runs a business advising suppliers on how to deal with retailers. He says the ripple effects from the war are creating "scarily high" price rises, adding to already rising prices on the supermarket shelves.                                                        , "I think the level of food inflation we are now going to be seeing will be in excess of 15%'"                                                                                                                                                                                   , On the hunt for a serial killer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The life of the late singer in his own words                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sri Lanka is facing an economic crisis. Here's what it's like for people on the ground - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN)For three straight nights last week, Upul took to the streets of Sri Lanka's capital city holding a candle or a placard as he protested the country's worst economic crisis in decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Like his neighbors, he was frustrated by the more than 10-hour power cuts that plunged Colombo into darkness, and a shortage of gas to cook with that made it hard for his family to eat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Then on Thursday -- the fourth night -- the protest turned violent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Furious demonstrators hurled bricks and started fires outside Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's private residence, as police used tear gas and water cannons to break up the protests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "People were visibly angry, shouting," said Upul, who asked only to be referred to by his last name for fear of repercussions. "Earlier (in the week) they demanded the President to step down, (on Thursday) they were yelling and calling him names."                                                                                                                                                                             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , For weeks, Sri Lanka has been battling its worst economic crisis since the island nation gained independence in 1948, leaving food, fuel, gas and medicine in short supply, and sending the cost of basic goods skyrocketing.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Shops have been forced to close because they can't run fridges, air conditioners or fans, and soldiers are stationed at gas stations to calm customers, who line-up for hours in the searing heat to fill their tanks.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russia shifting focus to show a victory by early May in eastern Ukraine, US officials say - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Washington, DC (CNN)Russia has revised its Ukraine war strategy to focus on trying to take control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , More than a month into the war, Russian ground forces have been unable to keep control of areas where they have been fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin is under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is the place where he is most likely to be able to quickly do that, officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia's "Victory Day," according to one of the officials.                             , May 9 is a prominent holiday on the Russian calendar, a day the country marks the Nazi surrender in World War II with a huge parade of troops and weaponry across Red Square in front of the Kremlin. The officials say Putin wants to be able to celebrate a victory -- of some kind -- in his war on that day.                                                                                                                                                                    , But other officials note even if there is a Russian celebration, an actual victory may be further off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "Putin will have a victory parade on 9th May regardless the status of the war or peace talks," a European defense official said. "On the other hand: a victory parade with what troops and vehicles?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Still, US and European officials say that any deadlines Moscow may set rhetorically don't change the reality on the ground that Russia appears to be preparing for the prospect of an extended conflict in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A European diplomat said that while the Kremlin is talking optimistically, Putin is preparing for a "Chechnya-style long, drawn-out war, because he, to a certain extent, has nowhere else to go on this."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , There are several reasons behind the May time frame, the officials say. As the winter freeze ends and the ground softens, it will be harder for heavy Russian ground units to maneuver, meaning that it's vital for those forces to get into place as soon as possible, US intelligence assesses.                                                                                                                                                                                   , Russian-backed fighters have also already been in that region for years. In 2014, Russian separatist forces took control of territory within the the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Putin announced he was recognizing two self-declared independent republics in the Donbas region.                                                                                                                                                        , Ukrainian officials have publicly pointed to the date as well. "Ahead of May 9, Putin set the goal of a victory parade for this war," Ukrainian Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that the Ukrainians believe they are facing a "very complex and difficult" situation as Putin tries meet a deadline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "His ultimate goal is, was and will be to take over Ukraine, but he failed. He failed due to a very strong resolve of Ukrainian military and very strong unity of Ukraine and the Western world, and the sanctions that have been imposed by the United States and G7 and the European Union," Yatsenyuk said. "So now, as far as I see, Putin switched to Plan B. My take is that this Plan B has a, kind of, deadline. The deadline is the ninth of May."                         , The US also assesses that Putin is now preparing for the first time to name an overall commander of the war to try to achieve greater Russian successes, two of the US officials said. The US belief is Putin will likely name a general who has been in the south because that is a place where the Russians have succeeded in their objectives.                                                                                                                                   , CNN previously reported there was no theater-wide commander on the ground in or near Ukraine, and units from different Russian military districts operating in different parts of Ukraine appear to be competing for resources rather than coordinating their efforts, according to two US defense officials.                                                                                                                                                                       , One of the signs the Russians are regrouping is that their troops pulling out of fighting areas north and east of Kyiv appear to have moved north, in some cases into Belarus, for resupply. The US believes this will put them in position to move southeast into the Donbas region. One Russian battlefield goal in Donbas would be to cut off Ukraine troops already there so they cannot fall back to defensive positions or link up with other Ukrainian forces, officials say., But a shift in the battlefield to the east on the ground may do little to stop the ongoing Russian air assaults by long-range missiles and aircraft throughout the rest of Ukraine, especially in the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Diesel delivery highlights UK dependence on Russia </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> On Saturday afternoon, a bright red tanker carrying 33,000 tonnes of Russian diesel sailed up the Thames and delivered its cargo in Grays, Essex.                                                                                                                                                      , Its arrival - which doesn't violate sanctions - highlights the UK's dependence on Russia, which supplies nearly a fifth of the country's diesel.                                                                                                                                                       , The UK has pledged to stop importing Russian diesel by the end of the year: until then, the deliveries continue.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Russian-owned or flagged vessels are now banned from UK ports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But the STI Comandante's journey from Primorsk on the Baltic sea does not flout the Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia, because the ship is owned by the US firm Scorpio Tankers and flies the flag of the Marshall Islands, a nation in the Pacific Ocean.                                           , Some shipping lines including the global giants Maersk and MSC have chosen to suspend most deliveries to and from Russia.                                                                                                                                                                              , Others have decided that as long as the trade is still legal and safe, they will continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , It's a controversial choice. “This shipment of diesel, along with the other fossil fuels that have been allowed to enter the UK since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is filling Putin’s coffers and helping to fund the war. It has to stop,” said Emily Armistead, programme director at Greenpeace UK., Greenpeace has set up an automated tracker to monitor movements of tankers leaving Russia, loaded with oil and diesel.                                                                                                                                                                                 , The STI Comandante was chartered by ST Shipping, a subsidiary of the commodity giant Glencore. Glencore doesn't necessarily own the diesel on board, though - it may well have been bought and sold many times while the boat was on the water.                                                        , Phasing out Russian oil will be extremely hard, and diesel will be particularly difficult. Russia supplies 8% of the UK’s oil needs but 18% of its diesel, according to government figures.                                                                                                            , Diesel is essential to a modern economy. Besides fuelling more than a third of UK cars, it powers trucks, buses, some trains, farming and construction equipment, and is used for generating electricity.                                                                                              , The Ukraine crisis has led to a shortage of diesel across Europe, which depends on Russia for about half of its diesel imports.                                                                                                                                                                        , This shortage has been reflected in the prices that drivers pay for diesel at the pump, which have been rising faster than petrol prices.                                                                                                                                                              , The average price of diesel in the UK has risen 18% since the start of February, to 177p a litre, while the average cost of unleaded has risen by 11%, according to RAC Fuel Watch.                                                                                                                    , The faster rise “reflects the fact that the biggest immediate problem at the moment for the end user is diesel,” said Neil Crosby, senior oil analyst at OilX.                                                                                                                                         , Other countries, including the US and Germany, have also seen sharply rising diesel prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Diesel supplies were tight before the crisis began, as demand for oil bounced back after pandemic lockdowns faster than producers could keep up.                                                                                                                                                       , “Stocks of lots of fuels are relatively low, but diesel in particular, in Europe, in the US and in Asia as well. The demand for diesel has been very strong up until the crisis, and that also contributed to that. There’s just an imbalance between supply and demand," said OilX’s Mr Crosby.       , Finding alternative supplies to replace the diesel Britain buys from Russia will be made harder because many other countries around the world are also trying to wean themselves off Russian energy supplies at the same time.                                                                         , There is no suggestion of pumps in the UK imminently running dry.

The company named an “incident commander” and relied on a “Protest Response Playbook” and “Labor Activity Playbook” to ward off “business disruptions,” according to newly released court documents.                                                                                                                                                                              , In the end, there were more executives — including 11 vice presidents — who were alerted about the protest than workers who attended it. Amazon’s chief counsel, describing Mr. Smalls as “not smart, or articulate,” in an email mistakenly sent to more than 1,000 people, recommended making him “the face” of efforts to organize workers. The company fired Mr. Smalls, saying he had violated quarantine rules by attending the walkout.                                                                                           , In dismissing and smearing him, the company relied on the hardball tactics that had driven its dominance of the market. But on Friday, he won the first successful unionization effort at any Amazon warehouse in the United States, one of the most significant labor victories in a generation. The company’s response to his tiny initial protest may haunt it for years to come.                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Smalls and his best friend from the warehouse, Derrick Palmer, had set their sights on unionizing after he was forced out. Along with a growing band of colleagues — and no affiliation with a national labor organization — the two men spent the past 11 months going up against Amazon, whose 1.1 million workers in the United States make it the country’s second-largest private employer.                                                                                                                                     , At the bus stop outside the warehouse, a site on Staten Island known as JFK8, they built bonfires to warm colleagues waiting before dawn to go home. They made TikTok videos to reach workers across the city. Mr. Palmer brought homemade baked ziti to the site; others toted empanadas and West African rice dishes to appeal to immigrant workers. They set up signs saying “Free Weed and Food.”                                                                                                                                    , The union spent $120,000 overall, raised through GoFundMe, according to Mr. Smalls. “We started this with nothing, with two tables, two chairs and a tent,” he recalled. Amazon spent more than $4.3 million just on anti-union consultants nationwide last year, according to federal filings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The unionization vote reflects an era of rising worker power. In recent months, a string of Starbucks stores have voted to organize as well. But JFK8, with 8,000 workers, is one of Amazon’s signature warehouses, its most important pipeline to its most important market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Amazon has fought unionization for years, considering it a dire threat to its business model. Its ability to speed packages to consumers is built on a vast chain of manual labor that is monitored down to the second. No one knows what will happen if the newly organized workers try to change that model or disrupt operations — or if their union is replicated among the more than 1,000 Amazon fulfillment centers and other facilities across the country.                                                                      , For all their David-versus-Goliath disadvantages, the Staten Island organizers had the cultural moment on their side. They were buoyed by a tightened labor market, a reckoning over what employers owe their workers and a National Labor Relations Board emboldened under President Biden, which made a key decision in their favor. The homegrown, low-budget push by their independent Amazon Labor Union outperformed traditional labor organizers who failed at unionizing Amazon from the outside, most recently in Bessemer, Ala., “I think it’s going to shake up the labor movement and flip the orthodoxy on its head,” said Justine Medina, a box packer and union organizer at JFK8 who had waited with an exuberant crowd in Brooklyn to hear the vote results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The future of American unionizing efforts “can’t be about people coming in from the outside with an organizing plan that people have to follow,” said Sara Nelson, head of the flight attendants’ union, in an interview. “It has to come from within the workplace.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Now, both the nascent JFK8 union and Amazon face pressing questions. The union, with no traditional infrastructure, experience or leadership, is likely to face a legal battle over the vote and challenging contract negotiations. The company, which did not respond to a request for comment for this article, will have to decide whether to reconsider some of its tactics and address the underlying labor dissatisfaction that handed it such a sweeping defeat.                                                                  , “Amazon wanted to make me the face of the whole unionizing efforts against them,” Mr. Smalls wrote in a tweet on Friday, appearing undaunted by the task ahead. “Welp there you go!”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , When Amazon opened the sprawling JFK8 site in 2018, the company was both drawn to and wary of New York, America’s most important consumer market. The established Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union announced a bold goal: to turn JFK8 into the first organized Amazon warehouse in the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Soon Amazon withdrew from its highly touted plan to open a second headquarters in the city, as a backlash grew over public subsidies it would receive and its history of opposing unions. But the talk of organizing JFK8 went nowhere. In labor circles, many believed that Amazon’s turnover was too high, and its tactics too combative, for a union to succeed.                                                                                                                                                                      , When the first coronavirus cases were confirmed at JFK8 in March 2020, Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls confronted managers with safety concerns. Employees were increasingly worried about rising infection rates and felt that Amazon was not notifying them about cases in a timely manner, managers documented in newly released court records.                                                                                                                                                                                             , But Amazon refused to pause operations, saying it had taken “extreme measures” to keep workers safe. The pandemic had turned JFK8 into a lifeline for the city, where 24/7 shifts and a fleet of trucks delivered supplies as it went into lockdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , As Amazon moved to fire Mr. Smalls that March, two human resource employees at JFK8 doubted the wisdom of his dismissal. “Come on,” one messaged. Mr. Smalls was outside, peaceful and social-distancing, she wrote. His firing, she predicted, would be “perceived as retaliation.” But the termination proceeded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , After the firing, the chief counsel’s smear against Mr. Smalls — a full apology came only later — and the dismissal of another protester, the two friends resolved to take action. Mr. Smalls was outspoken, Mr. Palmer deliberate. They were both Black men from New Jersey and the same age (31 then, 33 now). Both had dropped out of community college, prided themselves on high scores on Amazon’s performance metrics and once hoped to rise within the company.                                                                  , Now they made new plans. Mr. Palmer would keep working at JFK8, the better to change it from inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , In early 2021, they took a road trip to another Amazon warehouse. When workers held a union drive in Bessemer, Ala., Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls wanted to witness it. But they found organizers from the retail union — the one that had previously declared an interest in JFK8 — less than welcoming to them and thought the professionals seemed like outsiders who had descended on the community.                                                                                                                                    , By April, workers in Bessemer had rejected the union by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls declared their intention to organize JFK8, but few took them seriously. Why should they win when better-funded, more experienced operatives had been beaten?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , As they set about their first task — gathering thousands of worker signatures to trigger a unionization vote — cracks in Amazon’s employment model were evident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , JFK8 had offered jobs to workers laid off by other industries during the pandemic. But a New York Times investigation last June revealed that the warehouse was burning through employees, firing others because of communication and technology errors and mistakenly depriving workers of benefits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Black associates at JFK8 were almost 50 percent more likely to be fired than their white peers, according to an internal document. Even before the pandemic upended work, Amazon warehouses had an astonishing turnover rate of 150 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , As Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls approached workers at the bus stop, Amazon’s tone toward its employees kept shifting. Jeff Bezos, the company’s founder, was handing over the role of chief executive to Andy Jassy, and the company raised wages and added the goal of being “Earth’s best employer” to its guiding principles. It pledged to listen to complaints and improve working conditions.                                                                                                                                         , At other times, it was contentious. In a widely publicized Twitter exchange about the Bessemer organizing, Amazon sounded so dismissive about workers who could not take bathroom breaks and had to urinate in bottles that it had to apologize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In May at JFK8, an anti-union consultant called the mostly Black labor organizers “thugs,” according to a complaint filed against Amazon by the N.L.R.B. The retailer denied the episode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , And in November, the labor agency said Amazon had showed “flagrant disregard” for the law and threw out the results of the Bessemer warehouse vote, ordering another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , That fall, after months of gathering support, the New York union organizers delivered more than 2,000 signatures to the labor board, but they were rejected for not meeting the minimum required to hold an election. Mr. Smalls said Amazon had submitted payroll data to the board indicating that the company believed half the people who had signed cards no longer worked at the warehouse.                                                                                                                                        , “After all those months of hard work, it seemed like the momentum was gone,” Mr. Palmer recalled in an interview. Between working his shifts and organizing at JFK8 on his time off, he had spent barely a day away from the warehouse for months. Some of the employees he approached were skeptical of unions or dues, or just grateful for Amazon’s health care and pay, which starts above $18 an hour at JFK8. Others seemed too exhausted and wary to even engage.                                                                 , To press onward, the union leaders posted the TikTok videos, made outdoor s’mores and sang along to hip-hop and Marvin Gaye. When workers faced family crises, the budding union prayed. One fired employee became homeless, and the group set up a fund-raising campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Their near-constant presence at the warehouse helped. “The more comfortable they get with us, that’s when they start opening up to us,” Mr. Palmer said of other workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Some union sympathizers took jobs at JFK8 specifically to help the organizing effort, according to Ms. Medina, who was among them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Amazon countered with the full force of its anti-union apparatus. It monitored organizers’ social media, court filings show, pelted workers with text messages and blanketed the warehouse with signs saying “Vote NO” or claiming the union leaders were outsiders. The company often held more than 20 mandatory meetings with workers a day, The Times reported last month, in which managers and consultants cast doubt on the effort.                                                                                               , “The Amazon Labor Union has never negotiated a contract,” one presentation said. Dues would be expensive, it continued, and the union “has no experience managing this massive amount of money.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Andro Perez, 35, works at a smaller Amazon warehouse near JFK8, where another union vote is scheduled this month. He’s leaning toward voting yes, he said, because Amazon’s mandatory meetings mostly criticized unions. He would rather his employer address the question: “What could you do better?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The organizers at JFK8 fought back, filing dozens of complaints with the N.L.R.B. claiming that Amazon violated workers’ rights to organize. Amazon has denied their allegations, but the labor board found many to be credible and pursued them in administrative court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , By Christmas, the organizers scored a major legal win. Amazon agreed to a nationwide settlement, among the largest in the agency’s history, that said workers could stay in the buildings to organize when they were off the clock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , With that, the organizers moved their potlucks indoors, giving them more access and legitimacy. Mr. Smalls’s aunt provided home-cooked soul food: macaroni and cheese, candied yams, collard greens and baked chicken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “What you do is you create a community that Amazon never really had for workers,” said Seth Goldstein, a lawyer who represented the organizers free of charge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , One day this February, Mr. Smalls was bringing lunch to the break room when Amazon called the police, saying he had trespassed.

Putin’s inner circle, have been sanctioned and relegated to a financial limbo., But Mr. Putin reminded the world this past week that he has economic weapons of his own that he could use to inflict some pain or fend off attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Through a series of aggressive measures taken by the Russian government and its central bank, the ruble, which had lost nearly half of its value, clawed its way back to near where it was before the invasion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , And then there was the threat to stop the flow of gas from Russia to Europe — which was set off by Mr. Putin’s demand that 48 “unfriendly countries” violate their own sanctions and pay for natural gas in rubles. It sent leaders in the capitals of Germany, Italy and other allied nations scrambling and showcased in the most visible way since the war began how much they need Russian energy to power their economies.                                                    , It was that dependency that caused the United States and Europe to exempt fuel purchases from the stringent sanctions they imposed on Russia at the start of the war. The European Union gets 40 percent of its gas and a quarter of its oil from Russia. A cutoff from one day to the next, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany warned this past week, would plunge “our country and the whole of Europe into a recession.”                                                         , For the time being, it appears that the prospect of an imminent stoppage of gas has been averted. But Mr. Putin’s sudden demand for rubles helped prompt Germany and Austria to prepare their citizens for what might come. They took the first official steps toward rationing, with Berlin starting the “early warning” phase of planning for a natural gas emergency.                                                                                                           , Although President Biden has announced plans to release 180 million barrels of oil from the U.S. reserve supply over the next six months and diverted more liquefied natural gas to Europe, that still would not be enough to replace all of what Russia supplies. Russian oil exports normally represent more than one of every 10 barrels the world consumes.                                                                                                                    , Europe’s ongoing energy purchases send as much as $850 million each day into Russia’s coffers, according to Bruegel, an economics institute in Brussels. That money helps Russia to fund its war efforts and blunts the impact of sanctions. Because of soaring energy prices, gas export revenues from Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, injected $9.3 billion into the country’s economy in March alone, according to an estimate by Oxford Economics, a global advisory firm.  , “The lesson for the West is that the effectiveness of financial sanctions can only go so far absent trade sanctions,” the firm said in a research briefing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mr. Putin’s feints and jabs — at one point this past week he promised to stop and continue gas deliveries in the same statement — have also kept European leaders off-balance as they try to divine his strategy and motivations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The war has prompted democracies to move away from relying on Russian exports. They’ve proposed cutting natural gas deliveries by two-thirds before next winter and to end them altogether by 2027. Those goals may be overly ambitious, experts say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In any case, the transition to other suppliers and eventually to more renewable energy sources will be expensive and painful. On the whole, Europeans may be poorer and colder at least for a few years because of spiraling prices and dampened economic activity caused by energy shortages.                                                                                                                                                                                     , And unlike in Russia, governments in these countries have to answer to voters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Putin has already demonstrated he’s willing to sacrifice civilians — his and Ukrainians — to score a win,” said Meg Jacobs, a historian at Princeton University. For European democracies, turning down thermostats, reducing speed limits and driving less is a choice, she said. “It only works with mass cooperation.”                                                                                                                                                         , But leverage, like gas, is a limited resource. And Mr. Putin’s willingness to use it now means that he will have less of it in the future. It will not be an easy transition for Russia either. Most analysts believe that Europe’s aggressive moves to reduce its reliance on Russian energy will have far-reaching consequences, however.                                                                                                                                        , “They are done with Russian gas,” David L. Goldwyn, who served as a State Department special envoy on energy in the Obama administration, said of Europe. “I think even if this war would end, and even if you had a new government in Russia, I think there’s no going back.”                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said as much when she announced the new energy plan last month: “We simply cannot rely on a supplier who explicitly threatens us.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Security concerns aren’t the only development that has undermined Russia’s standing as a long-term energy supplier. What seemed surprising to economists, lawyers and policymakers about Mr. Putin’s demand to be paid in rubles was that it would have violated sacrosanct negotiated contracts and revealed Russia’s willingness to be an unreliable business partner.                                                                                                           , As he has tried to wield his energy clout externally, Mr. Putin has taken steps to insulate Russia’s economy from the impact of sanctions and to prop up the ruble. Few things can undermine a country as systemically as an abruptly weakened currency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Rising concerns. Russia’s invasion on Ukraine has had a ripple effect across the globe, adding to the stock market’s woes. The conflict has already caused​​ dizzying spikes in energy prices and is causing Europe to raise its military spending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The cost of energy. Oil prices already were the highest since 2014, and they have continued to rise since the invasion.  Russia is the third-largest producer of oil, so more price increases are inevitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Gas supplies. Europe gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and it is likely to be walloped with higher heating bills. Natural gas reserves are running low, and European leaders worry that Moscow could cut flows in response to the region’s support of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                , Food prices. Russia is the world’s largest supplier of wheat; together, it and Ukraine account for nearly a quarter of total global exports. Countries like Egypt, which relies heavily on Russian wheat imports, are already looking for alternative suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Shortages of essential metals. The price of palladium, used in automotive exhaust systems and mobile phones, has been soaring amid fears that Russia, the world’s largest exporter of the metal, could be cut off from global markets. The price of nickel, another key Russian export, has also been rising.                                                                                                                                                                      , Financial turmoil. Global banks are bracing for the effects of sanctions intended to restrict Russia’s access to foreign capital and limit its ability to process payments in dollars, euros and other currencies crucial for trade. Banks are also on alert for retaliatory cyberattacks by Russia.                                                                                                                                                                               , When the allies froze the assets of the Russian central bank and sent the ruble into a downward spiral, the bank increased the interest rate to 20 percent, while the government mandated that companies convert 80 percent of the dollars, euros and other foreign currencies they earn into rubles to increase demand and drive up the price.                                                                                                                                    , That has revived the value of the ruble, but as several analysts have pointed out, the currency’s newfound stability has come not because the marketplace suddenly found faith in the Russian economy but because of the extraordinary government interventions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Mr. Putin’s demand that gas purchases be paid in rubles looked like another one of those interventions. Still, the insistence was puzzling. Russia could just as easily take the ongoing influx of euros and dollars paid by foreign governments and convert them to rubles.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Mr. Putin, of course, may revel in putting European governments in an uncomfortable position or flexing his power, but his demands may also reflect difficulties at home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , For example, he may not be able to ensure compliance with his mandate that companies, including the natural gas producer Gazprom, repatriate 80 percent of the dollars and euros they earn and sell them to Russian banks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The problem is that “the government cannot enforce this rule,” said Michael S. Bernstam, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. The “companies are cheating.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “The only people the Russian government can trust is Western companies buying Russian natural gas and other commodities,” he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Aside from currency woes, Russia is struggling economically in other ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The country is already facing a deep recession, and several analysts estimate that the economy could shrink by as much as 20 percent this year. An S&amp;P Global survey of purchasing managers at Russian manufacturing companies showed severe declines in production, employment and new orders in March, as well as sharp price increases.                                                                                                                                         , In a matter of weeks, Mr. Putin undercut business and trade ties between Russia and more wealthy economies that took decades to build after the demise of the Soviet Union. By one estimate, some 500 foreign companies have pulled up stakes in Russia, scaled back operations and investment, or pledged to do so.                                                                                                                                                               , “Russia does not have the capabilities to replicate domestically the technology that it would otherwise have gained from overseas,” according to an analysis by Capital Economics, a research group based in London. That is not a good sign for increasing productivity, which even before the war, was only 35 to 40 percent of the United States’.                                                                                                                              , The result is that however the war in Ukraine ends, Russia will be more economically isolated than it has been in decades, diminishing whatever leverage it now has over the global economy as well as its own economic prospects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Advertisement </td>

The nearly 70 percent increase was in contrast with major carmakers like General Motors and Toyota, which reported big sales declines on Friday because of shortages of key components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The increase in the first quarter builds on Tesla’s momentum from last year, when it nearly doubled sales, to just short of 1 million cars, and overtook Volvo and Subaru. Tesla has coped better with an industrywide shortage of computer chips because its mastery of software allowed it to substitute chips that were available for ones that are scarce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The first-quarter sales were “a positive step in the right direction for the next step of the Tesla growth,” Daniel Ives and John Katsingris of Wedbush Securities said in a note on Saturday, though they acknowledged that some analysts had expected more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Tesla said Saturday that it was able to achieve the sales increase “despite ongoing supply chain challenges and factory shutdowns.” Tesla has had to suspend production at its operation in Shanghai several times because of lockdowns mandated by the local government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Tesla’s first-quarter sales were almost unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2021, when it delivered 309,000 vehicles. The Tesla Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle accounted for almost all the sales volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Some analysts think Tesla could sell 2 million vehicles in 2022 now that a factory near Berlin has begun producing the Model Y for European customers, challenging the German carmakers that dominate the luxury market. Tesla sells far more electric vehicles than any other carmaker, and battery-powered cars are growing faster than any other category of vehicle. Sales of those cars could increase further as gasoline prices soar and stay high. Tesla’s $1 trillion market valuation is a sign that, as far as Wall Street is concerned, it is on track to dominate the industry., At the same time, the market for electric cars is becoming more crowded as established carmakers belatedly offer more battery-powered models that resonate with buyers, like the Ford Mustang Mach E or Volkswagen ID.4. Traditional automakers could begin to take a greater share of the electric car market if, as some industry executives predict, the semiconductor shortage eases later in the year.                                                                                                                                                                                 , Tesla will disclose profit and revenue figures on April 20, the company said Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Advertisement </td>

The increased use of other currencies, such as China’s renminbi, could lead to a more fragmented international monetary system. , RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The dollar would remain the major global currency even in that landscape, but fragmentation at a smaller level is certainly quite possible," Gopinth said. She noted that some countries have opened negotiations over the currency in which they pay for trade.                                    , FILE PHOTO: Gita Gopinath, Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) speaks during a news conference in Santiago, Chile,  July 23, 2019.    | Reuters                                                                                     , "Countries tend to accumulate reserves in the currencies with which they trade with the rest of the world, and in which they borrow from the rest of the world, so you might see some slow-moving trends towards other currencies playing a bigger role," she said.                                  , Gopinath noted that the dollar’s share of international reserves dropped from 70% to 60% over the past two decades.                                                                                                                                                                                  , KREMLIN DECREE: FOREIGN CURRENCY CAN STILL BUY NATURAL GAS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will also push more entities to consider the adoption of digital currencies, further diluting traditional currency value. China had already explored the possibility of adopting digital currency at its central bank.                                                  , "All of these will get even greater attention following the recent episodes, which draws us to the question of international regulation," said Gopinath. "There is a gap to be filled there."                                                                                                        , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Russia’s invasion also drove up projections of inflation, with analysts revising projections from 10.4% to 12.5%, potentially prolonging what many initially believed would be a temporary inflationary period.  </td>

It’s also the bad decisions that distorted price signals inspire throughout the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Caught between the risks of either a prolonged period of destabilizing inflation or a recession triggered by Federal Reserve efforts to cool off consumer prices, Bianco has a rather cautious outlook on the markets. He says the S&amp;P 500 potentially will fall back to the neighborhood of 4,000 in the near term -- a drop of about 11% from current levels -- before it rebounds back to record highs.

A video showed several of the children crying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The images and video could not be independently verified, but in a statement, the health center said they were real and did not deny that parents with Covid were being separated from their children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The fury and concern of parents over what might become of their children if they fall sick is the latest in a series of crises faced by Shanghai officials, who are in the middle of a staggered lockdown to facilitate mass testing in the city. Things have not gone smoothly. Lockdowns have differed by neighborhood, panic shopping has emptied grocery store shelves and people with life-threatening conditions have posted calls for help online when they could not get to the hospital., The entire process has also been opaque. Residents complain they have had little warning about neighborhood lockdowns, which have been repeatedly extended in some districts. Domestic news reports of an outbreak at an elderly care center disappeared from the internet on Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In Shanghai, anyone who tests positive for the coronavirus, whether or not their symptoms are severe, must isolate in a hospital or designated facility. The practice has worried parents, who fear that their children will be separated from them if they are forced to isolate.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , One woman who said her 2-year-old daughter was locked inside the Jinshan clinical center called the situation “totally inhumane” in a telephone interview. The woman, Lucy Zhu, a 39-year-old mother and Shanghai native, visited Shanghai Tongren hospital with her daughter after feeling unwell last week. Shortly after she tested positive for the coronavirus and began her isolation at the hospital, she was separated from her daughter.                                                , Then on Tuesday, her daughter was transferred to the center in Jinshan, and Ms. Zhu was told she could not accompany her. From then until Saturday morning, she had not been able to establish direct contact with her daughter. Although officials said her daughter was fine, they offered her no proof.                                                                                                                                                                                       , “The doctor sent me a video at noon today,” Ms. Zhu said on Saturday. “In the whole room, there was only one nurse, but I saw around 10 minors.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In a statement, the health center said that the children were in the process of being moved to a new, expanded pediatric center and that the center was not a child isolation center, as had been claimed online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ms. Zhu said the statement failed to address the main problem. “Is whether it is a child isolation facility the crux?” she asked angrily. “Could they treat children like this if it is not a child isolation point? What’s the point of clarifying the rumor like this?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Having seen the plight of toddlers being separated from parents spreading on Chinese social media, Irene Yang took things into her hands and phoned the center on Friday. During the call, which she recorded and later posted on Weibo, Ms. Yang, a 28-year-old mother, almost burst into tears, worrying the same situation might happen to her as the coronavirus continues to ravage Shanghai.                                                                                               , A woman who answered Ms. Yang’s call told her that there could be a “time lag” when children were being transferred before parents could see them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , With a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter at home, Ms. Yang said she could not “rest assured and let them go to any place alone, whether it is for medical treatment or isolation, no matter what the situation is.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “For us, it is fine if we can be with our children even if they are infected, but you can’t take the children away by themselves. This is all inappropriate and unreasonable, whether they are 10 years old, 5 years old, or 3 years old or 1 year old. Otherwise, why do we have legal guardians in place?”                                                                                                                                                                                     , A woman who picked up the phone at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center on Saturday declined to comment further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , An article in the state-run China Philanthropist described one child being separated from her mother and father after they were sent to separate isolation hospitals. The article quoted the girl’s mother as expressing concern about her daughter after not getting any photos of her or other forms of communication from doctors. The government-affiliated Shanghai Women’s Federation said on Saturday that it was looking into the situation.                                             , Zeng Qun, deputy director of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, acknowledged at a news conference on Saturday that infected adults might have to be separated from their children. He described the issue as “heart wrenching” and something that needs to be “resolved well.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , With designated child welfare workers at the township and neighborhood level already in place, Mr. Zeng said in situations like this, they are required to “respond quickly, and take the physical and mental safety of the children as the first principle, and quickly carry out emergency response and assistance services.”                                                                                                                                                                  , Advertisement </td>

Johnson III, the longtime leader of Fidelity Investments, was the least well known yet arguably the most important.                                                                                                                              , The others were all public figures, but Mr. Johnson, who died last week at the age of 91, was a Boston patrician with a patrician’s aversion to the spotlight. Despite his upper-class background, he is credited with helping to change the way the middle class thought about its money, transforming Americans from savers to investors. That’s why he matters.                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Johnson, widely known as Ned, was 42 when he took over Fidelity, a small mutual fund company his father had run for three decades. The year was 1972: The market was in the doldrums, inflation was on the rise and Fidelity’s assets were in decline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Like other financial executives, Johnson realized that a new investment vehicle recently approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission might offer a way to attract more money. This vehicle was called a money market fund; by investing in ultrasafe bonds, it could generate returns that matched real-world interest rates. At a time when bank interest was regulated — fixed by law at 5.25 percent — these higher-yielding funds were sold as an alternative to savings accounts.                                         , They were not, however, consumer friendly. While it was easy to move money in and out of a bank account, it often took weeks to redeem money market fund shares, requiring onerous paperwork. That was a turnoff to people who were used to having easy access to their money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , As his obituaries have all noted, Mr. Johnson threw that business model overboard by allowing Fidelity customers to write checks against the company’s money market fund. In one stroke, he made it as easy to take money out of a fund as to put money in. His thinking was that people would be more willing to entrust their money to Fidelity if they knew they could easily withdraw it. He would treat investors like consumers.                                                                                                , If you’re as old as I am, you’ll remember what happened next. Inflation surged and interest rates followed. The average 30-year mortgage rate peaked at close to 17 percent by 1981. Tens of millions of Americans, seeing their savings eroded by inflation, made the leap from a bank account to a money market fund. This was the first step in their transition from savers to investors.                                                                                                                                         , By the fall of 1982, the Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker had brought the inflation rate down sharply, triggering a powerful bull market. Mr. Johnson was ready for the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Fidelity had long before cut its ties with brokers, giving the company a direct relationship with customers. As their money market fund returns diminished, they looked for other vehicles that could provide the yields they had become accustomed to. What Mr. Johnson could offer them was Fidelity’s Magellan fund — or, more specifically, the genius of its manager, Peter Lynch, whom he had installed five years earlier.                                                                                                     , It’s hard to overstate how important Mr. Lynch was in bringing the middle class to the stock market. It wasn’t just that his record was off the charts — the Magellan Fund recorded a 29 percent average annual return in the 13 years he ran it, between 1977 and 1990, with nary a down year. It was also that Mr. Lynch did it while making stock-picking seem like something anyone could do if they just used common sense. He demystified the market for millions.                                                              , Mr. Lynch, now 78, famously invested in Hanes because he saw his wife buying the company’s L’eggs pantyhose at the supermarket. He called his big winners “ten-baggers.” He used to say, “I like to buy a business that any fool can run because eventually one will.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Mr. Lynch’s popularity begot the era of the superstar fund manager, who became heroes for the new breed of middle-class investors. The Magellan fund’s assets under management grew from $18 million to $14 billion during Mr. Lynch’s tenure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , There was another factor pushing people into the stock market around that time, and Mr. Lynch and Mr. Johnson seized the opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In 1982, Congress created the Individual Retirement Account, or I.R.A., which allowed people to defer taxes on $2,000 a year if they put it aside for retirement. By 1984, Fidelity’s marketers were traveling the country, talking up I.R.A.s as a great middle-class tax break — and mutual funds as the way to make the most of it. Fidelity by then offered a variety of funds; Mr. Johnson was also among the first to make it easy for customers to switch from one fund to another, further enhancing the firm’s appeal.       , The mutual fund era ended, more or less, on Aug. 9, 1995. That was the date of Netscape’s blockbuster I.P.O. — its stock more than doubled on its first day as a public company — and the beginning of the dot-com boom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The next few years proved that Mr. Johnson’s goal of bringing the middle class into the market had succeeded. Partly, people had to: How else could they afford to retire or send their kids to college? For better or worse, they embraced those ever-rising tech stocks in the same way they had once embraced Mr. Lynch and the Magellan fund.                                                                                                                                                                                     , I was living in a small town in Massachusetts at the time, and I’ll never forget my neighbors — people I’d never thought of as investors — crowing about the returns they were getting on stocks like Cisco or Juniper Networks or, yes, eToys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Fidelity had a discount brokerage by then but, more important, it had switched the emphasis of its mutual fund business from individuals to corporations offering 401(k) plans to their employees. There are those who believe that employees were better off when companies offered defined benefit pension plans (I’m one of them) but, when confronted with an array of mutual funds to choose from for self-directed retirement plans, people took it in stride. It was no big deal anymore. Americans had truly become investors., Mr. Johnson retired as chairman of Fidelity in 2014, turning it over to his daughter Abigail. Today, it holds over $4 trillion in assets and has more than 30 million customers. But Mr. Johnson’s real legacy isn’t just that he turned a small firm in Boston into a financial behemoth, but how he did it — by making investing a part of everyday middle-class life.                                                                                                                                                              , What do you think?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fracking 'worth exploring' says British Gas owner Centrica </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fracking could boost UK energy supplies and reduce bills, according to Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica.                                                                                       , The UK government placed a moratorium on fracking in 2019, amid fierce local opposition and fears of earthquakes.                                                                                                         , Mr O'Shea said there needed to be an "informed debate" about it.                                                                                                                                                          , However, environmental group Greenpeace said there had been "a decade of hype and bluster" around shale gas.                                                                                                              , Fracking is the process of drilling into the earth, then directing a high pressure mixture of chemicals into layers of rock to release shale gas.                                                                         , "We do have to be careful, if it does cause earthquakes, it's not something we should do," Mr O'Shea said.                                                                                                                , The UK met 48% of its gas demand from domestic supplies in 2020, and bought the rest on international markets, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.                                  , Mr O'Shea told BBC Radio 5Live's Big Green Money show: "The key question is, do we want to source our gas from overseas? Or do we want to have more gas domestically? And shale is certainly worth exploring."            , The UK has only ever had one fracking site in operation, which halted in 2019 following a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA).                                                                                      , The indefinite suspension came after the OGS found was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice.                                                                                 , However, this year regulators gave owners Cuadrilla an extra year to re-evaluate the site before it could be sealed up in 2023.                                                                                           , Mr O'Shea urged informed debate on fracking.                                                                                                                                                                              , "I can't tell you what the right answer is, but I can tell you we don't achieve that by people taking entrenched positions that are not based on the full facts," he said.                                                , He added that British Gas and Centrica had held off discontinuing a share in a fracking licence while it waits to see if the government will revive the possibility of shale gas extraction.                              , "We have a small residual share in a fracking licence which we were in the process of discontinuing," he said.                                                                                                            , "What we've decided to do is just hold off for a year."                                                                                                                                                                   , In March, the Energy Minister Greg Hands said in Parliament that shale gas "could be part of our future energy mix," but added that it would need the "support of local communities."                                     , Mr Hands also said the government was clear that the gas was "not the solution to near-term issues," adding that it would take years before commercial quantities could be produced.                                      , A group of Tory MPs known as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group has been pushing for the government to end its fracking ban saying that it could help secure energy supplies for Britain.                                        , Many environmental groups have said they were concerned about the potential for fracking to cause earthquakes.                                                                                                            , At Cuadrilla's site in Lancashire, more than 120 small tremors were recorded while it was drilling.                                                                                                                       , Rosie Rogers, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, told the BBC: "After a decade of hype and bluster, all the fracking industry has given us are two holes in a muddy field and some minor earthquakes."                      , Previously, Greenpeace has said that fracking would not improve energy security, because any gas extracted would belong to the gas firm doing the drilling, not to Britain, and it would be sold on international markets., "It will take many years to develop and if it ever gets produced, it will be sold to the highest bidder on the international market, with no impact on our energy bills," a Greenpeace spokesperson said.                 , "If the UK and Europe want to end their dependence on Russian gas, the quickest way to do that is by insulating homes, installing heat pumps and boosting renewables."                                                    , On the hunt for a serial killer                                                                                                                                                                                           , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                                , The life of the late singer in his own words                                                                                                                                                                              , © 2022 BBC.

In a word, grimmer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Just before the pandemic, pessimism abounded among the nation’s almost 18,000 new-car dealers. Threats loomed for the traditional sales model — for more than a century, one of the great generators of localized American prosperity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , There was concern, too, about the inexorable advance of electric cars, with their higher price tags and presumed reduced service needs. Autonomous cars portended a drop in car ownership (and buying) with their promise of expanded ride-hailing and car-sharing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Then the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in March 2020 to deliver a feared final blow. While the year opened with brisk showroom traffic, the bottom fell out, with auto sales diving to an annualized rate of 8.8 million that April, roughly half the normal clip. Dealers were rushing to the exit doors, looking to offload businesses that might suddenly be worth only the price of their underlying real estate, if that.                                                                                                                                                                                           , But the pandemic scrambled the economy in ways big and small, predictable and highly erratic. Jobs vanished, but rebounded fairly quickly. Online retailing advanced at a lightning pace. Supply chains grew messy and inflation just grew. And, for car dealers, the unexpected happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Sales recovered rapidly. And by the time the dealers gathered last month in Las Vegas for the 105th edition of their annual conference, they were ebullient, toasting at cocktail parties and stalking the convention floor. Vendors, with anything a car dealer could need or dream of, were armed with enough promotional tchotchkes to fill several gymnasiums.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , There was much to celebrate. Instead of imploding in the pandemic, profits for carmakers and dealers alike exploded and kept soaring. While some brands reported lower sales, transaction prices rose sharply to make up for lost volume, allowing many makers to notch record profits, sales or both. And, lo and behold, car dealers enjoyed their best year in history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “It’s crazy times right now,” said Bruce Bendell, a founder of the Major World and City World chains, with eight dealerships in the Bronx and Queens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Sheldon Sandler, a Wall Street accountant turned car dealership sales broker, agreed. “Every dealer today is making money hand over fist,” he said. “Dealers are making money with all brands, even second- or third-tier ones.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Sandler is a founder and managing partner at Bel Air Partners, a New Jersey consultancy that specializes in the sale of private dealerships and dealership groups to publicly traded companies. If he had a problem these days, he said, it was finding dealers willing to sell their stores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Swings in the trajectory of the pandemic can still hamper demand: After a strong first two months of the year, sales in the industry tumbled in March as fear of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders kept consumers from dealerships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But automobile sales in America account for close to a trillion dollars in annual economic activity and provide 2.3 million jobs. And the industry’s convention this year, after going virtual in 2021, recalled the good old days, with deal-makers making deals, carmakers outlining future products and plans in private meetings with their franchised dealers, and a staggering array of vendors selling everything from car-washing and tire-changing equipment to giant outdoor display machinery that can hoist cars 25 feet off the ground so they might be seen, revolving endlessly, from great distances., “Dealers are making a lot of money,” said David Rosenberg, president of DSR Motor Group and former owner of Prime Automotive, one of the nation’s largest dealership groups, who today owns seven New England car dealerships. “The average Toyota dealer in the Boston region in the best years made between $2 and $2.2 million. Last year, the average net profit was $6 million.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Though not a lot in absolute terms, stimulus money was crucial, said Steve Greenfield, chief executive of Automotive Ventures, an investment advisory firm in Atlanta. The government aid was “enough psychologically for people to feel like they could still spend through that,” Mr. Greenfield said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “Supply of both new and used cars was so limited that when consumers found a car, they seized upon it, and they were totally price insensitive,” he continued. “The dealers parlayed that into more profit on the back end, with finance and insurance and extras, and, for whatever reason, consumers were so desperate that when they found a car, they would pay anything for it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Still, as I wandered the vast floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center and neighboring hotel suites, there were plenty of concerns. For one thing, with supplies limited and prices rising, customers get angry at dealers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “If I now have 15 to 20 cars in stock per dealership,” Mr. Bendell said, “I normally have 200 to 300. Nowadays when a truck comes in with eight cars, by the time they hit the cement pavement, I’m lucky to have one left.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , His stores have even resorted to brokers. “I’m paying $2,000 over sticker price, as a dealer in the Bronx,” he said. “Then the car gets sold 30 seconds later. So we’re paying over list just to get inventory, yet customers blame the dealers for high prices.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , List price or, as it is technically known, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price is a sore spot for Jim Appleton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “You’ve been selling cars below M.S.R.P. for 40 years,” said Mr. Appleton, a lawyer and president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, a lobbying group. “All of a sudden M.S.R.P. is this glass ceiling that you can’t break. Well, your expenses haven’t changed. You’ve got 20 percent of the product you would ordinarily get and you have the same cost structure.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But, he said, manufacturers are happy to let dealers take the blame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “There’s X amount of profit in the building, and selling of a vehicle and the O.E.M.s, well, nobody knows what they make on the cars that they sell,” Mr. Appleton continued, referring to the original equipment manufacturers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Appleton detects the ever-expanding influence of Wall Street and private equity firms behind many dealer woes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “I step back as a dealer advocate. I am an observer, and Wall Street hates these guys,” he said. “Wall Street hates the millionaire on Main Street, the car dealer. In New Jersey, it’s a $36-billion-a-year industry — 500 rooftops, Main Street businesses. The profits go right back into Main Street causes and Main Street economic development, and Wall Street investors and Silicon Valley investors say: ‘What a shame. You know, we should have a piece of that action. Why don’t we have a piece of that action?’”                                                                                        , One particular cause for concern is the global chip shortage, which is expected to last into 2025, keeping inventories tight. Some attendees expressed concern about the push toward electric vehicles, which require twice as many chips as fossil-fuel-burning autos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , A more optimistic strain of thought on E.V.s was also percolating on the convention floor. Profits from electrics are waiting to be mined, said Buddy Dearman, a Memphis-based managing partner for dealership practice at Dixon Hughes Goodman, an international accounting firm. “I’ve read where 60 percent of customers would plan on taking their E.V.s to their dealership for repair. I think there’s a big opportunity in the service area for E.V.s.”                                                                                                                                                       , Dealers today, Mr. Dearman said, garner only 30 percent of the service market. “People take their cars to Pep Boys, they go to AutoZone,” he said. “And I don’t know that they’ll do that as much with E.V.s. If dealers are ready for that, I think they can capitalize.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Larry Vellequette, a reporter for Automotive News, a trade publication, saw further opportunity in the dealers’ embrace of electric cars and suggested that manufacturers’ infatuation with the Tesla dealer-less sales model may be waning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “They finally figured out that Tesla’s Achilles’ heel is service,” he said. “When there’s a problem, where do I go to fix it? And how bad does it look when the only way I can get my car fixed is to tweet to the C.E.O.?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Another persistent concern among those in attendance was the need to hire and retain good employees. One job in chronic undersupply is service technician. Meredith Collins, a director at the consulting firm Carlisle &amp; Company, said demand for such workers exceeded supply by a ratio approaching 5 to 1. Yet, she said, an obvious solution is at hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Less than 1 percent of service technicians are women,” Ms. Collins said, adding that racial minorities are also significantly underrepresented, but not to the same degree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “For years, it’s been an ignored population, just the assumption of, ‘Oh, women just don’t want to be technicians,’” she said. “So there aren’t any women technicians, and not until recently has there been a lot of attention paid to this fact.” Reflecting current corporate social mores, matters of diversity, inclusion and equity peppered many of the speeches and panels at the convention, even if more than a few dealers were spied rolling their eyes, groaning and yawning.                                                                                                                           , As long as inventories remain tight, the consensus on the show floor seemed to be, dealers will remain in good shape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “Dealers are very apt so, when something happens, we’re first to make changes and manufacturers have realized they couldn’t beat it when they’ve tried to own dealerships themselves,” Mr. Bendell said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Mr. Rosenberg, the longtime New England dealer, struck a note of caution, however. “When Covid hit, a lot of dealers decided that maybe the model needs to change,” he said. “We all started selling cars online, bringing cars to people, doing things that probably we should have been doing for a long time. Now that we sort of have gotten over that and there’s this huge scarcity of products, I see a lot of bad habits developing again.”                                                                                                                                                                  , He pointed to “dealer addendum stickers,” with highly marked-up add-ons, and dealers charging thousands of dollars over list price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “Often, dealers won’t deliver vehicles to someone’s house anymore,” Mr. Rosenberg added. “It’s sort of gone backwards because right now it’s a seller’s market.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Glenn Mercer, a longtime industry analyst with McKinsey &amp; Company before setting up his own research company, takes a more sanguine view. “We can think of the two fundamentally different views of modern automotive new-car retail in the United States,” Mr. Mercer said. “Either the industry’s 125 years old and therefore is ripe for death, or the industry’s 125 years old and that’s because it’s very adaptable. I go for the latter.”                                                                                                                                                                     , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> From an Alabama Coal Mine Strike to an Amazon Warehouse - The New York Times </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The strike at an Alabama coal mine is one of the longest in U.S. history. To make ends meet, some striking miners have picked up work at an Amazon warehouse. It’s the same warehouse where workers are trying to unionize.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Curtis Turner, 69, president of United Mine Workers of America Local 2427, protesting near one of the Warrior Met Coal Mine entrances in Brookwood, Ala.

He is named after his uncle, a Korean War veteran, who was fatally crushed between two rail cars while working at the Pullman train factory near Birmingham.                                                                                                                                                              , Hard dangerous work is a part of Mr. Wright’s extended family history and that of many people living in this industrial and mining belt of north central Alabama. Next to the coal mine where Mr. Wright works, there is a memorial to the miners who were killed in an underground explosion in September 2001. Every year, on the disaster’s anniversary, a bell tolls once for each of the 13 workers who died.                                                  , In agreeing to these dangers, Mr. Wright, 39, says he and his fellow coal miners have come to expect something in return from their employer — respect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , After accepting pay cuts when the coal company emerged from a 2015 bankruptcy, the miners said they expected that their previous wages would be restored to match what other mines paid. The company, Warrior Met Coal, declined to comment for this article. It says on its website that Warrior Met made no such promise and has provided multiple raises in recent years.                                                                                        , On April 1, 2021, Mr. Wright joined about 900 other miners who walked off the job and set up picket lines around the mine’s entrances, demanding that the company raise their wages close to the levels they received before the bankruptcy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Less than 30 miles away from where the mine sits is the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., a building that encompasses 14 football fields and employs more than 6,000 people. The workers there have recently voted for a second time on whether to form a union.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , A previous election last spring ended in a defeat for the union by a wide margin. The most recent results now hinge on a series of disputed ballots that will be reviewed in the coming weeks, but the contest is closer than many anticipated. On Friday, organized labor scored a surprising victory as workers at an Amazon facility on Staten Island voted to unionize.                                                                                         , It is a stark tableau of the American economy: coal miners dug into a contract dispute in a diminished industry and low-wage workers seeking more leverage at a high-tech company whose growth seems limitless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Forming a union is a significant step, but maintaining a strike for 365 days requires a measure of solidarity that seems difficult to muster in a deeply divided society. The miners are a mix of Trump supporters and Biden voters, Black workers from Birmingham and white workers from rural towns near the mine. They have supported one another with food donations and camaraderie during a year on the picket line.                                          , On most days, instead of getting up to start his shift as an operator in the mine’s control room, Mr. Wright heads to the picket line or to a food pantry and loads his pickup truck with donated groceries to bring to the miners and their families.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “Coal mining is like a brotherhood, like the military,” said Curtis Turner, president of Local 2427 of the United Mine Workers of America, which represents the maintenance workers at the mine. “They would do anything for each other.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Still, the efficacy of the strike is not clear. Even as the mine operates at a reduced capacity, Warrior Met Coal is generating strong profits and its stock price has soared 125 percent since the strike began.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Even with the union’s support — the miners are paid $800 by the union every two weeks — many have had to get second jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , A few have taken jobs at Amazon in Bessemer, including Mr. Wright, who works the overnight shift, sorting items to be shipped around the South.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , He knows that coal mining will always pay more because of the danger of the work. But when he encourages his new warehouse colleagues to vote for a union, he makes the case that a union could help new industries like e-commerce start to catch up.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , At the mine, Mr. Wright is paid $84,000 a year, including overtime. If he stays at Amazon working full time, he would be on track to earn about $35,000 annually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The miners view themselves as an inspiration to the Amazon workers, an example of what a union can offer in a fight over wages and working conditions. But as the strike enters its second year, there is no clear end in sight to the dispute. It is now one of the longest coal mine strikes in U.S. history, and it could wind up setting a different kind of example.                                                                                           , The predawn sky turned to pink from black as a handful of miners huddled around a propane heater on the side of the road. Others held signs and talked quietly about the strike, which was entering its 336th day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Just down the road, lights were blaring at the mine’s main entrance, as replacement workers showed up for their shifts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Last year, the picket line was the site of heated altercations. The company accused union members of spitting on replacement workers, threatening a security guard with a baseball bat and smashing their car windows. Larry Spencer, a vice president in the miners’ union, said the replacement workers provoked the violence by swerving their cars into the picket line. A county judge issued an injunction severely limiting the union’s picket line activity., Other accusations have surfaced as well. Last month, Warrior Met said there was an “explosive device attack” that damaged one of its natural gas pipelines. Federal law enforcement said it was investigating. In a statement, Warrior Met said the incident was “related to the ongoing labor dispute.”                                                                                                                                                            , The union says it was not involved in the reported attack and that many of the incidents at the mine entrances were provoked by replacement workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , But the union — most of whose members wear camo T-shirts with the union label — is not shy about the message it sends to anyone crossing the picket line. “We are not a part of them anymore, and they are not a part of us anymore,” Mr. Spencer said.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Such militancy has helped hold the yearlong strike together. Only about 100 people have gone back to work, according to the union, whose secretary, Crystal Davis, keeps track of their names. “They made a promise, and they didn’t honor it,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The miners have long viewed themselves as standing apart from other industries because of the hardships they face 2,300 feet below ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “We are in the dust all the time, in the dark all the time,” said Tommy Turner, who makes about $24 an hour as a motorman driving a supply train through the mine. “If something happens,” he said, there is “only one way out.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , According to the company website Warrior Met Coal Facts, the average yearly income for workers has increased to $97,000 from $75,000 in 2016, making them among the top 10 percent of wage earners in Alabama.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “People who don’t know about the job probably say I make good money,” Mr. Turner said. “But I could walk around at Walmart and get $15 an hour for doing nothing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Mr. Turner, 55, is among multiple generations of Black members of coal unions, which were some of the earliest integrated organizations in the South. The union leaders have cast the strike as a struggle that transcends race and even coal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , They have tried to unite the miners around the notion that they are all being slighted by their employer, the local media and Alabama Republicans, who have been vocal supporters of the coal industry in the face of climate regulation but have not backed the striking miners. It is us versus many of them.                                                                                                                                                     , At a recent evening rally in the dirt parking lot of the union hall, all of the miners who are veterans or have relatives in the military were asked to come forward and hold up their hands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Just about everyone — a white man with a buzz cut, a Black woman in medical scrubs, Mr. Turner, who served during the wars in Iraq — raised their arms toward the setting sun in a silent salute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “The difference between us and the people who are keeping us out here, the people who don’t want to give us a fair contract, is what?” bellowed Cecil E. Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “We are the patriots,” he said, answering his own question for the crowd. “We are the ones that gave them a right to be billionaires.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , After the rally, the miners lined up to pick up their strike checks and boxes of meat, yogurts and cakes from inside the union hall. The food had been “rescued” by a charity before it was thrown out by Walmart and other grocery stores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Antwon McGhee, a 48-year-old miner, said he has come to depend on the groceries and donated diapers for his 2-year-old daughter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “You have to swallow your pride and do what you have to do,” said Mr. McGhee, who was earning $88,000 a year before the strike.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. McGhee found odd jobs, like picking up bodies from hospitals and taking them to a funeral home. He worked briefly at a nonunion auto manufacturing plant where one day he watched a worker urinate on herself because she couldn’t leave the assembly line.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “I feel like this strike is way larger than me,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Andre Mumford remembers how on Saturdays before the bankruptcy, the mine’s parking lot looked like a “car show” because there were so many nice new vehicles. Mr. Mumford would sometimes bring his Corvette before his day off on Sunday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , At the time, he was earning about $31.30 an hour as a motorman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But when a pack of private equity firms including Apollo, Blackstone and KKR invested in the coal company in 2016, the mineworkers were told that they needed to accept concessions in their new contract. Mr. Mumford’s hourly wages were reduced to $22.50, though they came up closer to $25 an hour before the strike.                                                                                                                                          , At the time of the bankruptcy, the cuts made sense, Mr. Mumford said. The mine’s primary product — metallurgical coal that is used to make steel — had declined in price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Today, with demand from China driving up metallurgical coal prices, the miners say they deserve wages similar to those they had before the bankruptcy and what other local mines pay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , They also say managers need to approach workers with more respect — less yelling and looking for reasons to discipline someone. Another sticking point: The company doesn’t allow enough unexcused absences, the miners say, to accommodate for family emergencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “For them to treat us the way they are treating us is just insane,” he said. “I don’t have the words.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , In an email, an Apollo spokeswoman said the miners had been given three pay increases since 2017  and are eligible for $17,000 bonuses. Blackstone said its investment helped save jobs during a troubled time in the coal industry. KKR declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , By 2019, all three companies had sold off their investments in Warrior Met, which is now a publicly traded company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Warrior Met recently reported its most profitable quarter in three years and said it was hiring new workers during the strike.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Mr. Mumford is committed to the cause, but he wonders about how it will end. Before the miners went out on strike, a supervisor predicted that the Warrior Met would break the union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “He told me, ‘Y’all won’t be back.’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Michael Argo, 34, went to work in the mine not long after high school, and he has never thought of doing any other type of work — before he spent a year above ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Mr. Argo said he will see the strike through. But after that, he’s thinking about getting a full-time job at Amazon in Bessemer. His wife just got hired there, and Mr. Argo figures their combined wages at Amazon will eventually be close to what he took home from the mine, about $84,000.                                                                                                                                                                     , “Up until this point, I would never quit on my own,” he said of the mine. “I would have just been stuck with it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , During the strike, though, he has started feeling healthier and more in tune with the world and may not want to give that up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “You just get to see temperature changes, the sun coming up and down,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The year has been an eye-opening experience for Braxton Wright, too. Mr. Wright, who usually votes Republican, has become more open to other political perspectives after seeing how few Republicans have backed the strike. His wife, Haeden, a high school English teacher, has decided to run for local office as a Democrat.                                                                                                                                    , She’s been inspired by the support the union has received from people from all over the world, even from members of the Green Party, who adamantly oppose coal. “Many of the donations have come from other workers,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Three nights a week, Mr. Wright says good night to his family and drives 27 miles to the Bessemer warehouse. He uses his phone to clock into the warehouse and climbs four stories to his workstation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Most of the time, he doesn’t deal with a human boss, only the robots that deliver the roughly 300 items he packs every hour. When his back gets sore from twisting and bending and his productivity drops, a manager will sometimes ask him what’s wrong. But he hasn’t been disciplined for slowing down.                                                                                                                                                          , Mr. Wright started at the warehouse with about 35 other people. He no longer sees many of those workers around the building. He thinks many of them have quit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , At the warehouse, Mr. Wright talks to fellow workers about unions. But he said the Amazon employees, many of them young and from poor areas, have a different attitude about their jobs than coal miners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , He watched some doing managerial tasks but not getting paid extra. “They say they want to be managers someday,” he said. “I tell them that’s fine. But they need to pay you for your time. If you were in a union, they would pay you for your time.”                                                                                                                                                                                                               , An Amazon spokeswoman said: “We don’t think unions are the best answer for our employees. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Wright says it has been hard to predict whether the organizing drive at the Bessemer warehouse, which is being run by the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union, will prevail. He’s not hoping to be there much longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “I am hoping I go back to the coal mine,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Putin is making the same mistakes that doomed Hitler when he invaded the Soviet Union - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin often evokes the Soviet Union's epic defeat of Nazi Germany during World War II to justify his country's invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Yet Putin is committing some of the same blunders that doomed Germany's 1941 invasion of the USSR -- while using "Hitler-like tricks and tactics" to justify his brutality, military historians and scholars say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , This is the savage irony behind Putin's decision to invade Ukraine that's become clear as the war enters its second month: the Russian leader, who portrays himself as a student of history, is floundering because he hasn't paid enough attention to the lessons of the "Great Patriotic War" he reveres.                                                                                                                                                     , "I have been trying to make sense of this for a month, because as terrible as Putin is, you could never say he was illogical," says Peter T. DeSimone, an associate professor of Russian and Eastern European history at Utica University in New York.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "All of this is illogical, and that's the scary thing," he says. "This is not normal for what he's done in the past. This is something that makes no sense on many levels, and not just in regard to World War II."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , There are, of course, significant differences between the current war in Ukraine and the clash between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The Nazi war machine was formidable, agile, and well-trained. The Wehrmacht killed and wounded 150,000 Red Army soldiers in the first week of their invasion in June of 1941. They seized vast swaths of territory, and in one "mega-encirclement" trapped four Soviet armies, capturing 700,000 prisoners of war.                                                                                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , And there is no moral equivalence between Joseph Stalin, the Soviet  dictator, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Stalin was a sociopath (he once reached into a cage and killed a family pet parrot because its chirping annoyed him) who starved millions of Ukrainians to death and routinely murdered political rivals. Zelensky is a democratically elected leader who has rallied Ukrainians and inspired the world with his conspicuous displays of courage and eloquent defense of democracy.                                                                             , But look closer at Putin's struggles in Ukraine and ironic parallels emerge. Military historians say Putin is following Hitler's ill-fated playbook in at least three areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Putin forgot a basic rule of warfare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The tank has long struck dread in enemy troops. When the British introduced the first lumbering tanks during World War I, soldiers fled in terror.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Ukraine, though, has become, according to one recent headline, a "graveyard for Russian tanks." Ukrainian soldiers are using everything from drones to Javelins to destroy tank convoys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But Russian tanks have been stymied for another surprising reason: lack of fuel. The lack of fuel is part of a bigger problem. The once-vaunted Russian army has become bogged down in Ukraine not just because of fierce resistance but by something more prosaic: logistics.                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Putin has struggled to feed, fuel and equip his army. There have been reports of Russian troops looting banks and supermarkets, tanks running out of fuel, and soldiers using substandard forms of military communication -- like smartphones -- that have contributed to what Ukraine says are the deaths of at least seven Russian generals.                                                                                                                  , "The evidence suggests that Putin thought he could win a quick victory with the deployment of special forces and airborne units," says Ian Ona Johnson, a professor of military history at the University of Notre Dame. "So when they were forced to go to a much more traditional war involving essentially most of the Russian army along the Ukrainian border, they weren't prepared for some of the logistics."                                            , Poor logistical planning also played a critical role in Nazi Germany's defeat on the Eastern front, where Hitler expected a quick victory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The German army failed to set up sufficient supply lines for the vast distances and harsh terrain of the Soviet Union. German tanks ran out of fuel. The consequences of this poor logistical planning would prove fatal when the Russian winter hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Hitler didn't equip many of his soldiers with winter clothing because he thought the Soviet army was so inferior. German soldiers were forced to fight in freezing temperatures while still clad in their summer uniforms, with some using newspaper and straw to shield themselves against the cold.                                                                                                                                                           ,  "This proved devastating when a particularly brutal Russian winter set in," Johnson says. "Something like 250,000 German soldiers eventually suffered frostbite injuries or died from the cold that winter because of logistical issues."                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The German army reached its lowest point at the battle of Stalingrad, considered the turning point of World War II. There ill-equipped German soldiers were forced to eat horses, dogs and rats to survive the winter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The scale of the fighting in Ukraine today doesn't approach the Eastern Front, but the lesson from both wars can be summed up in a military maxim attributed to Gen.

And there has historically been more allegiance to Russia in the eastern part of the country.                                                                                                                                                                         , But Putin's indiscriminate brutality against civilians is uniting Ukrainians in a way they've never been brought together before. One commentator called hate a "hidden treasure" in war because it can sustain resistance for generations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Hitler's indiscriminate brutality against Soviet civilians also played a crucial factor in his defeat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Hitler had many potential allies in the Soviet Union. Many Soviets despised and feared Stalin, who routinely murdered political opponents, executed military leaders and persecuted Soviet citizens. He murdered about four million Ukrainians by starving them during one infamous period known as the Holodomor.                                                                                                                                              , That's why some Soviets initially welcomed Hitler as a liberator, and gave some German troops Christmas presents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But Hitler's brutal treatment of civilians quickly stiffened Soviet resistance. German troops looted and starved Russian cities into submission. They rounded up Soviet Jews and other minorities, shooting them or poisoning them in mobile gassing vans. Nazi propaganda taught Germans that Soviets were generically inferior "Mongolized" Slavs who deserved death or enslavement.                                                                          , "The Nazis were not an occupying force; they were an extermination force from the start," says DeSimone, the historian from Utica University.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Stalin was so hated that roughly a million Soviets served in the German army, says Johnson, the Notre Dame historian. Hitler's brutality destroyed any chance he had of picking off Soviet sympathizers and weakening Soviet resistance, Johnson says.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Instead of taking advantage of large numbers of people who might been sympathetic or at least think the Germans were better than the Soviets," he says, "Hitler rapidly alienated all those groups."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , He's using Hitler-like language to justify war                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Last summer, Putin published a lengthy essay entitled "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians" that sought to explain that there was an artificial division between the two countries and that "true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia."                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The language Putin used caused some historians to shudder. They said he echoed some of the same rhetoric Hitler used in "Mein Kampf," the dictator's autobiography and political manifesto. Hitler's book brimmed with distorted history about Germany's lost greatness, global conspiracies that undercut Germany's power, and justifications for conquest of another group of people.                                                                         , "Like the Führer, the president of Russia bemoans the tragedy that has befallen his homeland, an erstwhile empire, and he too wants to turn back the clock," wrote Avi Garfinkel, a reporter for Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, in an article entitled, "How Putin's Ukraine Agenda Evokes Hitler's Mein Kampf."                                                                                                                                                , This may be one of the most disturbing links between Putin and Hitler. Some Putin critics say he is using Nazi language and propaganda techniques to justify the invasion of Ukraine. They compared the "Z" inscribed on Russian tanks to a symbol used by Nazis in concentration camps. Others compared a recent massive war rally Putin led in a Moscow stadium to scenes of a Hitler speech in an infamous Nazi propaganda film called "Triumph of the Will.",                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Some of the strongest reaction to Putin's rhetoric stems from his claim that the Russian army is striving for the "de-Nazification" of Ukraine and seeks to protect people who have been "abused by the genocide of the Kyiv regime."                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Timothy Snyder, a leading authority on Central European history and the Holocaust, says Putin's claim about "de-Nazification" is "grotesque" because he's trying to justify invading a democratic country -- led by a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust -- by claiming he's there to fight Nazis.                                                                                                                                            , Snyder calls Putin's justification a variation of Hitler's Big Lie -- a Nazi propaganda technique that insists that if a political leader repeats a colossal untruth enough, people will eventually believe it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "Adolf Hitler had some public relations advice: Tell a lie so big that people will not believe that you would ever try to deceive them on such a grand scale," Snyder wrote in an essay titled, "Putin's Hitler-like tricks and tactics in Ukraine."                                                                                                                                                                                                            , By telling lies that Ukraine is run by Nazis bent on genocide, Putin is making a mockery of people who survived the Holocaust, says Snyder, author of "On Tyranny."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Yet Putin's embrace of the Big Lie could also backfire. In a country where many citizens' ancestors perished in the Holocaust, invoking such a historical tragedy to justify war may only make some Ukrainians more determined to defend their homeland.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Perhaps that is why some Ukrainians no longer call Putin the Russian president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , They call him "The New Hitler."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , What could be the biggest irony of all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , We know the result of Hitler's invasion. The Soviet Union eventually destroyed the Nazi war machine. The Soviets, more than any country, were responsible for the defeat of Nazi Germany. Hitler committed suicide as Russian troops closed in on his Berlin bunker in 1945.                                                                                                                                                                                    , An estimated 26 million Soviets died during World War II. One was Putin's two-year-old brother, Viktor, who died after the German army lay siege to a Russian city, blocking the delivery of food and water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , We don't know how the war in Ukraine will end. Putin could still prevail. He could split the nation and seize the energy-rich resources of Eastern Ukraine and consolidate his hold on the country's coastline, some say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , And we know that in war no one side has a monopoly on brutality. A far-right group with a history of neo-Nazi leanings has played a crucial role in Ukrainian resistance. Ukrainian soldiers have been accused of shooting Russian prisoners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But if Ukraine somehow preserves its independence and its territory, something may happen that could lead to one of the biggest ironies of all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A Ukrainian victory will be depicted as another Great Patriotic War. Ukrainians will commemorate their country's victory with parades and monuments. And Putin will no longer be hailed as a  shrewd and bold leader who restored Russia's greatness by manipulating chess pieces on a global stage.                                                                                                                                                            , He will be seen as a fool whose hubris and brutality drove him into making the same mistakes as the dictator he professed to despise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Viktor Orban, the EU leader who can't quit Putin, faces a united front in Hungary's election - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Six weeks ago, Hungary's election campaign looked and sounded very different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The stakes were already high. Viktor Orban, the longest-serving national leader in the European Union, was seeking to extend his authoritarian premiership deep into its second decade. His rival, leading a united front of opposition parties, bluntly denounced Orban's crusade against independent institutions and the rule of law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But the political focus was resolutely domestic. When foreign policy took center stage, it was usually raised by Orban to tout his international credentials -- such as on February 1, when he boasted of his political longevity while in Moscow, a few feet from his staunch ally President Vladimir Putin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Now, everything has changed. Putin's invasion of Ukraine later that same month has upended the race, recasting its protagonists and rewriting their pitches. It has left Orban, widely regarded as the EU's most pro-Kremlin leader, walking a political tightrope. And it has shone a spotlight on a years-long entanglement between him and the Russian President, two strongmen whose political journeys bear some notable similarities.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "If you want to analyze the election campaign, you have to draw a line on February 24," said Andrea Virág, director of strategy at the Republikon Institute think tank in Budapest, Hungary's capital. "Since the war started, it's completely different."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The race -- which will culminate in Sunday's election -- is now portrayed by the opposition as a crossroads between Hungary's eastern and western horizons. "We only have one choice: we must choose Europe instead of the east," opposition candidate Péter Marki-Zay, the man carrying the hopes of every Orban critic, told supporters this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Marki-Zay leads a united coalition of every major opposition party -- a last-gasp and fragile effort that symbolizes how dramatically anti-Orban parties have been sidelined in recent votes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , War on Hungary's border has also added urgency to what was already a thorny relationship between its government and the EU. While Orban has supported most of Europe's sanctions against Russia, back home the political pragmatist -- who has maintained relationships with dictators and democrats for years -- has focused his pitch on keeping Hungary out of the conflict, and has dodged numerous opportunities to disavow Putin even as the Russian leader wages war.                                                                                                                                                                 , Now, Orban's political future rests on the success of his most complicated shapeshift yet -- into a self-declared peacekeeper who won't quit Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The Putin critic-turned-admirer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , When Putin, then serving as Russian prime minister, launched his first invasion of a neighboring country in 2008, Orban -- at that time in opposition, following a first term as prime minister that ended in 2002 -- clamored to condemn him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But during his second, 12-year stint in power, Orban has embraced a friendly and reliant relationship with Moscow that has made him an outlier in Europe. In a 2014 speech setting out his intentions to build an "illiberal state" in Hungary, he cited Russia as an example; in their February meeting, as Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian border, Orban spoke glowingly to Putin of their bonds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The relationship between the two strongmen is underpinned by economic reliance but also ideological similarities, according to Péter Krekó, the director of the Budapest-based Political Capital Institute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Orban's Hungary is very far from Putin's Russia -- but Orban mentioned already that Russia is one of his role models," Krekó said. "This anti-Western, ultra-conservative, anti-LGBTQ worldview ... (and) an ideology based on state-sponsored information" is "quite similar" to Putin's early moves as President, he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "Orban is the most pro-Putin prime minister (in the EU) and he did not expect the invasion at all," Krekó said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Meanwhile, as most EU countries have united in their support for Ukraine, Orban's relationship with Kyiv has deteriorated over the years. He has impeded the country's attempts to form closer relations with NATO, and has clashed with successive governments in Kyiv. On Wednesday, his foreign minister accused Ukraine's government of coordinating with Hungary's opposition parties, without citing evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , That dynamic has complicated recent EU efforts to punish Russia for its invasion. While Hungary has ultimately supported most sanctions unveiled so far, Orban has been adamant that measures are not extended to imports of Russian oil and gas. Most of Hungary's oil and natural gas imports come from Russia, and 90% of Hungarian families heat their homes with gas, Orban said during a recent visit to London.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "If the sanctions are extended to energy, a situation will arise in which the Hungarian economy will find itself under unbearable pressure, and meanwhile this will probably not harm the Russians an iota," a spokesperson for the Hungarian government told CNN, setting out Orban's position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In that context, most observers expected Putin's war to harm his ally's political fortunes. The opposition had long criticized Orban's so-called Eastern Opening endeavor, which targets trade with authoritarian governments in Russia, China and Turkey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "Putin is rebuilding the Soviet empire and Orban is just watching it with strategic calm," opposition leader Marki-Zay said at a rally this week, Reuters reported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Instead -- thanks to his repeated claims that his rival would send Hungarian troops into Ukraine -- Orban's slight but significant lead in opinion polls has risen since the invasion.

He made no mention of Putin by name, and declined to cast Russia as the aggressor, instead framing the conflict as one between eastern and western powers, with Hungary "a piece in their game."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "We're helping those in trouble, but at the same time we're not taking a single step that could drag Hungary into trouble," a spokesperson for Orban's government added to CNN. "We can't help anyone while at the same time destroying ourselves -- for example, by getting involved in a war that's not our war, in which we have nothing to gain and everything to lose."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , That equivocation appears to have helped his electoral standing.

"Given the deaths of hundreds and thousands of civilians ... it's hard for me to understand this approach," Duda told the TVN24 news channel.

It prompted comparisons with Russia's Foreign Agent Law, which has been used to crack down on opposition voices and independent media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Meanwhile, university reforms ensured that facilities will now be run by foundations, whose trustees are to be appointed by Orban's government, which critics said would extend the ideological imprint of Orban's party into Hungary's higher education classrooms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , And the EU has frequently taken issue with Hungary over rule of law issues. A 2018 law, passed soon after Orban secured a third consecutive term, created new courts overseen by the justice minister to handle cases concerning "government business," such as tax and elections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , A government spokesperson told CNN that the country's constitution, which was enacted in 2011 during Orban's current stint in power, "stipulates that everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression and that Hungary recognizes and protects the freedom and diversity of the press."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But for many Hungarians resisting the country's illiberal trend, this election represents a desperate final push against governmental interference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "There are parallel realities existing right now in Hungary," said Szabolcs Panyi, an investigative journalist who said he was one of many Hungarian reporters whose phones were monitored by Pegasus spyware. "One half of Hungarian society, [which] is consuming state media, sees Orban as a savior who is protecting Hungary from the western global liberal elite."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Panyi foresees a wider threat. "There's a very viable possibility that this propaganda machine that has been tried and tested in Hungary could be exported to support like-minded right-wing leaders," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Those who consume government-friendly media networks in Hungary now frequently see a "pro-Russian narrative," including suggestions that Ukrainian aggression sparked conflict, which have helped Orban land his anti-interventionist message, Panyi said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "They have an enormous media empire," Krekó added of Orban's government. "There are opposition voices, but they are much more silent. And by default, (Hungarians) bump into the government's messaging."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The electoral process too has been targeted. A law passed in 2011 redrew the lines on the electoral map, in what opposition parties and the media criticized as blatant gerrymandering. A government spokesperson denied that claim, telling CNN it was "unfounded and implies a lack of knowledge about the Hungarian electoral system." Last month, Europe's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE), recommended a full-scale international monitoring operation at the April 3 poll -- a rare move for an EU state -- after assessing claims of "a general deterioration of the conditions for democratic elections." , A political experiment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The far-reaching implications of Orban's rule have led his critics to a last-ditch political gambit. "It took some time, but the opposition saw that their only real chance to have some success is to unite," Virag said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Now, all six significant opposition parties -- from the Greens and Liberals to the previously far-right Jobbik -- have put their substantial ideological differences on hold to unite behind Marki-Zay, a conservative small-town mayor who himself once voted for Orban.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Marki-Zay's campaign initially focused on what he called Orban's "corrupt dictatorship," before Russia's invasion forced a pivot. But Marki-Zay has since capitalized on the Ukrainian crisis too, painting Orban as a budding authoritarian following Putin's model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "European integration, democracy and market economy are highly important values ... and the most important (issue) is to root out corruption," he said at a rally in late March, Reuters reported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Much of his message has relied on Hungarian fatigue with an increasingly powerful government. "What will decide this election is that the majority of people is fed up with the past 12 years," supporter Sandor Laszlo told Reuters at another opposition rally. "Hungary deserves calm and peace at last," a second voter, Maria Cseh, said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But should he pull off victory on Sunday, Marki-Zay will face even greater difficulties in power. "It's not an easy job to keep this coalition together; the six parties are very different," Virag said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Culture wars and a controversial referendum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Marki-Zay's profile has itself posed a challenge to Orban. A Catholic father-of-seven, and mayor of the southern heartland city of Hódmezővásárhely, his victory in opposition primaries neutralized the Prime Minister's preferred line of attack: that his opponents are out-of-touch, Westernized social liberals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , For years, anti-migrant rhetoric and policies were the hallmark of Orban's foreign policy. But following the easing of the European migrant crisis sparked by the Syrian conflict, much of his attention has turned to LGBTQ+ people, a trend replicated in neighboring Poland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , That crusade is "very important" to the current government, Virag said, in order to "convince voters there is a danger to Hungary, but Viktor Orban is here to defend (them)."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , On the same day as the election, a referendum will take place on Orban's controversial law that bans the "teaching of sexual orientation" and gender reassignment to children. The government amended a law late last year that banned referendums being held on the same day as an election, ensuring his right-wing base is motivated to turn out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "We are united and therefore we will also win the referendum with which we will stop at our borders the gender madness sweeping across the Western world," Orban said during his March 15 speech.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The controversial LGBTQ+ education law, passed last year, bears similarities to Russia's law against homosexual "propaganda," which was similarly condemned by the West, and LGBTQ+ activists say its wording conflates them with pedophiles and further isolates them from Hungarian society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "Around the world, governments are mobilizing tired and offensive stereotypes portraying LGBT people as a threat to children to drum up political support," Ryan Thoreson, an LGBT rights researcher for global watchdog Human Rights Watch, told CNN in reference to the vote in Hungary. "Human rights shouldn't be put to a vote."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called the law a "shame" that goes against EU values, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte went as far as saying Hungary "has no place in the EU anymore."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But putting the issue to a referendum alongside a national election vote has been dismissed as a stunt by many observers. "The Hungarian population is not very liberal when it comes to cultural issues," but it doesn't have strong feelings about LGBT+ people, Virag said. "Even before the war it was a minor issue."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Rhetoric around the referendum has been far eclipsed by the parliamentary vote, and it is possible it will not reach the threshold of valid votes from 50% of the electorate required to be deemed valid -- the same fate that befell a similarly controversial 2016 referendum on EU migrant quotas. The LGBTQ+ education law is nonetheless already in force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The results of the referendum, however, are unlikely to deter Orban if he claims the main prize of another four years in office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , A failure by the united opposition front would give further proof of Orban's dominance over Hungarian politics, and if he claims a sizable majority, he would be expected quickly to move to consolidate his position further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "With each election, Hungary is becoming more and more illiberal. The election is becoming more and more unfair," Krekó said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "If the opposition cannot reach a majority, or push Orban into a very tight majority, the next time will be even more difficult."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Marija Stonyte picks up her phone and anxiously dials in a number. After a couple of rings, a woman picks up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "I'm calling to tell you a very important message.

The pressure has forced independent news outlets to pull out or shut down, leaving a void for state media to fill with propaganda and disinformation.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Desperate to break through, people around the world are trying creative ways to connect with Russians.

They're cold calling or messaging strangers in Russia, hoping their personal pleas will disrupt the Kremlin's propaganda -- and potentially even help put an end to the deadly war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , 'Make the most important call of your life'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , When Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, documentary filmmaker Stonyte and her husband Mantas Kazlauskas watched the news from their home in the Lithuanian port city of Klaipeda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Stonyte, 30, grew up in Lithuania after the Baltic state declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.

Days later they stumbled across CallRussia.org, an initiative launched March 8 with the tagline: "Make the most important call of your life."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Co-founded by Lithuania-based creative agency director Paulius Senūta, the initiative aims to cold call 40 million phone numbers across Russia. The team gathered publicly available phone numbers in Russia and created a platform that randomly generates a phone number from the list. A user can opt to call over the phone, Telegram, or WhatsApp, and at the end of the call, a site pop-up asks the user whether they got through, and if so, if the call went well.                                                                                , The idea is based on Senūta's belief that Russian people have the power to end the war if they have access to free information and understand the human suffering in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "There's a lot of support (in Russia) for this (war)," Senūta told CNN last month. "But the funny thing about it is they don't know this war. They don't know, hundreds, thousands of people killed, bombs dropped, children killed, women giving birth in metros -- they know nothing about it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , With the help of psychologists, Senūta's team of about 30 people put together a script to guide the calls. They didn't want to get into a confontation -- instead the goal is to "convey the human tragedy and the fact that they don't know about it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In just one week after the CallRussia launch, thousands of volunteers made 84,000 phone calls, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Stonyte says few people hang up. Instead, most fall into one of two categories -- those who argue back, and those who listen, she said. Stonyte believes many people may not want to respond out of fear the call could be monitored and they could face punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , One call to a museum in Moscow stuck with her, Stonyte said, even though the person who picked up the phone said very little. Her husband -- who speaks some Russian -- helped to translate the words conveying the horror of Putin's war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "I believe that even silence between my husband and that woman was really important," Stonyte said.

"They exist in another reality," he said. "He wants to believe me, but he cannot," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Katsurin's father consumes Russian state media, which has been presenting a very different narrative of how the war is unfolding. On March 2, for instance, when Russian military strikes hit schools and cathedrals in Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, banners on Russian state TV channel RT claimed 40 Ukrainian towns and villages had been liberated.                                                                                                                                                                                         , Even the impacts of Western sanctions -- which are now being felt by ordinary people in Russia -- aren't mentioned in Russian daily news reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , To help others in a similar position, Katsurin started a website called Papa Believe which offers tips on how to talk to friends and family about the war in Ukraine. For those who falsely claim, as Putin has done, that Ukrainian government leaders are "Nazi," he recommends telling them Zelensky is from a Ukrainian-Jewish family. When people claim the invasion is not a war, but a "special operation," he recommends explaining that one country has crossed the border of the other and is shelling and capturing cities.                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In a recording of a subsequent call with his father, published to his site, Katsurin tries to counter his father's ideas -- that Russians in Ukraine are oppressed, that the United States is making Slavic people kill each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , At the start of the call, Katsurin seems hurt. "I'm calling to tell you what's been happening in my life and in my country, things that I see with my own eyes, but you don't believe me." By the end of the call, his father seems swayed. "I sincerely understand your feelings and I'm so worried for you," he tells his son.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But convincing a stranger can be even harder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Henkka, a Finnish man based in Estonia, who asked to only be identified by his first name, set his location on dating app Tinder to St. Petersburg, got tipsy, and went on a mission to tell Russians about the war in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Although Instagram and Facebook have been blocked, dating apps are still accessible. "How To" guides have sprung up on social media platform Reddit, advising people how to use Tinder's passport feature -- which allows users to connect with people in other countries -- to share information about Ukraine with Russians.

Have you heard the news about Ukraine?" Henkka said he was surprised by how many of the people he spoke to knew about the invasion but remained lukewarm about the issue or were simply confused by conflicting accounts in Russian and Western media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "They truly didn't know what to trust," Henkka said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , 'Some changes is going to happen'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Cold calling doesn't always have the desired effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Serge Kharytonau, a Belurusian now based in the US, where he works as a media expert at the International Strategic Action Network for Security, says he has made about 120 calls to Russia since early March as part of the CallRussia initiative -- but so far, he hasn't had the impact he hoped for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Fewer than a handful of the calls he's made have been successful, Kharytonau says. In most cases the respondent becomes aggressive or quickly ends the call. Kharytonau says that what's been most surprising is that Russians he has spoken to don't just reject alternative information -- but deny the fact it exists at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , He says that while Russian people are victims of the propaganda that's imposed upon them, it would be "a great mistake" to think they bear no responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "On one side, they're the victims of the propaganda.

More than 14,763 protesters have been detained in 151 Russian cities since the start of Russia's invasion, according to OVD-Info, an independent human rights protest-monitoring group.                                                                                                                                                           , Stonyte, the Lithuanian cold caller, is more sympathetic to the difficulties for Russians. Her hope is that Russians spread the truth of what is happening in private, and eventually, they might be able to protest against Putin's regime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "At the moment, the problem is that only a relatively small percentage of people are against war," she says.

She tells Stonyte she knows everything but is afraid to act on it because she has a baby. She and her partner are thinking about leaving Russia, she says.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , As they talk, their children can be heard chattering in the background -- and both women are moved to tears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "I really hope you will find a way and you will be safe in this situation," Stonyte tells the woman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "We are both mothers and we understand how important is the safety of our children. When we live with these kinds of governments, it is impossible to be completely safe, to feel safe in your own home.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Amazon workers win battle to form first US union </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A team of Amazon workers has forced the technology giant to recognise a trade union in the US for the first time.                                                                                                                                           , Workers at a New York warehouse voted 55% in favour of joining the Amazon Labor Union.                                                                                                                                                                      , The group is led by former Amazon worker Chris Smalls, who made his name protesting against safety conditions at the retail giant during the pandemic.                                                                                                      , Mr Smalls' victory marks a major defeat for Amazon, which had fiercely fought against unionisation.                                                                                                                                                         , However, in Alabama, where Amazon was facing a separate union drive, the company appeared to have fended off activists in a tight contest in which challenged ballots could yet overturn that result.                                                       , Together, the two elections mark a milestone for activists, who have long decried labour practices at Amazon, the country's second largest employer.                                                                                                        , Mr Smalls emerged from the vote count looking tired but jubilant, and popped open a bottle of champagne he was handed by supporters.                                                                                                                        , "We did whatever it took to connect with these workers," he told the crowd, recounting an against-the-odds campaign that started with "two tables, two chairs and a tent" and relied on an online fundraiser for money.                                     , "I hope that everybody's paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us."                                                                                                                                                                          , In a statement, Amazon said it was disappointed by the loss in New York and that it was evaluating how to proceed. It also accused regulators of improperly influencing the vote.                                                                           , "We believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees," the company said. "We're evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the [National Labor Relations Board]". , Rebecca Givan, professor of labour studies at Rutgers University, said Amazon's defeat by Mr Smalls and his team of worker-organisers was a "really big deal", calling it a "David and Goliath story" that upset the odds.                                  , But she warned he will be facing another tough fight when it comes to contract negotiations.                                                                                                                                                                , "Amazon will do everything it can do undo this success, to break up these workers and to try to stop the momentum that will inevitably come from this victory," she said.                                                                                   , After the vote, Chris Smalls was instantly surrounded by supporters and assembled camera crews.                                                                                                                                                             , He and his team of worker organisers had struck out on their own, creating a brand new, independent labour union to launch their fight against Amazon.                                                                                                      , Their victory was a moment of vindication for the former Amazon worker, whom the company once called "not smart, or articulate" in a leaked strategy memo.                                                                                                  , But, as he told the crowd, it is far bigger than that.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Amazon employs more than one million people in the US and it has extraordinary influence on work practices - even outside its doors.                                                                                                                        , The company has put up a wall of resistance to unions since its inception.                                                                                                                                                                                  , With this win, activists are hoping that wall is about to crumble.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Amazon has already poured resources into fighting the unionising efforts, which it sees as an obstacle to business flexibility and warehouse efficiency.                                                                                                    , Officials have said the company offers competitive pay and benefits and believes it is better to work directly with workers. In meetings about the vote, representatives questioned union leaders' ability to win more in contract negotiations.            , Amazon said it may challenge the results, citing the timing of a decision by the National Labor Relations Board to sue the company last month alleging unfair labour practices in New York.                                                                 , As part of its statement, it shared comments by two of the country's most powerful business lobbies also raising objections, including a letter from the National Retail Federation to congressional leaders that called for an investigation of the matter., Mr Smalls said he was undaunted by the challenges ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The 33-year-old had worked for Amazon for more than four years before the company fired him in 2020, after his coronavirus protest, citing quarantine violations.                                                                                           , He established the Amazon Labor Union last year, calling for higher pay, stronger medical benefits, anti-discrimination policies and better leave among other changes.                                                                                      , The 2,654 to 2,131 victory gives his group the right to negotiate a contract with Amazon for the roughly 8,000 workers at the Staten Island warehouse.                                                                                                      , His team is also behind a second union campaign at a smaller warehouse in the same industrial park, which is scheduled for a vote later this month.                                                                                                         , "There's no doubt in my mind we're going to be successful in that one as well," he said.                                                                                                                                                                    , Organisers said Amazon made critical mistakes ahead of the vote, such as pushing to reverse policies relaxed under Covid, including allowing workers to keep their mobiles with them while working.                                                         , Still they said their win in some ways surprised even them, despite the intense efforts they had made to reach out to workers and make their case ahead of the vote.                                                                                        , "Watching all of this come true is pretty crazy," said Karen Ponce, Amazon worker and secretary of the Amazon Labor Union.                                                                                                                                  , The union drives at Amazon come amid an upswell of labour activism in the US.                                                                                                                                                                               , In recent months, organisers have led successful campaigns at coffee chain Starbucks, media outlets, smaller retailers and others.                                                                                                                          , Analysts say the pandemic galvanised workers worried about their safety.

By resigning, Smith will no longer be able to vote on Oscar-nominated movies and performances each year. His work, however, will still be eligible for future Oscars consideration and nominations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , His statement read in full:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "I have directly responded to the Academy's disciplinary hearing notice, and I will fully accept any and all consequences for my conduct. My actions at the 94th Academy Awards presentation were shocking, painful, and inexcusable. The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home. I betrayed the trust of the Academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film. So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate. Change takes time and I am committed to doing the work to ensure that I never again allow violence to overtake reason.", Friday's statement was by far Smith's most contrite take on the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , He initially apologized to the Academy during his televised acceptance speech for best actor, about forty minutes after the slap. But in that speech, he did not apologize to Rock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Smith publicly apologized to Rock the next day via social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , But he was much more critical of himself on Friday, calling his actions "shocking, painful, and inexcusable."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , CNN's Chloe Melas contributed to this story. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> As Wall Street banks embrace crypto, high-flying start-ups look to lure top finance talent </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Wall Street has been beefing up hiring for digital asset teams. But some employees are walking away from name-brand institutions in search of more risk, and potentially, more reward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. JPMorgan has one of the largest crypto teams, with more than 200 employees working in its Onyx division. The JPM Coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world.                                                                  , Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx by JPMorgan, said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank's brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start-up. But when products are launched, they reach "a scale that a fintech can only dream of."                                                                                                                                                        , "There aren't many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months," Farooq told CNBC. "That sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like JPMorgan Chase. The upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls.", When it comes to hiring, Farooq said it's a mix of current JPMorgan employees and competing for talent with start-ups and bigger tech companies. From first-year analysts to senior management and managing directors, there's a greater interest in making the move to crypto, he said.                                                                                                                                      , Financial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015, according to recent data from LinkedIn. In the first half of 2021, that pace jumped by 40%. Banks on a crypto hiring spree included Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One, Barclays, Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America and BNY Mellon.                                                                                  , The crypto boom on Wall Street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start-up world. Crypto and blockchain companies raised a record $25 billion last year, an eightfold increase from a year earlier, according to CB Insights data.                                                                                                                                                                                 , Farooq said that even with the start-up boom, JPMorgan has seen "limited attrition." Those leaving have been people "wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar."                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , However, JPMorgan did lose one of its highest-profile crypto deputies last year. Christine Moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at Onyx. She has yet to announce her next move.                                                                                                                                                                       , "After over a half-decade laying the foundations for blockchain-based infrastructure across financial markets and cross-border payments, creating new businesses that have already scaled into the $USD billions at J.P. Morgan, I am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the Web3/crypto ecosystem from a new angle," Moy told CNBC in an email.           , Other top crypto executives who left Wall Street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mary Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, left her job as a managing director at BlackRock last year. Her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "It certainly wasn't my primary job," Lader said. "It was kind of a hobby, as it is for so many people on Wall Street, and it definitely wasn't something that at the time I was thinking about, because it was early stages of adoption."                                                                                                                                                                                    , At Uniswap, Lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. She said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "This technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn't feel like a risk at all," Lader said. "I was sad to leave the people I had loved working with for many years. I have tremendous respect for the firm, but it didn't feel like a risk. That's a great thing about where we are in Web3."                                                                                                               , Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs, made a similar career change last year. He joined institutional crypto trading platform Talos and described the risk in a similar way, calling the decision "multidimensional."                                                                                                                                                                        , "Inherently, you're taking a brand risk — Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street," Schmidt said. "You are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional, and I very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there's a generational opportunity here."                                                                                                                             , Cryptocurrency start-ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent. Many are looking beyond top candidates with MBAs, and instead considering those with less conventional resumes.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s 10-year government bond yield rose to 2.432%, again approaching more than a 3-year high of  2.54% hit in March as expectations of more aggressive monetary policy tightening are rising. In the US, a strong jobs report and rising inflation expectations strengthened the case for a 50 bps Fed rate hike in May. Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada is expected to hike interest rates by 50 basis points during the April 13th meeting and by 200-220 basis points further this year. </td>

At the same time, investors closely monitored economic data from the US pointing to a tightening labour market in the context of strong inflationary pressures stemming from the war in Ukraine. On the domestic front, Brazil’s industrial output rebounded by 0.7% over a month earlier in February of 2022, topping market expectations of a 0.3% gain. A separate PMI survey showed Brazil's factory activity growth hit a 6-month high in March, recovering from a contraction in February. </td>

Brent crude closed 0.3% lower at $104 and WTI crude settled down 1% at $99 per barrel, bringing the weekly loss to more than 13%, the biggest weekly fall in two years. Oil prices fell sharply yesterday as US President Biden announced a release of 1 million barrels per day for six months starting in May, the largest release ever from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Losses also came on the back of demand concerns from top consumer China, after it reintroduced lockdown measures to curb a resurgence of Covid-19. </td>

The Dow Jones closed more than 100 points higher while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3%. The latest employment report showed US employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, but the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6% and wages growth accelerated again. Meanwhile, March manufacturing data from ISM came below expectations. A tighter job market and soaring inflation are paving the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points in May. Industrial and technology shares underperformed in afternoon trading, while energy stocks were trading higher. Market moves came after all three major averages posted their worst quarter since March 2020. </td>

"These products are incredibility complicated."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, considers leveraged and inverse ETFs, equity indexed annuities and reverse convertibles as complex products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , It may not be enough to even have a Ph.D. in economics to understand the sophisticated instruments, according to Gorman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "This is classic Warren Buffett. If you don't understand it, you can't invest in it. And, that's what's happening here," he said. "The first line of defense here is the broker-dealer. The broker-dealer is supposed to have policies and procedures in place that say this is how you teach people about this stuff. This is what this stuff is. And in the cases the SEC brought, those weren't being followed.", Main Management CEO Kim Arthur highlights the wide availability of alternative investments on trading platforms as problematic. His firm caters to institutional clients and high net worth individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "We do use complex products, mostly options. And, they're mostly covered call options. So, the big difference with that is you're using that to dampen volatility. Create another stream of income or hedge against larger swings," said Arthur in the same segment.                                                                                                                                               , He believes it's key to have regulators enforce the disclosures in the products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "In the meantime, you just continue to do increased education alongside the regulation," noted Arthur. "You don't need a complex product to go broke day trading on Robinhood."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , If there's a broad federal crackdown, Dave Nadig, CIO and director of research at ETF Trends, warns it could have serious consequences for the industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "[It] could have a pretty chilling effect on the sales of those products and investor portfolios," Nadig said in the same segment.

"The unemployment rate dropped to 3.6% – edging closer to a pre-pandemic level of 3.5%.

The move comes as inflation recently hit its third consecutive 40-year high in February.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Now, as the employment market continues to recover, one economist says it will mean the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "Although mortgage rates have spiked more than half a percentage point over the past two weeks, reducing affordability for many potential first-time homebuyers, the increase in wages will certainly somewhat help offset that hurdle," Mortgage Bankers Association Senior Vice President and Chief Economist Mike Fratantoni said. "And the confidence that many potential homebuyers have in their financial situation also benefits from this historically strong job market. We continue to expect that the Federal Reserve will move rates up expeditiously to counter surging inflation and that this report only adds more urgency to their plans to do so.", If you are looking to take advantage of interest rates before they rise again, you could consider refinancing your mortgage to lower your monthly payment.

This change is also improving the job growth, Fratantoni says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "Only 10% of workers reported teleworking due to the pandemic in March, down from 13% in February and less than half the level from its peak," he said. "As the federal government and others return to work in April, this number should drop sharply, which may well lead to further job changes in retail, professional services, and other sectors that are dependent on in-person work."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The strong jobs gains in March may likely be unstable, as some are based on temporary factors like a mass return-to-work. Fratantoni added that March’s job growth was "well-above what can be sustained for the longer term."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , If you are interested in taking advantage of interest rates today ahead of future rate hikes, consider taking out a personal loan to pay down high-interest debt.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Labor Secretary Marty Walsh ackowledges there is 'work to do' on the jobs front, but argues overall the March employment report was 'strong.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The March jobs report revealed another month of robust hiring, likely solidifying the case for the Federal Reserve to pivot toward a mega-sized interest rate hike as it seeks to cool red-hot inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday that payrolls in March rose by 431,000, slightly missing the 480,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists.

"With wage growth running so high, inflation fears are only heating up. A 50-basis point hike at the next meeting is surely secured. The only question that really remains is how many more half-point moves there will be this year."                             , The Fed voted in March to raise its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range between 0.25% and 0.5%.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures fell on Friday, contributing to a weekly loss of more than 1%, with prices pressured in part by strength in the U.S. dollar and a rise in 10-year Treasury yields in the wake of a sizable rise in March U.S. nonfarm payrolls. Still, Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth management, said it appears that falling commodity prices had a bigger impact on gold Friday, particularly with U.S. benchmark oil prices falling below $100 a barrel.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> People have been warned to brace for another huge rise in energy bills when the next cap takes effect in October.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , This could add another £629 a year to a typical bill, on top of Friday's unprecedented £700-a-year rise, says energy consultancy Cornwall Insight.                                                                                                                                                                                 , The expected rise in bills just as colder weather kicks in has prompted calls for fresh government support to those struggling to pay.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Energy prices have been affected by the Ukraine war and pressure on suppliers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The most up-to-date prediction from Cornwall Insight would, if accurate, push annual energy bills for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity to up to £2,600 from October.                                                                                                                                      , A typical bill is expected to fall back to the current level in summer 2023, although longer-term forecasts are tricky.                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Bill Bullen, the boss of Utilita, warned that elderly people and children were at serious risk over the next winter because of a lack of heating.                                                                                                                                                                                  , "We are going to see an extra £500 or £600 added to bills in October, and frankly the chancellor's going to have to fund that entirely for low-income households," he told the BBC.                                                                                                                                                , "He won't be able to afford to take this problem away for everybody... but for customers who can't respond to that price [increase], that's where the help needs to be targeted."                                                                                                                                                  , The warning comes on top of a huge rise in what energy suppliers can charge customers from Friday. The £693 a year rise in a typical energy bill will affect 18 million households, with 4.5 million customers on prepayment meters facing an even bigger increase of £708 a year.                                                 , At the same time, a host of bill hikes take effect with council tax, water bills and car tax  going up for some on 1 April.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Minimum wage rates are rising which, along with some financial support from the government, is partially softening the blow.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Prices in general are rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, but the sudden increase in the cost of energy is the most significant for individuals.                                                                                                                                                                            , This video can not be played                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , New official figures suggest four in 10 bill-payers have been finding it very, or somewhat, difficult to afford their energy costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                , The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said the country is facing the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s.                                                                                                                                                                                        , It is the largest increase, by far, in the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, since it was introduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The cap, set every six months for England.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> U.S. House passes cannabis legalization measure for the second time - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE Act) by a vote of 220 to 204 mostly along partly lines. It's the second time the legislative body has approved the measure to legalize cannabis on the federal level after a vote in 2020. The measure is expected to meet the same fate as it did two years ago, namely it will not be taken up by the Senate. In both cases, the measure was sponsored by Jerrold Nadler, D., N.Y., who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In the latest ballot, three Republicans voted in favor of it and 217 Democrats, with 202 Republicans opposed to it, along with two Democrats. In terms of major moves from the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D, N.Y., later this month is expected to formally introduce the Cannabis Administration And Opportunity Act to remove cannabis from the federal list of controlled substances.

The inflation rate in the currency bloc rose to 7.5% for March, a new record high, surpassing expectations. Consequently, bets of accelerated monetary tightening by the ECB, lifted banks’ shares driven by Banco Santander (2.6%) and Caixabank (3.2%). Meanwhile, utilities Endesa (-0.8%) and Naturgy (-1.1%) pared their gains from the prior session. On the domestic front, Spain's factory activity growth slowed more than expected in March, as demand conditions weakened due to the uncertainty around the conflict in Ukraine.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The seasonally adjusted manufacturing confidence index in Mexico eased to 52.2 in March of 2022 from a downwardly revised 52.4 in the prior month, the lowest in five months. Respondents were broadly less keen to invest (40.8 vs 44.1 in February), and, to a much lesser extent, sentiment deteriorated regarding the country's future economic situation (54.7 vs 54.9) and the company’s future financial situation (59.5 vs 59.3). On the other hand, opinions about the company’s current financial situation were more optimistic (55.4 vs 54.4), as well as regarding the economic situation of the country in the present (50.3 vs 50.1). </td>

The unemployment rate, which is calculated based on a separate survey, fell to 3.6%, the lowest level since February 2020.                                                                         , Job gains were broad-based, with the biggest increases in leisure and hospitality (112,000), professional and business services (102,000) and retail (49,000).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , THESE STATES ROLLED BACK THEIR GASOLINE TAXES.

It is designed to reflect the costs faced by suppliers and to prevent profiteering.                   , There has been a huge rise this time, owing to the rising cost energy companies pay for gas.

At present it is about six times higher than it was a year ago.                                    , One reason is the surge in demand for energy, as businesses and economies get going again after the lifting of Covid restrictions. There is also the ongoing issue of a shortage of gas storage across Europe., A further rise in the price cap - predicted to push up the typical household energy bill by another £600 a year - is expected in October.                                                                     , This is mainly because of the potential restriction of Russian gas supplies - linked to the war in Ukraine.                                                                                                   , While we get very little gas from Russia in the UK, we are affected by the global price of gas.                                                                                                               , Can people forced to work from home ask employers to contribute to energy bills? - Andrew Green                                                                                                               , There is nothing to stop you asking.

Dave                                                                                                  , The triple-lock, a policy used to set the rise in state pensions, was suspended last year because it followed the average rise in wages and would have meant an increase of 8%.                               , At the time that seemed like a big increase, but inflation is now 6.2%.                                                                                                                                       , Instead of the state pension going up by 8%, it's going up by 3.1% - based on the rate of inflation in September last year, which is a much smaller pay rise for state pensioners.                            , Changes announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the Spring Statement were mostly aimed at working people who pay National Insurance. There has not been any specific new support for pensioners.               , Why have tariffs on 100% renewable electricity gone up? - Karl Oldham                                                                                                                                         , Eco providers are still affected by wholesale prices, which are driving bill rises.                                                                                                                           , These providers try to buy in advance from renewable sources, and invest in schemes for renewable generation.                                                                                                 , But ultimately, at present, they have to source electricity from the National Grid - some of which is generated from gas.                                                                                     , As a result, they are not immune to the situation in the wider market, and prices charged by renewable generators have been going up too.                                                                     , On the hunt for a serial killer                                                                                                                                                                               , What did Putin do before he came to power?                                                                                                                                                                    , The life of the late singer in his own words                                                                                                                                                                  , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 ended 0.3% higher to close the week at 7537.5, rebounding from last session’s decline and posting the fourth consecutive weekly gains. Gains were led by consumer staples and miners. Among the individual stocks, Reckitt Benckiser Group climbed 3.1% after Barclays raised its price target. Other consumer staples including Unilever and Diageo were also among the other top gainers, benefiting from a weaker pound.

The Central Bank of Russia relaxed capital controls further by allowing the transfer of funds abroad for individuals but excluded those from countries that supported sanctions. The banking sector led the gains, carried by VTB gaining 13.6% and Sberbank ending 7.5% higher. Also, state-owned energy giant Gazprom closed 3.7% higher after the natural gas kept flowing to Europe, in spite of the Kremlin pledging to immediately suspend supply if the European countries refuse to pay in roubles for deliveries. Meanwhile, Rusgrain shares plunged 11% after the Kremlin said it could limit agricultural exports to “unfriendly” states. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> All three main US stock indexes pared early gains to dip into negative territory in midday trading on Friday, as investors digested a slew of data releases while looking ahead to tighter monetary policy. The latest employment report showed US employers hired fewer workers than expected in March, but the unemployment rate fell to a new two-year low of 3.6% and wages growth accelerated again. Meanwhile, March manufacturing data from ISM came below expectations. A tighter job market and soaring inflation are paving the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a hefty 50 basis points in May. Industrial and technology shares underperformed in afternoon trading, while energy stocks were trading higher. Market moves came after all three major averages posted their worst quarter since March 2020. </td>

Ms. Psaki could also make regular appearances on other MSNBC shows as well as on NBC News, the people said.                                                                          , The route from the West Wing lectern to a network anchor chair is well worn: George Stephanopoulos, for instance, cut his teeth briefing the press on behalf of President Bill Clinton before he worked his way up to chief anchor of ABC News.                                                                                                                                                                      , But it’s unusual for a White House press secretary to be linked to a news organization before formally leaving their government post. And Ms. Psaki, if she joined MSNBC, would be the network’s second major hire this year from the Biden administration; Vice President Kamala Harris’s former spokeswoman, Symone D. Sanders, is set to host a show for MSNBC and Peacock.                                       , That tension emerged on Friday during Ms. Psaki’s regularly scheduled briefing, where she faced tough questions — including from a potential future colleague — about her possible new job after an Axios report.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , From the outset, Ms. Psaki declined to say if she was in talks with MSNBC, saying she had “nothing to confirm about my length of public service or planned service, or anything about consideration about next plans.”                                                                                                                                                                                               , But Kristen Welker, NBC News’s co-chief White House correspondent, pressed her repeatedly on the matter. “How is it ethical to have these conversations with media outlets while you continue to have a job standing behind that podium?” Ms. Welker asked.                                                                                                                                                          , Ms. Psaki said she had abided by “a range of stringent ethical and legal requirements that are imposed on everybody in this administration” about conversations with future employers. She also told reporters, “I hope that I meet my own bar of treating everybody with fairness and being equitable.”                                                                                                             , The White House said in a statement: “Jen is here and working hard every day on behalf of the president to get you the answers to the questions that you have, and that’s where her focus is.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Though a deal is not yet final and could still fall apart, Ms. Psaki is now talking only with NBCUniversal officials, the two people said. CNN had also been pursuing her, one of them said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Typically the road from the White House to hosting a show is a gradual one: Nicolle Wallace, a communications director to former President George W. Bush, spent years as an on-air analyst before achieving stardom with her two-hour afternoon program on MSNBC. Dana Perino, one of Mr. Bush’s press secretaries, took a similar route at Fox News.                                                               , The path has accelerated in recent years, driven in part by viewer appetite for political news and the expansion of streaming TV platforms, which created dozens of viewing hours that needed to be filled. Sean Spicer, former President Donald J. Trump’s first press secretary, now co-hosts a show on Newsmax; Kayleigh McEnany, Mr. Trump’s last press secretary, is a co-host of an afternoon show on Fox News., It is not a surprise that Ms. Psaki is considering the next act of her career. Shortly after joining the Biden team, she said she would stay in the position for about a year. She served as White House communications director during the Obama administration and was the chief spokeswoman for John Kerry when he was secretary of state.                                                                        , As press secretary, Ms. Psaki revived the daily White House briefing, a tradition that mostly fell by the wayside in the Trump years, and has won praise for her adroit, if sometimes evasive, handling of reporters’ questions.                                                                                                                                                                                     , Her spiky exchanges with the Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy are often shared widely on social media platforms. On TikTok, the phrase “Psaki Bomb” is invoked by liberals who enjoy seeing her rebukes to Mr. Doocy’s queries.                                                                                                                                                                                    , Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Long-term unemployment tumbles in March as job market stays hot </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , The ranks of the long-term unemployed fell again in March, edging closer to prepandemic levels as the job market offers ample opportunity for workers.                                                                                                                                                                               , Long-term unemployment is a period of joblessness that lasts 27 weeks or more (or, at least six months). It's generally a financially precarious period for households in which it's harder to find a job and unemployment benefits are unavailable.                                                                                 , The number of long-term unemployed declined by 274,000 in March, to 1.4 million, according to the Labor Department's monthly jobs report issued Friday.                                                                                                                                                                              , In March 2021, the long-term jobless accounted for 43.2% of all unemployed individuals, a pandemic-era high and just shy of the all-time record 45.5%, which was set in April 2010 in the wake of the Great Recession.                                                                                                               , By March 2022, the share had nearly halved to 23.9% and was approaching its prepandemic level of roughly 19% to 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The improvement comes amid a labor market that has been particularly strong for workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Job openings (an indicator of employer demand for workers) are near record highs and layoffs near record lows as businesses aim to hold onto the workers they have.                                                                                                                                                                  , Annual wage growth is higher than at any point in over 20 years, according to economists at job site Indeed. Employees, enticed by higher pay and ample opportunity, have been quitting their jobs at near-record levels.                                                                                                            , "As the labor market continues to expand and more options are available, that helps workers who are traditionally the last to return to the workforce, which includes workers who are unemployed for long periods of time," according to Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at career site Glassdoor.                                   , More from Personal Finance:These states have the highest and lowest tax burdensHere's how to get relief at the gas pump nowThe Great Resignation is still in full swing                                                                                                                                                              , The long-term unemployed often have a difficult time finding a job, due to factors like lost connections to work networks or frayed on-the-job skills, Zhao said. Employers also tend to prefer candidates without long gaps in employment history.                                                                                  , "But employers are competing fiercely for talent right now," Zhao said. "They're willing to overlook some of these concerns."                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The March jobs report painted a rosy picture of overall employment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The U.S. unemployment rate edged down to 3.6% in March from 3.8% the prior month, almost hitting its 3.5% level in February 2020 — which, in turn, was the lowest unemployment rate since December 1969.                                                                                                                             , The U.S. has added 562,000 new jobs per month in 2022, on average. That's almost exactly the same pace as average monthly job creation in 2021, according to Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and former chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration.                      , If the pace continues, the economy will recover all its lost pandemic-era jobs (22 million total) in June, Zhao said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "It's remarkable how quickly the economy has recovered given how deep the crisis was," Zhao said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , It's unclear how long the worker-friendly labor market will persist. The Federal Reserve started raising interest rates to cool down the economy and reduce inflation, which is running at its fastest pace in 40 years. The war in Ukraine and any unforeseen Covid-19 curveballs pose potential headwinds to the U.S. economy, too., Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Mexico Factory Activity Remains in Contraction in March </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P Global Mexico Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.2 in March of 2022 from 48.0 in the prior month. The latest reading pointed to the 25th consecutive month of contraction in factory activity amid further declines in production, sales, and employment. On the price front, inputs costs rose at the second-sharpest rate since the series began in 2012 amid persistent supply bottlenecks on the heels of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Firms continued to pass additional cost burdens to clients, with output charges increasing to their highest since August 2018. Manufacturers remained optimistic about future output, but overall confidence dampened. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European stocks ended Friday's session slightly higher, with Germany's DAX up 0.2% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 rising 0.6% led by gains in miners as almost all sectors and major bourses were in positive territory. The latest data showed Eurozone inflation rate climbed to a fresh record high in March, bolstered by soaring oil and gas prices amid sanctions against Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, strengthening the case for the ECB to end 8 years of negative interest rates sooner. Also, Eurozone and Germany’s final PMI readings came lower than preliminary estimates at 14 and 18-month low, respectively. For the week, the German index advanced by about 1% lifted by some progress in talks between Ukraine and Russia. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Colombia Factory Activity Growth Edges up in March </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Davivienda Colombia Manufacturing PMI edged up to 52.1 in March of 2022 from 52 in the previous month. It was above the neutral 50.0 threshold for the ninth straight month, indicating an overall improvement in operating conditions. Output expanded at a stronger rate amid higher sales, strengthening demand conditions and improved client confidence. Similarly, factory orders expanded at the quickest rate in the year-to-date, owing to new bid awards, new client wins, the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and improved demand. However, staff shortages, raw material scarcity and inflationary pressures restricted the expansions in production and sales. Employment rose, reflecting sustained increases in sales. On the price front,Input costs rose sharply again, with companies transferring part of this to consumers via hikes to output charges. Finally, business optimism weakened due to election, inflation and supply-chain concerns. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chicago wheat futures fell below $10 per bushel at the beginning of April, the lowest in one month, on expectations of higher production in Asia and North America. Higher wheat prices amid the war in Ukraine may allow Indian wheat to tap into new markets. Healthy harvests and improved transportation infrastructure in India, the world’s second-largest producer, could lead to record wheat exports in the coming year. Indian exports are expected to reach 7 million tonnes in the 2022 financial year and forecasts for 2023 range up to 21 million tonnes, according to the agricultural division of ITC. Meanwhile, rainfall in dry regions of the US plains and Europe may lead to higher crops in the northern hemisphere. Still, the wheat prices remain 20% above their February levels as the war in Ukraine has disrupted shipping from the Black Sea region, and production in Ukraine is set to decline. Ukraine was the world's sixth-largest exporter of wheat in 2021 with a 10% share of the market. </td>

The Kremlin said contract obligations would be met for fuel due only by the end of April and Gazprom has started notifying its clients about the new rules but EU leaders continue to disagree with Moscow’s position. In Q3 2021, Gazprom, which is Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas, relied on the euro for roughly 59% of foreign sales. Support also came from forecasts of below-average temperatures in northwest Europe, which should add pressure on utilities' inventory replenishing efforts, and reports that unplanned outages at Norwegian gas fields continued to affect output. During Q1 2022, the contract surged more than 56%. On a weekly basis, it’s headed for a 16.5% jump. </td>

A slowdown was seen in new orders (53.8 vs 61.7), production (54.5 vs 58.5) and backlog of orders (60 vs 65) and price pressures intensified (87.1 vs 75.6) due to instability in global energy markets. On the other hand, employment rose at a faster pace (56.3 vs 52.9). "The U.S. manufacturing sector remains in a demand-driven, supply chain-constrained environment. Progress was made to solve the labor shortage problems at all tiers of the supply chain, which will result in improved factory throughput and supplier deliveries. Panel sentiment remained strongly optimistic regarding demand", Timothy Fiore, Chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee said. </td>

Although backlogs of work rose at a sharper pace firms noted that fewer supply bottlenecks allowed production to expand at a faster rate. Moreover, supplier delivery times deteriorated to the smallest extent since January 2021. Nonetheless, costs continued to soar, as the rate of input price inflation quickened to a marked pace. Encouraged by stronger demand conditions, firms stepped up their hiring activity, with some also noting a greater ability to find suitable candidates.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing PMI rose to a fresh all-time high of 58.9 in March of 2022, from 56.6 in February, the 21st month in a row with the reading above the 50 threshold. Output, new orders, and employment rose faster, as good producers faced the strongest demand in a year, amid a combination of the lifting of COVID-19 rules, and concerns over both shortages and further price hikes. Also, the aforementioned issues, coupled with delivery delays prompted good producers to expand pre-production inventories at a record pace. Meanwhile, soaring transportation, metal, and fuel prices, as well as input shortages drove costs at an unprecedented rate, which also reflected in a record-breaking inflation rate for selling charges. Finally, manufacturers were more optimistic because of the further easing of restrictions and expectations of a return to normality. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the French 10-year OAT rose past 1%, hovering around 5-year highs as the worldwide bond selloff continued amid bets of accelerated monetary policy tightening by major central banks. Consumer inflation in the Eurozone came at a record-high 7.5% in March, well above expectations, moving money markets to expect four 25bps rate hikes by the ECB until year-end, according to Bloomberg. To add, unemployment levels remained at all-time lows in the currency bloc. In the meantime, Federal Reserve policymakers expressed support of a 50bps hike in the Funds rate in May, accelerating from expectations since the start of the tightening cycle in March. Investors now await the 1st round of French presidential elections on April 10th, in which centrist incumbent Emanuel Macron leads the polls ahead of right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Goldman Sachs is betting that you’ll want a $10,000 home improvement loan from the investment bank </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Goldman Sachs, the 153-year old investment bank, is now officially in the home improvement loan business as it continues a push into the finances of ordinary Americans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The bank expects to add one million customers a year to its budding Marcus retail division through the acquisition of GreenSky, announced in September at a $2.2 billion price tag, Goldman executives said in their first interview after the deal closed Tuesday. GreenSky is an Atlanta-based buy-now, pay-later fintech firm that focuses on construction loans with an average $10,000 size.                                                   , "It a great acquisition engine because we expect to bring a million new customers annually through this distribution we're adding to the Marcus ecosystem," said Swati Bhatia, a Goldman partner and former Stripe executive. These customers will be able to use the firm's Marcus app, where they will be offered the bank's other products, including savings, personal loans and an expected digital checking account later this year, she said., The move has broad implications for Goldman investors as it ramps up its ambitions in consumer finance, bringing increased opportunities — and risk. Goldman will start originating GreenSky's loans using its own $1.5 trillion balance sheet in the next few months, according to Bhatia, replacing the bank partners GreenSky had leaned on when it was independent.                                                                             , That will add potentially billions of dollars of new loans onto its balance sheet, which should serve as an engine for generating the type of interest income that powers larger retail rivals like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , As a result, Goldman — which typically touts it ability to manage risk as it added products like the Apple Card to its portfolio — will be more exposed to the creditworthiness of ordinary Americans. While GreenSky naturally caters to homeowners, the loans are unsecured, meaning customers' houses aren't used as collateral if the borrower falls behind.                                                                                    , GreenSky had been originating roughly $7 billion in loans a year before it was acquired, although Goldman may choose to securitize some of the loans, depending on market conditions, Bhatia said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Thanks to a shortage of new construction homes and remote-work trends accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, demand for home improvement loans has been robust, according to GreenSky founder David Zalik, who is joining Goldman at the partner level.                                                                                                                                                                                           , "It's amazing how resilient that business is, even with a pandemic, with supply chain challenges, rising interest rates; the demand has been tremendous," Zalik said. "There was two months in the pandemic where we didn't grow, and then it went through the roof. People want to invest in their homes."                                                                                                                                         , Customers typically come to GreenSky through the fintech's network of 10,000 merchants, which range from small businesses to some of the biggest U.S. home improvement brands. Users choose the length of repayment periods that may vary from 36 to 84 months and can repay loans early "at any time," according to Zalik.                                                                                                                         , "The consumer appreciates that if the total project is $15,000, I can buy it for $90 a month at a low single-digit interest rate," Zalik said. "It helps the consumer afford and manage their cash and helps the business sell their product, no different than Toyota sells a lot more cars because financing is available."                                                                                                                       , The integration of GreenSky systems into Goldman will take through the rest of the year and possibly into 2023, Bhatia said. With that, the bank will be closer to its vision as a provider of multiple digital products, both directly to consumers as well as via partners.                                                                                                                                                                       , "Eventually as we complete the integration, we will be able to offer products across the spectrum to all of our customers," Bhatia said. "We are working on creating one seamless digital experience for our customers."                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Got a confidential news tip?

As for this session, market sentiment remained slightly bullish, as traders digested a lower-than-expected PMI reading for the UK’s manufacturing sector in March. Across sectors, losses in pharma stocks partly offset gains in consumer staples, like Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, and financial stocks. Barclays added 0.6% after a London court blocked a multi-billion pound claim filed by thousands of asset managers, pension funds, and other financial institutions against major banks.

Source: Serhiy Haidai, Head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, on Telegram

According to Haidai: &amp;quot;The incident occurred in the zone of active hostilities. Currently, the repair workers have no opportunity to get there. Gas was burning for some time after the strike, but we managed to close all the valves in time.

There is no threat to the population or the environment. However, Sievierodonetsk and nearby towns have been left without gas – about 60,000 households.

A total of 36 towns and villages (131,944 households) are without gas, 30 of them have lost supply completely, and 6 partially.&amp;quot;

The health agency was notified that tinnitus, a hearing problem that causes ear ringing, may be associated with the vaccines.

Gregory Poland, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, says he developed tinnitus after receiving his second dose of the vaccine.

In an interview with MedPage Today, he recounts nearly veering out of his lane driving back from the hospital after receiving his second dose.

“It was like someone suddenly blew a dog whistle in my ear,” Poland told the medical journal. “It has been pretty much unrelenting.”

Poland has been experiencing what he describes as life-altering tinnitus.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Major cities across China have been placed under lockdown as the latest outbreak of Covid rages through the population. Since then, experts have warned of potentially devastating impacts on various supply chains, especially with manufacturing hubs like Shenzhen being brought to a standstill. Aside from creating a potential shortage of iPhones and vehicles, the lockdown has also brought to light the critical supply of precious metals and minerals that China provides.

According to a report by the EU Commission, China produces 98-99 percent of all the &amp;quot;rare Earth elements&amp;quot; in the world.

These are a collection of 17 rare metallic elements that are used in heavy industry and high-tech uses, especially in the developed world.

Given China&amp;#39;s dominance in the supply of such minerals, Jason Kaplan founder and Director of Commodities Analysis and Insight Ltd, warned that Xi could use this monopoly to influence political pressure on countries like the UK and the EU.

However, it provided no further details or explanation.

Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told Reuters: &amp;quot;I think this means Gazprom is drawing a curtain on being an active participant in the European gas market. Essentially it is going home because it no longer feels welcome.

&amp;quot;I think Gazprom understands it is going to face a hostile political and regulatory environment in Europe and therefore wants to consolidate and conduct all of its business in one place - St Petersburg, most likely with the political support of the Russian government.&amp;quot;

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Mexico, which has been subsidizing gasoline to soften price spikes, said on Saturday the policy would not apply in the U.S. border region this week, citing shortages as more Americans drive south to fill their tanks. 
 
The suspension of the subsidy from April 2-8 covers cities in the border states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora and Baja California, including Tijuana, one of the world&amp;#39;s busiest border crossings. 
 
Mexico&amp;#39;s finance ministry said in a statement there was a gasoline shortage in the area &amp;quot;from an imbalance between supply and demand.&amp;quot; 
 
&amp;quot;In the United States, gasoline prices are higher than in Mexico, and citizens of that country cross the border to stock up,&amp;quot; the finance ministry said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Last month, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: $AAPL) CEO Tim Cook wrote an email to his employees asking them to return to their offices beginning April 11. 
 
The full hybrid pilot program would involve employees coming into the office on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday and work â€œflexiblyâ€ on Wednesday and Friday. 
 
However, it looks like some employees are not happy with Apple&amp;#39;s policy of returning to the office. 
 
Some are saying that they plan to quit in protest because they â€œdon&amp;#39;t want to deal with the commuteâ€ or â€œsit around for eight hours a day,â€ the New York Post reported.  
 
Several employees expressed their frustration about the new office policy more crudely. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t give a single f*** about ever coming back to work here,&amp;quot; an employee wrote on the anonymous corporate message board Blind this week. 
 
â€œIâ€™m going to go in to say hello and meet everyone since I havenâ€™t since I started and then sending in my resignation when I get home,â€ another employee wrote.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Mortgage delinquencies are on the rise. Indeed, in February, the national delinquency rate rose for the first time in 9 months, largely driven by a 97,000 rise in early-stage delinquencies — or those that were 30 – 60 days past due, according to new data based on month-end mortgage performance statistics from Black Knight, a mortgage and real estate data and analytics company.  
 
The number of properties that are 30 or more days past due or in foreclosure reached approximately 1.95 million nationwide, while total U.S. foreclosure starts hit 25,000, up 541% from the same time last year, Black Knight revealed. 
 
Why are we seeing this uptick?  
 
“Homeowners who were struggling financially got a free pass on their mortgage payments for a year or longer. Now though, homeowners have to resume payments and some can’t,” says Jeff Ostrowski, analyst at Bankrate.

The Joint Forces Operation (JFO) of Ukraine&amp;#39;s military said fighting in the southeastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk continued Saturday. 
 
In a press statement, the JFO said six Russian attacks in the region had been successfully thwarted and Ukrainian forces destroyed four Russian tanks, six armored combat vehicles and seven motor vehicles. CNN cannot independently verify the claims.  
 
&amp;quot;Ukrainian defenders continue defending our land,&amp;quot; the statement read. 
 
Some context: Ukrainian forces are bracing for intensified fighting in the east of the country, as the Russian military -- facing stiff resistance -- has claimed it is &amp;quot;de-escalating&amp;quot; around Kyiv and shifting focus eastward. US intelligence also suggests Russia has revised its invasion strategy to focus on taking control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine, with a target date of early May. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY  The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called the South Korean defense minister a “scum-like guy” for talking about preemptive strikes on the North, warning Sunday that the South may face “a serious threat.” 
 
Kim Yo Jong’s statement came amid heightened tensions between the rival Koreas over the North’s spate of weapons tests this year, including its first intercontinental ballistic missile launch in more than four years. Some experts say her statement could signal that North Korea will conduct more significant weapons tests soon and take a hardline stance on South Korea. 
 
The ICBM test that broke North Korea’s four-year moratorium on big weapons tests was a huge embarrassment to South Korea’s liberal President Moon Jae-in, who has pushed hard to achieve greater reconciliation between the countries and find a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear crisis.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Russia has revised its Ukraine war strategy to focus on trying to take control of the Donbas and other regions in eastern Ukraine with a target date of early May, according to several US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence assessments. 
 
 Putin is under pressure to demonstrate he can show a victory, and eastern Ukraine is the place where he is most likely to be able to quickly do that, officials say. US intelligence intercepts suggest Putin is focused on May 9, Russia&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Victory Day,&amp;quot; according to one of the officials. 
 
May 9 is a prominent holiday on the Russian calendar, a day the country marks the Nazi surrender in World War II with a huge parade of troops and weaponry across Red Square in front of the Kremlin. The officials say Putin wants to be able to celebrate a victory -- of some kind -- in his war on that day.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Mr. Putin reminded the world this past week that he has economic weapons of his own that he could use to inflict some pain or fend off attacks. 
 
The ruble, which had lost nearly half of its value, clawed its way back to near where it was before the invasion. 
 
And then there was the threat to stop the flow of gas from Russia to Europe â€” which was set off by Mr. Putinâ€™s demand that 48 â€œunfriendly countriesâ€ violate their own sanctions and pay for natural gas in rubles. It sent leaders in the capitals of Germany, Italy and other allied nations scrambling and showcased in the most visible way since the war began how much they need Russian energy to power their economies. 
 
The European Union gets 40 percent of its gas and a quarter of its oil from Russia. A cutoff from one day to the next, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany warned this past week, would plunge â€œour country and the whole of Europe into a recession.â€

Are we on the verge of a crack-up boom?

Bloomberg News recently solicited advice from Argentinians who lived through that country’s high inflation on how Americans should cope with rising inflation. The Argentinians suggested Americans spend their paychecks as fast as possible to avoid future price increases. They also suggested taking out loans that can be paid back later in devalued currency.

Homeless. Jobless. School less.

Don&amp;#39;t be any part of that bloodlust, EU, there are other ways than supporting criminal leader for oil.

Like you imposed on Greece in 2014, for their bankrupt country, restricting spending, austerity measures, and hey, it worked, Greece became relevant again.

This new star they discovered on 3/31 name means: 

&amp;quot;Morning star&amp;quot;.  

Could that be just a coincidence versus the scripture below?  Given everything that has been going on these last couple of years, I highly doubt it.

Believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins today my friends.  He loves you, and can&amp;#39;t wait for you to do so.

He&amp;#39;s coming back.  ⭐✝️⭐

&amp;quot;Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place—until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts.&amp;quot; (2 Peter 1:19) </td>

It’s 3/2020, a zombie virus is approaching, 4/2020 panic sets in and we really don’t know whether anything is going to be normal again.  In a month, the market started to rip, we were above precovid prices in a blink of an eye WHILE unemployment was skyrocketing and we weren’t producing anything.

It’s 4/2022, our labor market might be the strongest on record as far as job openings:unemployed ratio, companies are literally stuffed to the brim with cash, Europe and China seems to be slowing down global growth which will ease inflation for the US as we are humming like business as usual, and THIS is when the analysts and economists want to come out screaming a recession is imminent?!  🤦‍♂️ 

Things are getting more expensive, ok, they will continue to.  The inverted yield curve is a blind monkey forecast—it’s more indicative that the fed moved WAY too slow.

The full hybrid pilot program would involve employees coming into the office on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday and work â€œflexiblyâ€ on Wednesday and Friday. 
 
However, it looks like some employees are not happy with Apple&amp;#39;s policy of returning to the office. 
 
Some are saying that they plan to quit in protest because they â€œdon&amp;#39;t want to deal with the commuteâ€ or â€œsit around for eight hours a day,â€ the New York Post reported.  
 
Several employees expressed their frustration about the new office policy more crudely. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t give a single f*** about ever coming back to work here,&amp;quot; an employee wrote on the anonymous corporate message board Blind this week. 
 
â€œIâ€™m going to go in to say hello and meet everyone since I havenâ€™t since I started and then sending in my resignation when I get home,â€ another employee wrote.

&amp;#39;Apple employees will be required to go in on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, while Wednesdays and Fridays will be “flexible.” Employees will also be allowed to work fully remotely for up to four weeks per year.  
 
By comparison, Google is also requiring many employees to come in three days per week starting this coming Monday — but unlike Apple, Google is giving some employees the option of switching offices or working fully remotely forever. 
 
The offer includes the caveat that employees could take pay cuts if they leave the San Francisco Bay Area or New York City for less expensive parts of the country. 
 
Meta is also letting employees apply to work from anywhere, although “Metamates” who move may also face pay cuts. And Amazon originally planned to push employees back into the office three days per week but later reversed that policy, leaving the decision up to individual teams. &amp;#39;

Someone play it through for me.  Why has Putin not done it yet? Is it coming ? And if it does, what will Zelensky do ?  Would he not order the evacuation and surrender the city ? Would he dare risk millions of lives that Putin is bluffing? Finally, what would NATO do under such an ultimatum ? </td>

My thoughts as we begin the week.... 

Last week I spent positioning short the mkt to begin the week as I felt the 460/462 level on the SPY was probably near a top. As I mentioned to members early on, the mkt would need a technical reset. My ultimate target as we headed into the end of the week was 448/449 (we hit 449). On Friday, I sent an email alert out mentioning I was covering my SPY short because it had fulfilled the target pullback. But also because the mkt is in limbo at those levels just above 450. And while the uptrend is still intact,  the underlying issues with our mkt are glaring. 

This week&amp;#39;s Game Plan discusses how I detect stocks prior to earning season that have potential to outperform. The clues that the charts can give us as well as five other signs I look for to determine whether a stock is poised for a strong qtr/guidance.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $AAPL This is what I&amp;#39;m seeing for Apple right now - 15 minute candle-sticks. Looks there was a solid bounce off of the $172 range on Friday after the major break to the downside on Thursday afternoon. Using the fibonacci retracement tool, you can see that that the point where Apple got rejected on Friday afternoon is not only the 50% retracement point, but is also a point of previous resistance, and right around where the 50 SMA currently is. This leads me to believe that we will see even more heavy resistance at this level during any short-term move to the upside. Not to mention the chart seems to be forming a sizeable head and shoulders right now at the top of the long run Apple has seen over the past few weeks. A break below the $172 range in the near future will confirm the head and shoulders and indicate even more downside potential.👀

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SQQQ , $WEAT, $GLD  One of my hobby subjects is inflation.  The most recent CPI data, showed that many discretionary items started to inflect down, while non-discretionary food, and fuel rose at a faster pace causing over-all inflation to increase to 7.9%.  https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm The American consumer is JUST BEGINNING to buy less of what they want, and more of what they need.  Wages, year over year have increased just 5.3%, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm so I think  non discretionary costs will continue to rise, which might help businesses like COST, while customers cut back spending on the larger number of discretionary businesses like RH , CROX, $AAPL , etc.  As 70% of the American economy is based on consumption, AND because fuel prices are more likely to increase going into the summer driving season, AND food shortages outside of the US, driving up costs here, yes,  I think a recession is damn near inevitable.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A few things to note when we trade $SPY $TSLA $NVDA $AAPL $FB  
 
We must ALWAYS determine the market sentiment and BIAS for that day based on the news and headlines that driving the market. This is incredibly important. 
 
Then, we determine key scenarios in the market that will CONFIRM this for us. Once this is true, we will trade off our SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE LEVELS. 
 
And lastly, we are studying the volume to see if the move is a relevant, an anomaly and supported. The trend is your friend most cases.  
 
#TIP If the $SPY is bullish, we tend to go long, buy calls, ADD ON DIPS and ADD on breakouts to the DAY the $SPY is red and sentiment has changed. On this day, we take a loss. I NEVER try to guess when the market is turning around. On the day the market turns around, I know by taking a few losses then I know right away today is the reversal. </td>

Im incredibly proud of Tesla Team - they pulled it off in spite of all  headwinds from shut down bc of zero China virus ? policy to shut down for production calibration then Chinese new yr  thats over 9 days ( 12k cars ) .. just incredible (321k my estimate) !! 

Ill reiterate - results are only for short sighted analysts - for me I look at the bigger pic growth over 70% YoY while legacy losing 25% YoY !!! 

Follow - theres a lot of money to make on both short n long term - be smart n learn so you can earn !!

More shutdowns due to Covid in Q1.  Much lower seasonal demand for autos in Q1 (which of course affects just about every automaker except for Tesla).  Virtually no production from Austin and Berlin yet.   

And yet add all that up and they still managed sequential growth somehow.  Tesla must be finding new methods of efficiency that have never been thought of before </td>
