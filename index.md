   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australian Shares Rise as Energy, Retailers Lift </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2% to around 7,408 on Monday, helped by gains in energy stocks as oil and coal prices approached recent highs, while retailers supported further after rising from Covid-induced slumps. Advancers among energy firms include Woodside Petroleum (1%), Santos Ltd (0.9%), Beach Energy (1.4%), Whitehaven Coal (4.1%), Washington H Soul (1.7%) and New Hope Corp (3.5%). Meanwhile, retail conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd jumped 2% even after it warned of a lower first-half net profit after tax due to Covid-induced restrictions. Other gainers in the retail sector were Woolworths (1.4%), Endeavour Group (2.4%) and JB Hi-Fi Ltd (2.2%). Elsewhere, heavyweight miners and gold companies fell on weaker iron ore and gold prices. On the virus front, Covid cases dropped in New South Wales and Victoria on Monday, although hospital admissions continued to rise. </td>

A car that was customized almost 70 years ago, within the context of an emerging American art form, is still revered today.”                 , Few cars share the Merc’s pedigree. It was built by many of the most prominent names in the midcentury Southern California custom car scene, including George Barris, who went on to design iconic cars for TV shows such as “The Munsters,” “The Beverly Hillbillies” and “Batman.” It went on to win scores of awards and trophies.                                                                                     , The sellers were Scott and Darla McNiel, son and daughter of Jim McNiel, who bought the car in 1959 for $500, saved it and eventually restored it to its original glory before his death in 2018. The automotive historian Ken Gross and the classic car expert Wayne Carini helped the McNiel siblings broker the sale. The buyer’s name has not been disclosed.                                                         , The McNiels were long-term stewards of the car, and they hoped to maintain their family’s narrative connection to the Merc. “The thing that’s most important to me is that my dad’s impact on the history and legacy of the car stays attached to it,” Scott McNiel said. “And my fear that once it moves away from our family, it becomes just a Barris Kustom and Jim McNiel gets left out of the storytelling process.”, Apparently, this connection will persevere. “Darla kept a $10 bill that her father gave her at an early age,” Mr. Carini said. “Before the car went over the block for sale, Darla and I hid that same $10 in the car, so Jim will always be a piece of the car.”                                                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The annual inflation rate in Qatar inched up to 6.47% in December of 2021 from 6.09% in the previous month. It was the highest rate since December 2008, due to  faster rises in prices of both recreation &amp; culture (37.31% vs 35.25% in November) and clothing &amp; footwear (6.17% vs 2.10%), while housing &amp; utilities prices fell much less (-2.71% vs -4.02%). On the other hand, prices continued to increase for transport (11.28% vs 13.62%), food &amp; beverages (6.73% vs 6.80%), miscellaneous goods &amp; services (2.57% vs 3.07%). On a monthly basis, consumer prices were up 0.65%, the least in three months, easing from a 1.33 percent gain in November. </td>

The series has been at historically elevated levels over the past year, largely driven by government stimulus and record low-interest rates. "While private house approvals are no longer at record highs, the November result remains 25.8 percent higher than the pre-pandemic level in November 2019, indicating ongoing strength in the detached housing market," said Daniel Rossi, ABS Director of Construction Statistics. Approvals rose in Queensland (7.4 percent), South Australia (6.4 percent), and New South Wales (5.4 percent), while falls were recorded in both Western Australia (-12.1 percent) and Victoria (-0.8 percent). </td>

This marked the first rise in building permits since August, driven by an increase in approvals for private sector dwellings excluding houses, which rose 9.7 percent following a 37.9 percent slump in October. Meanwhile, private sector houses continued to level off (1.4 percent vs 3.5 percent) after being at historically elevated levels over the past year due to government stimulus and record low-interest rates. Across Australia, dwelling approvals rose in Tasmania (40.8 percent), Queensland (20 percent), South Australia (14.5 percent), and Victoria (8.9 percent). In contrast, building permits fell in both New South Wales (-18.4 percent) and Western Australia (-1.1 percent). </td>

Machinery orders increased mainly in the manufacturing sector, lifted by the following industries: ceramic, stone &amp; clay products (36.3%), chemical and chemical products (32.1%) and automobiles, parts &amp; accessories (15.4%).

But it’s been virtually impossible for the grower to turn a profit in a struggling legal industry where wholesale prices for cannabis buds have plunged as much as 70% from a year ago, taxes approach 50% in some areas and customers find far better deals in the thriving underground marketplace.                                                  , So the company has two identities — one legal, the other illicit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "We basically subsidize our white market with our black market," said the cultivator, who agreed to speak with The Associated Press only on condition of anonymity to avoid possible prosecution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , In this March 15, 2018 photo, two undercover Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies dump marijuana into an evidence bag during a raid at an illegal marijuana dispensary during a raid in Compton, Calif.

The state requires legal businesses to report what they grow and ship, and it's entered into a vast computerized tracking system — known as "seed to sale" monitoring — that's far from airtight.                                                                                                                                                 , "It's not too hard" to operate outside the tracking system's guardrails, the grower said. Plants can vary widely in what each one produces, allowing for wiggle room in what gets reported, while there is little in the way of on-site inspections to verify record-keeping. The system is so loose, some legal farms move as much as 90% of their product into the illicit market, the grower added.                                                                                                        , In this March 15, 2018 file photo, an undercover Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy loads two evidence bags into a van after raiding an illegal marijuana dispensary in Compton, Calif.

In 2018, when retail outlets could open, California became the world's largest legal marketplace and another steppingstone in what advocates hoped would be a path to federal legalization, after groundbreaking laws in Colorado and Washington state were enacted in 2012.                                                                      , Today, most Americans live in states with at least some access to legal legal marijuana — 18 states have broad legal sales for those 21 and older, similar to alcohol laws, while more than two-thirds of states provide access through medicinal programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Kristi Knoblich Palmer, co-founder of top edibles brand KIVA Confections, lamented that the migration of business into the illegal market was damaging the effort to establish a stable, consumer-friendly marketplace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "To have this system that now appears to be failing, having people go back into the old-school way of doing things ... it does not help us get to our goal of professionalizing cannabis and normalizing cannabis," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In this June 27, 2017, photo, Jerred Kiloh, owner of the Higher Path medical marijuana dispensary, stocks shelves with with cannabis products in Los Angeles.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was lieutenant governor at the time the law was approved, called it a "game changer."                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But California’s legalization push faced challenges from the start. The state’s illegal market had flourished for decades, anchored in the storied "Emerald Triangle" in the northern end of the state. Not since the end of Prohibition in 1933 had an attempt been made to reshape such a vast illegal economy into a legal one.                                                                                                                                                                            , NYC CANNABIS LOUNGE OPENING WILL BE ‘EXTREMELY SOCIAL,’ RESTAURATEUR BEHIND BLT STEAK SAYS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In October, California law enforcement officials announced the destruction of over 1 million illegal plants statewide but said they were finding larger illicit growing operations. In the cannabis heartland of Humboldt County, many illegal growers are moving indoors to avoid detection. Investigators are making arrests and serving search warrants every week, but with so many underground grows "we may never eliminate the illegal cultivation," Sheriff William Honsal said in an email to the AP., California's illegal market is estimated at $8 billion, said Tom Adams, chief executive officer of research firm Global Go Analytics. That's roughly double the amount of legal sales, though some estimates are even larger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In September, a cannabis company sued government regulators in state court in Orange County, alleging so-called burner distributors were using shadowy "front men" to get licenses to buy wholesale cannabis, then selling it in the illegal market to sidestep taxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , No state is claiming to have eliminated illegal operators. U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat who co-chairs the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, said he saw little prospect for undercutting illegal markets without federal legalization, which has been stalled in Congress despite having Democrats in control of Congress and the White House.                                                                                                                                                  , This photo provided by a marijuana cultivator under the condition of anonymity shows trimmed cannabis buds grown in Northern California on Dec. 3, 2021.

Yet it just never feels like we’re being treated like we’re on the right side of history," Knoblich Palmer said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , California's effort to establish itself as the preeminent player in the legal cannabis economy has never felt more imperiled, and talk is spreading of a Boston Tea Party-like rebellion against state policies. In a December letter to Newsom, about two dozen industry executives said the state was crippling the marijuana economy.                                                                                                                                                                      , "The California cannabis system is a nation-wide mockery, a public policy lesson in what not to do," the business leaders wrote. Newsom has signaled he's open to change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , This photo provided by a marijuana cultivator under the condition of anonymity, shows the tops of cannabis plants in Northern California on Nov. 24, 2021.

There is a widespread mindset — "Why bother?" — when the illegal economy is booming and there is little law enforcement to fear.                                                                                                                                                                                           , In Los Angeles, for example, opening a retail operation can cost $1 million or more with licensing fees, real estate costs, attorneys and inspections — if you can get a license at all. Promises of social equity programs that would assist businesses run by people of color who were targeted during the war on drugs have gotten off to an uneven start.                                                                                                                                                 , For the struggling legal market, "when you have quality, price and convenience working against you, that’s a challenge," said Adams, the cannabis analyst. "The illicit market has all three of them."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , An irony in the legal market is that wholesale prices have plummeted, shaking the supply chain. A year ago, a cultivator could get about $1,000 a pound wholesale. Now that’s dropped as low as $300, with the market saturated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Slap $150 in cultivation taxes on a $300 pound, and that’s a stunning 50% rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Part of the problem for the industry is about two-thirds of California cities do not allow legal sales or growing — local governments control when, or if, to create legal markets, and many have banned it or failed to set up rules. Even in places that do, cities have been slow to permit storefronts to sell legal products, with less than 1,000 brick-and-mortar shops in a state with nearly 40 million people.                                                                                      , This photo provided by a marijuana cultivator under the condition of anonymity shows the tops of cannabis plants in Northern California on Nov. 24, 2021.

The legal market, with limited outlets to sell it, is flooded with pot from corporate-scale growers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Few know the industry as well as dispensary owner Jerred Kiloh, who also heads the United Cannabis Business Association, a Los Angeles-based trade group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "No one is making money anywhere in the (legal) supply chain," he said, noting his own sales have nosedived. Kiloh sees few bright spots in the law that established California's legal market, beyond a testing program that safeguards quality and programs to expunge old criminal records for marijuana.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , With Proposition 64, "we did it all wrong," he said. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The pandemic has made the world's wealthiest richer but led to more people living in poverty, according to the charity Oxfam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Lower incomes for the world's poorest contributed to the death of 21,000 people each day, its report claims.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But the world's 10 richest men have more than doubled their collective fortunes since March 2020, Oxfam said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Oxfam typically releases a report on global inequality at the start of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , That event usually sees thousands of corporate and political leaders, celebrities, campaigners, economists and journalists gather in the Swiss ski resort for panel discussions, drinks parties and schmoozing.                                                                                                                                            , However for the second year running, the meeting (scheduled for this week) will be online-only after the emergence of the Omicron variant derailed plans to return to an in-person event.                                                                                                                                                                  , This week's discussions will include the likely future path of the pandemic, vaccine equity and the energy transition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam GB's chief executive, said the charity timed the report each year to coincide with Davos to attract the attention of economic, business and political elites.                                                                                                                                                                  , "This year, what's happening is off the scale," he said. "There's been a new billionaire created almost every day during this pandemic, meanwhile 99% of the world's population are worse off because of lockdowns, lower international trade, less international tourism, and as a result of that, 160 million more people have been pushed into poverty.", "Something is deeply flawed with our economic system," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , According to Forbes figures cited by the charity, the world's 10 richest men are: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault and family, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Ballmer and Warren Buffet.                                                                                                                 , While collectively their wealth grew from $700bn to $1.5tn, there is significant variation between them, with Mr Musk's fortune growing by more than 1,000%, while Mr Gates' rose by a more modest 30%.                                                                                                                                                    , Oxfam's report is based on data from the Forbes Billionaires List and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth report, which gives the distribution of global wealth going back to 2000.                                                                                                                                                                     , The Forbes survey uses the value of an individual's assets, mainly property and land, minus debts, to determine what he or she "owns".

At least 20 million people, or about 1.5 percent of China’s population, are in lockdown, mostly in the city of Xi’an in western China and in Henan Province in north-central China.                                                                                                                                                                         , The country’s zero-tolerance policy has manufacturers — already on edge from spending the past two years dealing with crippling supply chain woes — worried about another round of shutdowns at Chinese factories and ports. Additional disruptions to the global supply chain would come at a particularly fraught moment for companies, which are struggling with rising prices for raw materials and shipping along with extended delivery times and worker shortages.                                                                                                             , China used lockdowns, contact tracing and quarantines to halt the spread of the coronavirus nearly two years ago after its initial emergence in Wuhan. These tactics have been highly effective, but the extreme transmissibility of the Omicron variant poses the biggest test yet of China’s system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , So far, the effects of the lockdowns on Chinese factory production and deliveries have been limited. Four of China’s largest port cities — Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin and Shenzhen — have imposed narrowly targeted lockdowns to try to control small outbreaks of the Omicron variant. As of this weekend, these cities had not locked down their docks. Still, Volkswagen and Toyota announced last week that they would temporarily suspend operations in Tianjin because of lockdowns.                                                                                             , Analysts warn that many industries could face disruptions in the flow of goods as China tries to stamp out any coronavirus infections ahead of the Winter Olympics, which will be held in Beijing next month. On Saturday, Beijing officials reported the city’s first case of the Omicron variant, prompting the authorities to lock down the infected person’s residential compound and workplace.                                                                                                                                                                                  , If extensive lockdowns become more widespread in China, their effects on supply chains could be felt across the United States. Major new disruptions could depress consumer confidence and exacerbate inflation, which is already at a 40-year high, posing challenges for the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “Will the Chinese be able to control it or not I think is a really important question,” said Craig Allen, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “If they’re going to have to begin closing down port cities, you’re going to have additional supply chain disruptions.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The potential for setbacks comes just as many companies had hoped they were about to see some easing of the bottlenecks that have clogged global supply chains since the pandemic began.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The combination of intermittent shutdowns at factories, ports and warehouses around the world and American consumers’ surging demand for foreign goods has thrown the global delivery system out of whack. Transportation costs have skyrocketed, and ports and warehouses have experienced pileups of products waiting to be shipped or driven elsewhere while other parts of the supply chain are stymied by shortages.                                                                                                                                                             , For the 2021 holiday season, customers largely circumvented those challenges by ordering early. High shipping prices began to ease after the holiday rush, and some analysts speculated that next month’s Lunar New Year, when many Chinese factories will idle, might be a moment for ports, warehouses and trucking companies to catch up on moving backlogged orders and allow global supply chains to return to normal.                                                                                                                                                           , But the spread of the Omicron variant is foiling hopes for a fast recovery, highlighting not only how much America depends on Chinese goods, but also how fragile the supply chain remains within the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , American trucking companies and warehouses, already short of workers, are losing more of their employees to sickness and quarantines. Weather disruptions are leading to empty shelves in American supermarkets. Delivery times for products shipped from Chinese factories to the West Coast of the United States are as long as ever — stretching to a record high of 113 days in early January, according to Flexport, a logistics firm. That was up from fewer than 50 days at the beginning of 2019.                                                                             , The Biden administration has undertaken a series of moves to try to alleviate bottlenecks both in the United States and abroad, including devoting $17 billion to improving American ports as part of the new infrastructure law. Major U.S. ports are handling more cargo than ever before and working through their backlog of containers — in part because ports have threatened additional fees for containers that sit too long in their yards.                                                                                                                                  , Yet those greater efficiencies have been undercut by continuing problems at other stages of the supply chain, including a shortage of truckers and warehouse workers to move the goods to their final destination. A push to make the Port of Los Angeles operate 24/7, which was the centerpiece of the Biden administration’s efforts to address supply chain issues this fall, has still seen few trucks showing up for overnight pickups, according to port officials, and cargo ships are still waiting for weeks outside West Coast ports for their turn for a berth to dock in., West Coast ports could see further disruptions this year as they renegotiate a labor contract for more than 22,000 dockworkers that expires on July 1. Previous negotiations led to work slowdowns and shipping delays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “If you have four closed doors to get through and one of them opens up, that doesn’t necessarily mean quick passage,” said Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport. “We should not delude ourselves that if our ports become 10 percent more efficient, we’ve solved the whole problem.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Chris Netram, the managing vice president for tax and domestic economic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, which represents 14,000 companies, said that American businesses had seen a succession of supply chain problems since the beginning of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “Right now, we are at the tail end of one flavor of those challenges, the port snarls,” he said, adding that Chinese lockdowns could be “the next flavor of this.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Manufacturers are watching carefully to see whether more factories and ports in China might be forced to shutter if Omicron spreads in the coming weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Neither Xi’an nor Henan Province, the site of China’s most expansive lockdowns, has an economy heavily reliant on exports, although Xi’an does produce some semiconductors, including for Samsung and Micron Technology, as well as commercial aircraft components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The pandemic sparked the problem. The highly intricate and interconnected global supply chain is in upheaval. Much of the crisis can be traced to the outbreak of Covid-19, which triggered an economic slowdown, mass layoffs and a halt to production. Here’s what happened next:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A reduction in shipping. With fewer goods being made and fewer people with paychecks to spend at the start of the pandemic, manufacturers and shipping companies assumed that demand would drop sharply. But that proved to be a mistake, as demand for some items would surge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Demand for protective gear spiked. In early 2020, the entire planet suddenly needed surgical masks and gowns. Most of these goods were made in China. As Chinese factories ramped up production, cargo vessels began delivering gear around the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Then, a shipping container shortage. Shipping containers piled up in many parts of the world after they were emptied. The result was a shortage of containers in the one country that needed them the most: China, where factories would begin pumping out goods in record volumes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Demand for durable goods increased. The pandemic shifted Americans’ spending from eating out and attending events to office furniture, electronics and kitchen appliances – mostly purchased online. The spending was also encouraged by government stimulus programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Strained supply chains. Factory goods swiftly overwhelmed U.S. ports. Swelling orders further outstripped the availability of shipping containers, and the cost of shipping a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles skyrocketed tenfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Labor shortages. Businesses across the economy, meanwhile, struggled to hire workers, including the truck drivers needed to haul cargo to warehouses. Even as employers resorted to lifting wages, labor shortages persisted, worsening the scarcity of goods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Component shortages. Shortages of one thing turned into shortages of others. A dearth of computer chips, for example, forced major automakers to slash production, while even delaying the manufacture of medical devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A lasting problem. Businesses and consumers reacted to shortages by ordering earlier and extra, especially ahead of the holidays, but that has placed more strain on the system. These issues are a key factor in rising inflation and are likely to last for months — if not longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Handel Jones, the chief executive of International Business Strategies, a chip consultancy, said the impact on Samsung and Micron would be limited, but he expressed worries about the potential for broader lockdowns in cities like Tianjin or Shanghai.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “What we’re concerned with now is, is Xi’an a template for other cities in China?” he asked. “If they can’t control it in the next two or three weeks, then I think you could have a significant impact on the supply chain. Right now, it’s kind of the tipping point.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Chinese authorities are experimenting with more narrowly targeted lockdowns. One example is in Shanghai, which announced on Thursday that it had identified five Covid cases at a milk tea shop that had been visited by a Chinese student who had recently returned from the United States. Rather than lock down the entire city or neighborhood, the government put emergency restrictions on the shop itself.                                                                                                                                                                     , Tim Huxley, the chairman of Mandarin Shipping, a Hong Kong-based container shipping line, said that social distancing rules, elaborate testing and other precautions had slightly reduced the efficiency of Chinese ports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But after considerable disruptions during lockdowns last year, Chinese docks have proved increasingly able to continue operating through municipal lockdowns. To forestall infections, they have barred ship crews from coming ashore and have required some dock workers to live for many weeks at a time in nearby dormitories instead of going home to their families at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , China plans similar arrangements to keep athletes and other foreigners completely separate from its population during the Winter Olympics next month. Beijing traffic authorities have even told residents to stay away from any vehicle collisions involving Olympic participants, to avoid infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Last year, terminal shutdowns in and around Ningbo and Shenzhen, respectively the world’s third- and fourth-largest container ports by volume, led to congestion and delays, and caused some ships to reroute to other ports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But if the coronavirus does manage to enter a big port again, the effects could quickly be felt in the United States. “If one of the big container terminals goes into lockdown,” Mr. Huxley said, “it doesn’t take long for a big backlog to develop.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Airfreight could also become more expensive and harder to obtain in the coming weeks as China has canceled dozens of flights to clamp down on another potential vector of infection. That could especially affect consumer electronics companies, which tend to ship high-value goods by air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , For American companies, the prospect of further supply chain troubles means there may be another scramble to secure Chinese-made products ahead of potential closures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Lisa Williams, the chief executive of the World of EPI, a company that makes multicultural dolls, said the supply chain issues were putting pressure on companies like hers to get products on the shelves faster than ever, with retailers asking for goods for the fall to be shipped as early as May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Dr. Williams, who was an academic specializing in logistics before she started her company, said an increase in the price of petroleum and other raw materials had pushed up the cost of the materials her company uses to make dolls, including plastic accessories, fibers for hair, fabrics for clothing and plastic for the dolls themselves. Her company has turned to far more expensive airfreight to get some shipments to the United States faster, further cutting into the firm’s margins.                                                                                 , “Everything is being moved up because everyone is anticipating the delay with supply chains,” she said. “So that compresses everything. It compresses the creativity, it compresses the amount of time we have to think through innovations we want to do.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Advertisement </td>

During that time, several more employees at ZiZi tested positive. The owner closed the restaurant for a week because there weren’t enough people to run it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , ZiZi has reopened, like many New York City restaurants that temporarily shuttered in December during the sudden onslaught of the Omicron variant. But the decisive moves those businesses took last month, and in earlier stages of the pandemic, have given way to something murkier — a time in which both employees and owners are deeply unsure what to do when they or co-workers test positive for the virus. Keep working and risk infecting others? Call in sick and miss out on crucial income? Close the restaurant to protect staff and customers, or take steps to safeguard them and stay open?, Mr. Peak agreed with ZiZi’s decision to close last month, but the continuing uncertainties have left him feeling bewildered and frustrated. When Sharon Hoota, an owner of the restaurant, and a manager recently called the city’s 311 help line three times to ask what to do if a worker tested positive for Covid, Mr. Hoota said they received differing advice on how soon that person should be allowed to return to work.                                                                                                                                                                           , “To be honest, in the beginning it was very clear what we should do,” Mr. Hoota said. “But now it’s changing a lot.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , While businesses throughout the country have had to calibrate their response to the Omicron variant, few places have been as hard hit as New York City, or as strict in requiring proof of vaccination, for all workers and anyone dining indoors. Many restaurants impose numerous safety precautions, including requirements that staff and customers wear masks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Yet many New Yorkers in the hospitality business say that the absence of other mandates or even consistent recommendations has left them to figure out how to react when workers become infected — and led to some stark disagreements about whether employers are acting responsibly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Sage Geyer closed his restaurant, Bar Meridian, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, from Dec. 17 to Dec. 27 after seven of its 12 employees tested positive for Covid. “We just threw up our hands, like, no one is telling us what to do here and we are so exhausted,” he said. “We don’t want to make the wrong decision.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Neither New York City nor the state requires restaurants to close if workers test positive for Covid. The city’s health department has updated its guidance for employers in response to the winter surge in cases. That advice includes encouraging testing, and ensuring that employees stay home if they feel sick or test positive. On Dec. 27, the department ordered that all on-site employees must be vaccinated.                                                                                                                                                                                   , President Biden has said that health and safety are paramount, while also emphasizing the need to keep businesses and schools running. In late December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shortened the isolation period recommended for people infected with Covid from 10 days to five, and did not require that they obtain a negative test result before coming out of isolation.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Many New York restaurants have stayed open even when they’ve learned that an employee has been infected. Breads Bakery, for example, hasn’t closed any of its four locations since the start of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , If an employee tests positive, that person must stay home for five days, then present a negative test result and be symptom-free for at least the past three days to return to work, said Gadi Peleg, the owner. Other employees can continue working without being tested if they don’t have symptoms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Even with all these safety measures, it has been a struggle. “The last month has been disappointing,” Mr. Peleg said. The bakeries have had more workers out sick than any other time during the pandemic. “It seems like we didn’t get the bang from the buck from getting everyone vaccinated.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Kaya Trefz, a barista at the location in Union Square, said some employees have been hesitant to get a Covid test because the bakery is short-staffed. If someone “has to call out to get tested, who is going to work and cover that?” she said. “There is a lot of stress and anxiety about that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Shannen Joachim said she quit her job as service director of the Midtown fine-dining restaurant Gabriel Kreuther in late December because she felt it wasn’t doing enough to protect staff and customers from Covid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , She said that last month, members of management encouraged several employees not to get tested, even if they had been exposed to the virus. She said the person in charge of the restaurant’s Covid protocols told her he didn’t believe the virus was real. One chef, she said, led mandatory breathing exercises on Saturdays before service in which many people were unmasked. (All of these allegations were corroborated by other employees.)                                                                                                                                                         , Ms. Joachim tested positive the day after she quit. “Now here I am, recovering from Covid, jobless, because they wouldn’t take things seriously,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , A spokeswoman for the restaurant wrote in an email that Ms. Joachim’s allegations were “entirely false and inaccurate,” adding that “Restaurant Gabriel Kreuther has and continues to comply with all requirements concerning Covid-19.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Sam Burros, who works in the bakery at Eataly, an Italian market and restaurant in the Flatiron district, said a co-worker called in sick on a recent Wednesday, telling her manager that she had just tested positive. The manager asked her to come back to work that Sunday, four days later, he said. She ultimately returned the following Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “She was talking to me and was like, ‘I still don’t feel great, I might still be positive,’” he said. (The co-worker, who asked not to be identified, confirmed the details of his account.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “Yes we are in ‘unprecedented times,’” Mr. Burros said, but the world has been dealing with the pandemic for two years. Just because a certain safety measure is not recommended by the government, managers feel they can overlook it, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , A spokesman for Eataly wouldn’t respond to Mr. Burros’s account. But he said in a statement that the company requires employees who test positive to isolate for five days after their first noticeable symptoms, and to “continue to quarantine after five days until the symptoms have resolved” and they no longer take medications for the symptoms. Anyone who returns to work must wear a medical-grade mask.                                                                                                                                                                                         , The latest Covid data in the U.S. As the Omicron surge caused case counts to reach record highs and hospitalizations to surpass last winter’s peak, here’s what the data suggests about the variant’s potential toll. Reports of falling infection rates in parts of the U.S., meanwhile, hint that a national peak may be approaching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The U.S. Covid response. President Biden announced that the U.S. government would deploy military personnel to help overwhelmed hospitals and buy 500 million more tests for distribution to Americans, doubling its previous purchase. Americans will be able to order free rapid tests online beginning Jan. 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Around the world. Some European countries have changed their approach to the virus to more closely align with how they handle the flu. Public health experts say the shift might be premature. In China, virus outbreaks and Omicron’s arrival weeks ahead of the Winter Olympics underscored the challenges of holding the Games while sticking to a “zero Covid” policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Staying safe. Worried about spreading Covid? Keep yourself and others safe by following some basic guidance on when to test, which mask to pick and how to use at-home virus tests. Here is what to do if you test positive for the coronavirus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “Given New York City’s surge of the Omicron variant,” the statement added, “we continue to take careful consideration to best protect our staff and adhere to city, state and federal public health best practices.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Saru Jayaraman, the president of One Fair Wage, an advocacy group for restaurant workers, said the Omicron surge, coupled with a citywide shortage of restaurant workers — which is more acute in New York than in any other state — will prompt even more people to leave the business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “People should be able to be sick, and the restaurant should close if there are multiple people who are sick,” she said. But workers, she added, are often forced to choose between their safety and a paycheck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed legislation in April 2020 requiring that employers with five or more employees and a net annual income of $1 million or more give at least five days of paid sick leave to employees if they are ordered to isolate or quarantine because of Covid-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , But Ms. Jayaraman said city and state officials have not done an adequate job communicating with employers about paid sick leave, and employers, in turn, have not done enough to let restaurant workers know that they qualify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , After Nikolas Vagenas, a bartender at Apotheke in Chinatown and Bar Meridian in Brooklyn, tested positive for the virus in mid-December, he tried to apply for unemployment benefits both over the phone and online. The website “was supercomplicated,” he said. “I called them and waited on the phone, and they said I didn’t qualify.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Asked whether restaurant workers who test positive for the virus are eligible for unemployment, a spokesman for New York State said: “Unemployment determinations are made on a case-by-case basis, but restaurant workers are eligible for unemployment under the same standards as every other worker.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But Ms. Jayaraman noted that the state’s eligibility requirements for unemployment include being “ready, willing and able” to work, according to the New York labor department website, and specify that “you may not file for a week when you work more than 30 hours or earn more than $504 gross pay between Monday and Sunday.” This would make it difficult for anyone in isolation for just a week or so to qualify as “able” to work, or deem it worthwhile even to apply, she said.                                                                                                                 , Getting information about unemployment benefits and best practices for restaurants can be a challenge. A New York Times reporter who reached out to both city and state officials to clarify their health guidance was directed back and forth among multiple departments over two days, and several specific questions went unanswered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Olivia Sternberg, a server at Le Crocodile, a French bistro in Williamsburg, tested positive shortly before Christmas, and the restaurant gave her two weeks of paid sick leave. Managers and owners checked in on her regularly, she said, to see how she was doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Feeling taken care of by her employer gave her a measure of relief, but she still has concerns: Will customers want to dine indoors during yet another surge, in the dead of winter? Will vaccination requirements change, and if they do, how will guests react?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “Here we go again,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Top Republican on foreign affairs committee believes US is in new cold war with Russia - CNNPolitics </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Sunday he thinks the US is engaged in a new cold war with Russia amid high tensions between the nations over Russia's potential invasion of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                            , "I do. I do, because I think (Russia President Vladimir) Putin again smells weakness here," Rep. Michael McCaul, a Republican of Texas, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" when asked whether he thinks there's a new cold war happening.                                                                                                                                                                , His comments come after CNN reported the US has information that indicates Russia has prepositioned a group of operatives to potentially conduct a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to create a pretext for an invasion.                                                                                                                                                                        , "He knows that if he's ever going to invade Ukraine, now is the time. I hope he doesn't make that miscalculation. But the fact is, if he does invade Ukraine, what is the United States, what is our commander-in-chief prepared to do to stop it?" McCaul said.                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "If Putin sees deterrence coming back from the United States and our NATO allies, he may second guess his calculation to invade Ukraine. Now Ukraine is the breadbasket of Russia. Putin wants to restore the glory of the old Soviet empire. He's been wanting to do this for quite some time."                                                                                                                     , McCaul added: "I'm not seeing a lot of deterrence.

"Just about every major bank and discount broker launched one in the past decade."                                                                                                   , Robots tend to be especially well-suited to newer investors who haven't yet built much wealth, and who would like to outsource money management to a professional for a reasonably low cost, according to industry experts.                                                                                    , For one, robo-advisors offer a low barrier to entry, due to low or nonexistent account minimums.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Acorns, Fidelity Go, Betterment and Ellevest, a robo service for women, let clients sign up for their baseline digital service without any prior wealth. Merrill Edge Guided Investing, SigFig, SoFi, Vanguard Group and Wealthfront have minimums ranging from a few dollars up to $3,000.                    , Meanwhile, traditional firms tend to manage money for clients with at least $250,000 to invest, Goldstone said.                                                                                                                                                                                                , It's perhaps unsurprising that the average robo user skews younger. For example, about 90% of the 470,000 clients at Wealthfront are under 40, said Elly Stolnitz, a company spokeswoman. Their average balance is about $60,000.                                                                              , That demographic trend is also a function of a greater digital affinity among millennials and Generation Z, who largely grew up as digital natives and may be more attracted to a robo service as a result.                                                                                                    , "[Our users] want to be able to manage money the same way they manage other things, like [online food delivery via] DoorDash," Stolnitz said.                                                                                                                                                                  , Betterment also has an average user younger than 40, with a $55,000 to $60,000 account, according to Dan Egan, the firm's vice president of behavioral finance and investing.                                                                                                                                  , But age and wealth aren't the only factors at play, he said. The company has clients in their 60s and 70s with multimillion-dollar portfolios; the oldest user is over 90.                                                                                                                                     , "I think it attracts people who want to delegate away management of their portfolio," Egan said.                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Fees for that management are typically much lower than for a traditional financial advisor charging 1% a year on client assets. The typical robo charges 0.25% to 0.35% annually for their advice service — about a fourth of the cost, Goldstone said.                                                        , In dollar terms, that means an investor with $100,000 would pay the typical human $1,000 a year for their services, and $250 to the average robo. (Of course, not all human advisors charge a 1% fee. Some have shifted to monthly subscription fees or one-time consultation fees, for example.)              , Some robo-advisors like Charles Schwab and SoFi don't levy any advice fee; others like Fidelity and SigFig only charge on balances of more than $10,000.                                                                                                                                                       , Investments in the portfolio — often low-cost index mutual funds or exchange-traded funds — do carry an additional fee. Some firms invest clients in their name-brand funds, which boosts their revenue via fund fees. They may also levy higher account minimums or fees for tiered service levels.           , "If you don't have a lot of money, you're in your 20s and 30s, the portfolios are pretty damn good," said William Whitt, a strategic advisor at Aite-Novarica Group, a consulting firm.                                                                                                                        , Using a purely digital service may come with trade-offs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , While digital services do a good job of automating important investment functions (fund choice, the stock-bond-cash mix, and regular portfolio rebalancing, for example), human advisors lament the relative inability of algorithmic programs to talk clients through situations on demand.                   , Those may include the reasoning behind a specific strategy recommendation, or handholding in daunting times like job loss or a cratering stock market.                                                                                                                                                         , Financial planners also believe they're better suited for proactivity and delving into needs of some clients beyond money management — whether tax, estate or business planning, which may prove too complex or nuanced for an online questionnaire, for example.                                              , "We do a lot more than just investing," said Johnson at Delancey Wealth Management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Helping a client choose whether to exercise stock options, buy long-term-care or liability insurance, or set up a business as an LLC or another type of entity are likely beyond the scope of a digital advisor, Johnson said.                                                                                 , It's also a challenge to automate client psychology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The online questionnaires robo-advisors use to determine the best portfolio for a client can't probe answers and body language in the same way a human advisor might, Whitt said.                                                                                                                              , Even determining what makes a client happy — in essence, the purpose behind their money — may be beyond the scope of robots, according to some experts.                                                                                                                                                        , "Financial advisors can ask follow-up questions to fill out a picture and understand," Whitt said.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The Securities and Exchange Commission, which conducted a recent review of robo-advice services, also questioned whether they always recommended appropriate portfolios given clients' stated risk tolerance. (The agency didn't name specific firms it examined.)                                             , Of course, not all human advisors are necessarily performing these functions appropriately, either. Some may purely manage client investments, without assessing goals or other complex financial-planning details — and in this case, clients might get more value from a robo-advice relationship.           , "I think there's value humans provide," said Brian Walsh, SoFi's senior manager of financial planning. "But on the investment side, I think robos have a huge advantage in being cost-efficient."                                                                                                              , Robo platforms have also evolved to account for some criticisms and cater to a broader pool of investors.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , For one, many have expanded to offer more intricate levels of "goals-based" planning; they can assemble investment and saving recommendations based on short- and long-term goals like saving for a home, vacation, college fund or retirement.                                                                , Many now offer a "hybrid" offering that provides access to one-off interactions with a financial planner or even an ongoing relationship with a human advisor.                                                                                                                                                 , Charles Schwab's premium service, for example, charges $300 up front for a planning consultation and a $30 monthly subscription fee for access to human advice, which supplements its digital investment management.                                                                                           , Even at Wealthfront — which considers it "a failure of our product if you have to call us" — users are able to call a hotline to speak with accountants, CFPs and financial analysts if they have a question, Stolnitz said.                                                                                   , Ultimately, whether a robot or a human manages your money comes down to what an investor wants from the relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                          , "I think robo-advisors are good — it gives investors more options," Johnson said. "I'd hate a world where people could only invest one way."                                                                                                                                                                   , Disclosure: NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures are investors in Acorns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Got a confidential news tip?

Parts of the mandate were scheduled to take effect on Monday. The ruling does not affect state or city requirements for employers to mandate vaccines, including the one that recently went into effect in New York City. But without a federal rule, bans on employer vaccine mandates in states like Texas will remain in effect, and some businesses said that it would be more difficult to require vaccination for employees without the cover of a federal mandate.                                                                                                         , When demand for oil plunged during the first months of the pandemic, the world’s oil-producing countries agreed to dramatically cut production. Now, they’re having trouble ramping up again, repeatedly falling short of monthly targets. Production in the United States has also been slow to recover. Uncertainty about future demand as the pandemic continues its grip along with climate change concerns have made investment in new drilling scarce; with demand outpacing supply, oil prices have risen to seven-year highs. Forecasters are split on whether supply will catch up — and prices will fall — later this year.                                                                                                                       , Many Americans are having trouble finding rapid coronavirus tests. But for those who work at companies like Google, BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase, access to free coronavirus tests is a new wellness perk. Two announcements last week aimed to level the playing field: The Biden administration plans to purchase 500 million more tests for Americans, in addition to the 500 million that it had already announced it would supply; and private insurance companies will be required to foot the bill for up to eight tests a month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The federal government on Thursday will release the number of Americans in unions last year. Despite staffing shortages that have given workers some leverage, and difficult working conditions that have added to labor unrest, union membership is unlikely to have grown much; the number of union elections last year remained low. But the labor movement has made progress in other ways. Since three Starbucks stores filed for union elections in August, at least 15 others nationwide followed, showing the potential of a strategy that builds momentum by focusing on small workplaces at high-profile companies.                                                                                                                               , Are you ready for tax season? The Internal Revenue Service is not. On Monday, it warned taxpayers that staffing shortages and paperwork backlogs would mean a lower level of service when Americans file their taxes from Jan. 24 to April 18 this year. The agency, which has had its budget and work force slashed in recent years, was charged with administering stimulus payments and other programs during the pandemic. That has helped create a backlog of at least 10 million unprocessed returns from last year, according to a report by the national taxpayer advocate released on Wednesday. The Biden administration has asked for an additional $80 billion over the next 10 years to bolster enforcement and customer service at the agency., The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was scheduled to begin on Monday but was postponed last month because of coronavirus concerns. The absence of billionaires and world leaders in Davos highlighted the annual conference’s economic impact of on the city, as well as a divergence in how organizers of large events have reacted to the Omicron variant. While Davos and the Grammy Awards were postponed, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas went ahead with in–person events earlier this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The latest Covid data in the U.S. As the Omicron surge caused case counts to reach record highs and hospitalizations to surpass last winter’s peak, here’s what the data suggests about the variant’s potential toll. Reports of falling infection rates in parts of the U.S., meanwhile, hint that a national peak may be approaching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The U.S. Covid response. President Biden announced that the U.S. government would deploy military personnel to help overwhelmed hospitals and buy 500 million more tests for distribution to Americans, doubling its previous purchase. Americans will be able to order free rapid tests online beginning Jan. 19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Around the world. Some European countries have changed their approach to the virus to more closely align with how they handle the flu. Public health experts say the shift might be premature. In China, virus outbreaks and Omicron’s arrival weeks ahead of the Winter Olympics underscored the challenges of holding the Games while sticking to a “zero Covid” policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Staying safe. Worried about spreading Covid? Keep yourself and others safe by following some basic guidance on when to test, which mask to pick and how to use at-home virus tests. Here is what to do if you test positive for the coronavirus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , President Biden nominated three new Federal Reserve officials. Airlines continued to struggle with staffing shortages. Bank of America cut its overdraft fees. And the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who earlier this month was found guilty on three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, will be sentenced on Sept. 26.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> London (CNN)Before Covid-19, Nicolas Rimoldi had never attended a protest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , But somewhere along the pandemic's long and tortuous road, which saw his native Switzerland imposing first one lockdown, then another, and finally introducing vaccination certificates, Rimoldi decided he had had enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Now he leads Mass-Voll, one of Europe's largest youth-orientated anti-vaccine passport groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Because he has chosen not to get vaccinated, student and part-time supermarket cashier Rimoldi is -- for now, at least -- locked out of much of public life. Without a vaccine certificate, he can no longer complete his degree or work in a grocery store. He is barred from eating in restaurants, attending concerts or going to the gym.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "People without a certificate like me, we're not a part of society anymore," he said. "We're excluded. We're like less valuable humans."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , As the pandemic has moved into its third year, and the Omicron variant has sparked a new wave of cases, governments around the world are still grappling with the challenge of bringing the virus under control. Vaccines, one of the most powerful weapons in their armories, have been available for a year but a small, vocal minority of people -- such as Rimoldi -- will not take them.                                                                                                                                                     , Faced with lingering pockets of vaccine hesitancy, or outright refusal, many nations are imposing ever stricter rules and restrictions on unvaccinated people, effectively making their lives more difficult in an effort to convince them to get their shots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , In doing so, they are testing the boundary between public health and civil liberties -- and heightening tensions between those who are vaccinated and those who are not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , "We will not allow a tiny minority of unhinged extremists to impose its will on our entire society," Germany's new Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said last month, targeting the violent fringes of the anti-vaccine movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Vaccine passports have been in place for months to gain entry to hospitality venues in much of the European Union. But as Delta and Omicron infections have surged and inoculation rollouts have stalled, some governments have gone further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Austria imposed Europe's first lockdown for the unvaccinated and is scheduled to introduce mandatory shots from February 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Germany has banned unvaccinated people from most areas of public life, and the country's Health Minister, Karl Lauterbach, warned in December that: "without mandatory vaccination I do not see us managing further waves in the long term."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , And France's President Emmanuel Macron last week told Le Parisien newspaper that he "really wants to piss off" the unvaccinated.

Unlike in poorer parts of the world where some are desperate to receive doses, access to Covid-19 vaccines is plentiful in the EU.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The effects of the shots have been clear for some time; across Europe, regions with lower rates of vaccine uptake have suffered more severe waves of hospitalizations and deaths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in November that the lives of 470,000 people in Europe aged 60 and over have been saved by vaccines since the rollout began, though it has cautioned against vaccine mandates except as "an absolute last resort ... only applicable when all other feasible options to improve vaccine uptake have been exhausted." WHO's regional director for Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge, warned in December that: "What is acceptable in one society and community may not be effective and acceptable in another." , Rimoldi insists that his group is "not anti-mask" and "not anti-vax" -- concerned purely with democracy and legality, rather than the science of the vaccine -- though its social media pages have recirculated extreme anti-vaccination websites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "At our demonstrations there's many people who are fully vaccinated," he claimed, adding: "They say, 'Hey, the government lied to us'" about vaccine rollouts meaning the end of Covid restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , He was unwilling to discuss the vaccine itself, saying only that he refused it as a matter of principle. "We don't talk much about the vaccine ... that's not one of the topics we discuss," he said when asked whether he agreed the shots had done more good than harm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Several campaigners CNN spoke to also expressed concerns that each new set of rules imposed in the name of halting the spread of coronavirus was part of a "slippery slope" of never-ending restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But vaccine passports or some form of certification -- the measures that Rimoldi and others protest loudly -- appear to have aided rollouts. A study by the University of Oxford, published in December, found that such policies have led more people to take up the shot ​​in France, Israel, Switzerland and Italy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Alexander Schallenberg, the former Austrian Chancellor who imposed a lockdown on his country's unvaccinated population, said in November that its vaccine uptake was "shamefully low." At the time around 65% of Austria's population was fully inoculated against Covid-19 -- one of the lower rates in the EU -- but recent stricter measures have seen that rate rise to over 70%.                                                                                                                                                             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Families divided                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , As controls have tightened, groups such as Rimoldi's have become increasingly disruptive; few weekends now pass without loud protests in European cities. And anger at restrictive Covid measures has led many who previously considered themselves apolitical to join in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Even before the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy in Europe was strongly correlated to a populist distrust of mainstream parties and governments. One study published in the European Journal of Public Health in 2019 found "a highly significant positive association between the percentage of people in a country who voted for populist parties and the percentage who believe that vaccines are not important and not effective."                                                                                                                 , But leaders of anti-restriction movements are presenting their campaigns as more inclusive and representative than those studies would suggest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "We have farmers, lawyers, artists, musicians -- the whole range of people you can imagine," Rimoldi said. Mass-Voll is aimed specifically at Swiss young people, and boasts that it has amassed more followers on Instagram than the official youth wings of any of the country's major political parties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Christian Fiala, the vice president of Austria's MFG party, which was formed specifically to oppose lockdowns, mask-wearing and Covid passports, told CNN: "It's really a movement which comes from the whole population."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , MFG caused a ballot box shock last September, winning seats in one of Austria's provincial parliaments. "Most of those who voted for us have never been really politically active in that sense, but they are so upset," he said. "People are really fed up being locked in."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , In France, vaccination uptake is higher but those opposed to Covid rules are no quieter. Bruno Courcelle said he was not overly involved in politics before the pandemic -- now the 72-year-old mathematics lecturer is a regular at demonstrations against the vaccine, lockdowns and other Covid control measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , His stance has left him at odds with family, friends and colleagues. Speaking to CNN before Christmas, Courcelle was preparing for an uncomfortable festive family dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "The rest of my family got vaccinated," he said, adding that he has had several arguments with relatives who fail to understand why he has joined the ranks of the anti-vaccination protesters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "My wife said 'Please, do not say anything [at the table],'" he said.

"This is disappointing," he said. "I've sent emails to my close colleagues [about the vaccine] ...

"It's like a fraternity or being a fan of a football club." People skeptical of government messaging are "looking for something social, and these groups have done an excellent job at inviting whoever will come," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "I have met new people who share [my] opinions," said Courcelle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Fuel on the fire                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Two years on, and with opinions becoming more entrenched by the day, some experts fear it may be too late to bridge the divide between the authorities and those who have become vociferously opposed to vaccination measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "Those people who are against vaccination are going to be even louder whenever they're told: 'You vaccinate, or you die.'

Ward estimates that between 5 and 10% of France's population is staunchly against the vaccine; a large rally against the vaccine pass, approved by France's lower house last Thursday, took place in Paris on Saturday.                                                                                                                     , Those who refuse to get inoculated may accuse vaccine passport-wielding politicians of turning them into second-class citizens, but the French President, like many of his European counterparts, is unrepentant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Macron insists those who do not protect themselves and those around them from Covid-19 by getting vaccinated are "irresponsible" and thus deserving of such a fate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , "When my freedom threatens that of others, I become irresponsible," he said.

Companies make climate pledges. Economists discuss inequality.

Last year, the forum abandoned Davos and planned to hold the meeting in Singapore during the summer, but the Singapore event got canceled, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , This year’s event was scheduled to begin on Monday and proceed more or less as usual. Multinational corporations were renting out suites in luxury hotels.

And for a second year in a row, with Davos the event on hold, the town of Davos, Switzerland, is stuck in limbo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Before the pandemic, “Davos” came to connote not simply the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum itself, but a state of mind. Pro-capitalism, pro-democracy, pro-globalization, Davos is the spiritual home of the stakeholder capitalism movement (which encourages companies to be better corporate citizens) and a testing ground for any number of new win-win market-oriented solutions to combat climate change, ameliorate hunger and repair frayed international relations.                                                                                       , More practically, Davos also came to refer to an entire universe of satellite events, subconferences and loosely affiliated marketing stunts that all took place in Switzerland throughout mid-January. Facebook constructed a temporary headquarters on the town’s main thoroughfare, known as the Promenade. Salesforce held a private lunch in a giant geodesic dome.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Yet no matter what party might be going on or which company had the best off-site augmented reality installation, the inner sanctum of Davos has always been the Congress Centre, a convention space that serves as the gathering’s nexus and main stage. It is where, in 2020, you might have found Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany or President Donald J. Trump addressing a crowd of thousands while, in an adjacent lobby area, Jane Goodall took in a demonstration of Google’s new mapping technology.                                                                , Normally packed with lanyard-wearing conference goers hustling from a meditation session led by monks to a panel discussion about sovereign wealth funds, the halls of the Congress Centre are, for the time being at least, empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Besides delivering Switzerland a helping of cultural cachet, the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting is major source of revenue for the national and local economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The 2020 meeting, the last one held in person, contributed about $120 million to the Swiss economy, according to a study by University of St. Gallen that was commissioned by the forum. The bulk of that, roughly $70 million, was spent in Davos, which has a year-round population of about 11,000 people. That number essentially doubles when the forum comes to town.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Hotels, and in particular the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère, will feel the pain particularly acutely. During the annual meeting, the Belvédère has its own center of gravity, erecting temporary structures to accommodate additional meeting rooms, allowing television networks to set up on its roof and hosting a constant string of receptions in its various bars.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Normally, it is all but impossible to get a room there during the third week of January, with rooms ranging from $1,000 to $10,000, if they are available. Now, during what is usually its busiest time of the year, rooms at the Belvédère are available for less than $300 a night on Expedia.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Whether the organizers will be able to pull off a gathering in Davos this summer remains up in the air. Cases are skyrocketing around the globe. Switzerland has introduced new restrictions as hospitals in the country are once again strained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “It was a smart thing to do to not be hosting it right now,” said Valerie Keller, a Davos regular and co-founder of Imagine, a company that works with executives to improve the state of the world and whose mission board includes Richard Branson and Arianna Huffington. “It would have been totally negligent if we were all in Davos right now.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , And still, is Davos really Davos without Davos? The town, or at least its name, has taken on a totemic significance that far eclipses its modest population. The term “Davos Man” has come to describe individuals so wealthy and powerful that they play by their own set of rules, and write the rules for the rest of us. The annual meeting has come to define the place more than the mountains, the ski slopes or the mulled wine served in chalet taverns. Even onetime critics of the World Economic Forum have come around and now embrace its singular place in Davos., “In my early days, I was demonstrating during the W.E.F. for better action against climate change and social justice,” Philipp Wilhelm, the mayor of Davos, told the Guardian after last year’s event was canceled. “Now, I am trying to get the W.E.F. back to Davos.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

Losing its slot on the DirecTV lineup will almost certainly diminish the network’s overall audience and cut into its annual revenue.                                                                                                                        , DirecTV on Saturday did not elaborate on the precise reasons behind its decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “We informed Herring Networks that, following a routine internal review, we do not plan to enter into a new contract when our current agreement expires,” a spokesman for DirecTV said in an email on Saturday. DirecTV plans to also drop a second channel owned by the Herrings called AWE, which features lifestyle and entertainment programs.                                                                                                           , Herring Networks did not respond on Saturday to requests for comment. The move by DirecTV was first reported by Bloomberg News.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Chanel Rion, the chief White House correspondent for One America News, derided DirecTV in a Twitter post on Friday that referred to the decision to drop the channel. “With moves like this, DirecTV will have to become state-owned to survive,” Ms. Rion wrote, adding, “They would have better luck in Pyongyang.”                                                                                                                                        , One America News, which is based in San Diego, started in 2013. Beginning with the 2016 election, the network acted as a venue for viewpoints and coverage aligned with Donald J. Trump and his right-wing allies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Its anchors have regularly questioned the outcome of the 2020 election. The network is facing defamation lawsuits from two election technology companies, Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems, that have accused the channel of spreading falsehoods that they manipulated vote tallies to swing the election to Joseph R. Biden Jr.                                                                                                                      , One America News has also promoted the false theory that left-wing agitators, and not Trump supporters, were the primary instigators of the Capitol riot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , This month, on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack, One America News ran a segment about “the patriotic demonstrations at the Capitol on Jan. 6” that suggested the attack was a so-called “false flag” operation by liberals intended to strip patriotic Americans of their liberties. “Leftist, Media Narrative Surrounding January 6th, 2021 Simply an Excuse for Democrats to Seize Power,” read an onscreen headline.                                  , The channel has also aired false and misleading reports about the safety and efficacy of coronavirus vaccines. In June, one anchor, Pearson Sharp, told viewers: “The fallout from the coronavirus vaccine continues to grow, and the toll on human life is now worse than anyone could have imagined.”                                                                                                                                                      , DirecTV is one of only a few major television distributors that carries One America News; another is Verizon Fios. The channel is also available to stream online, and it maintains a popular YouTube page with more than 1.4 million subscribers.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , One America News and DirecTV have a complex history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The channel has been carried by DirecTV since 2017, in the wake of a lawsuit filed the previous year by Herring Networks against AT&amp;T, the former owner of DirecTV. (Although DirecTV is now independent, AT&amp;T has retained a significant stake.) A Reuters report last year, citing testimony from a network employee in a separate lawsuit, said that One America News had relied heavily on fees paid by AT&amp;T-affiliated platforms to fund its operations., Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> McDonald's locations have cut hours by 10% due to staffing shortages: CEO </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi explains the 'confluence of events' leading to the labor shortages as data revealed a record number of Americans quit their jobs in November 2021.                                                                                                                                               , McDonald's and its franchisees have cut operational hours in response to a lack of employees at a number of its U.S. locations because of coronavirus staffing shortages.                                                                                                                                                           , The Golden Arches, similar to many restaurants around the country, have struggled with consistent employee attendance during the COVID-19 surge brought on by the omicron variant as infections reach record levels. Restaurant industry data shows a dip in sales at the end of December.                                          , Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's Corp. CEO who assumed the role back in November 2019, says adjusting during these times is one of many priorities for the company's growth and well-being.                                                                                                                                            , The pandemic hurt McDonald's flourishing breakfast business after a decline in morning commuters. It was able to bounce back after American cities allowed for drive-thru lanes to remain open. The fast-food chain's sales returned to pre-pandemic levels by March 2021.                                                          , ISRAEL MCDONALD'S KIOSK DENIES SERVIES TO PEOPLE WITHOUT VALID GREEN PASS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Over the past two years, the company has embraced celebrity partnerships with rappers Travis Scott and Saweetie and Korean pop group BTS. While new menu items from these partnerships only lasted for a limited time, the promotions helped to boost sales past pre-pandemic levels.                                               , As far as the safety of employees, McDonald's has provided COVID tests McDonald's franchises for employees but has no way to track whether someone has contracted the virus or not. Kempczinki says that should be the responsibility of a healthcare agency.                                                                       , McDonald's and its franchises employ close to 800,000 people in the U.S.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Supreme Court said no to the mandate earlier this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In a time where 2021 was dubbed The Great Resignation, due to a record-breaking year for Americans who quit their jobs, McDonald's works to pivot and make the necessary adjustments. As of now Chris Kempczinki says he'll continue to plan for the future of the company, but doesn't bank on longevity as leader of the company. , "I’d say I’m a little bit more Zen about just everything that goes into the job," he says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , McDonald's is not the only fast-food chain to be hit with staffing shortages as a result of COVID-19.  Wall Street Journal reports that Shake Shack Inc. noted its own December dip in productivity as well.                                                                                                                        , Editor's note: The headline and this story have been updated to reflect the distinction between McDonald's Corporation and its Franchisees.                                                                                                                                                                                         , The Wall Street Journal contributed to this report.  </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> GlaxoSmithKline has rejected three Unilever offers to buy its consumer goods division, including one worth £50bn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , GSK said the proposals "fundamentally failed" to reflect the value of the division.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , With a successful bid, Unilever - which owns Marmite, Dove and PG Tips - would add Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol to its list of household brands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Such a deal would be one of the biggest ever involving London-listed firms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , GSK said in a statement the most recent proposal from Unilever on 20 December contained an offer for £41.7bn in cash and £8.3bn in Unilever shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The global healthcare company, which has its headquarters in London, has already been preparing to separate its consumer goods division from its pharmaceutical business in the middle of this year.                                                                                                                                                                                        , The firm has come under pressure from investors for failing to develop a Covid vaccine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Unilever said in a statement the GSK consumer arm "would be a strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The consumer goods giant, which became a fully British company in 2020 after previously being separated between the UK and the Netherlands, also approached Pfizer about the potential deal, since the American pharmaceutical giant owns a 34% stake in GSK's consumer goods business.                                                                                                     , Neither GSK nor Pfizer has any ideological objection to selling to Unilever. GSK had planned to spin off its consumer business later this year anyway through a demerger creating a separate publicly listed company but always said it would have an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right.                                                                    , GSK's problem with the Unilever bid is that the price isn't right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Both Barclays and Goldman Sachs analysts have valued the business at around £50bn. However, that does not include a few important things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , First, the premium you would normally expect to pay for taking control of a business - somewhere in the range of 30% - although that might be reduced by the debt of about £10bn GSK was expected to leave on the books of the consumer business.                                                                                                                                           , Second, the value of the cost savings GSK admits could be made to make the business more profitable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Third, it may not reflect the higher sales growth targets GSK boss Emma Walmsley has said are possible for the business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , She has also said the benefit of a demerger is current GSK shareholders would get shares in the demerged business so retain their participation in any future growth in the consumer business.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Some will say if higher growth and greater cost reductions are possible, why haven't they happened already? Emma Walmsley has been in charge for more than four years. That's one of the questions activist shareholder Elliot Management has implicitly asked by encouraging other shareholders to agitate for a more radical greater break up of one of the UK's most valuable companies. , The BBC understands the very different ideas on what this business is worth means there are no active and ongoing discussions between GSK and Unilever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But Unilever's intentions are very clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The "for sale" sign is now very visible and the elbows will get sharper as this basket of household consumer goods gets closer to the checkout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Unilever's chief executive Alan Jope was under pressure because the business had recently missed targets for sales and profit margins.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "Unilever has strong cashflow, but the heat is on Mr Jope.

Many investors see GSK as underperforming. But at a time when inflation is rising, consumer goods with loyal customers represent a good way for firms to try to manage profits."                                                                                                                                                                             , The move was first reported in the Sunday Times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , GSK said its consumer goods division had the potential to increase sales by up to 6% a year in the medium term, and Unilever's offers did not take that into account. It said the proposals were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders.                                                                                                                                             , Preliminary figures show sales for GSK's consumer division reached £9.6bn in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Other brands in the division include Centrum vitamins, Aquafresh toothpaste and Nicorette gum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The company has said it is in late stage trails of a Covid vaccine it was developing with the French pharmaceutical firm, Sanofi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , What is it really like to live in Dubai?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Why is it better to stroll earlier in the day?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , © 2022 BBC.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Fed is about to see a lot of new faces. What it means for banks, the economy and markets </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In what likely will be just a few months' time, the Federal Reserve will look a lot different: Three new governors, a new vice chairman, a new banking chief and likely a couple new regional presidents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , But while the parts of the institution's upper echelon may change quite a bit, the whole could look pretty much the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , That's because Fed-watchers think ideologically there probably will be little change, even if Sarah Bloom Raskin, Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson are confirmed as new members on the Board of Governors. White House sources say President Joe Biden will nominate the trio in the coming days.                                                                                                                                       , Of the three, Raskin is thought to be the biggest change agent. She is expected to take a heavier hand in her prospective role as the vice chair for bank supervision, a position until December that had been held by Randal Quarles, who took a lighter touch.                                                                                                                                                                      , But while Raskin could ramp up the rhetoric on the financial system, there are questions over how much that actually will translate into policy-wise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "She's a former regulator. She knows this stuff. This is not something she's going to screw up," said Christopher Whalen, founder of Whalen Global Advisors and a a former Fed researcher. "The bankers will be surprised that the rhetoric is going to be maybe a little bit more extreme. But the substance? What are they going to do to these guys? It's not like they take a lot of risks."                                      , Indeed, the level of high-quality capital U.S. banks are holding compared to risk assets has progressed continually higher since the financial crisis of 2008, from 11.4% at the end of 2009 to 15.7% as of the third quarter in 2011, according to Fed data.                                                                                                                                                                         , Still, the banking industry has remained a favorite target of congressional Democrats, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is thought to have favored Raskin for the supervision role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Yet the nominee's biggest impact could come in some of the ancillary places where the Fed had dipped its toes recently, such as the push to get banks to plan for the financial impact of climate-related events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , "The main point of controversy in her confirmation will be around climate policy where she has in the past expressed support for implementing both Fed monetary and regulatory policy in a way that promotes the green transition," Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy for Evercore ISI.                                                                                                                   , While Guha sees Raskin "adopting a materially firmer line on regulation" than Quarles, he also sees her as being "pragmatic" on issues such as reform in the Treasury market, specifically pandemic-era changes to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio. The SLR dictates the weighting for assets banks hold, and industry leaders have called for changes to differentiate between things like Treasurys and other far riskier holdings., The financial system also has continued to see unusual trends in the pandemic era, such as dramatically higher liquidity demand from the Fed's overnight reverse repo agreements, where banks can exchange high-quality assets for cash. The operations set a single-day record on New Year's Eve in 2021 with nearly $2 trillion changing hands, and Thursday's activity saw more than $1.6 trillion in transactions.                , Those issues will demand attention from Raskin, as will broader questions of monetary policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Cook and Jefferson are expected to bring dovish views to the board, meaning they favor looser policy on interest rates and other such matters. If confirmed, though, they would come to the board a time when the Fed is pushing toward a more hawkish approach, teeing up rate hikes and other tightening moves in an effort to control inflation.                                                                                   , "We think it would be a mistake to view them as likely to form a hardline dovish bloc on arrival and oppose the hawkish shift in Fed policy underway," Guha wrote. "Rather, we think they – like [Governor Lael] Brainard and other erstwhile doves [Mary] Daly and [Charles] Evans – will view policy as a game of two halves and explain what this means and how it may play out."                                                  , Goldman Sachs has a bunch of new buy-rated stocks — and says 5 have upside of more than 90%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Here are Wall Street analysts five favorite stocks heading into earnings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The reasons behind the market's turbulent start to 2022 and why the bears are not yet in control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Daly is the San Francisco Fed president while Evans helms the central bank's Chicago operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , They, among multiple other policymakers in recent days, have talked about the need to raise rates. So even if the new trio of officials would come in wanting to hit the brakes on policy tightening, they'd likely be drowned out by a desire to curb price increases running at their highest rate in nearly 40 years. The Fed also is expected to halt its monthly asset purchases in March                                        , Where the board seems less decisive is on reducing some of the more than $8.8 trillion in assets the Fed is holding. Some officials at the December meeting said balance sheet reduction could start shortly after rate hikes begin, but others in recent days have expressed uncertainty about the process.                                                                                                                          , "People want the Fed to do something about inflation. But as growth starts to slow around the spring, people aren't going to way to pay higher borrowing costs," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis and chief economist for the National Economic Council under former President Donald Trump.                                                                                                         , "They're going to be pretty dovish on the rates side, and may indeed push back on the balance sheet reduction," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Other changes for the Fed will see Brainard likely take over as vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy. The position effectively makes her Chairman Jerome Powell's top lieutenant; statements during her Senate confirmation hearing Thursday indicate she likely will be voted through.                                                                                                   , There also are two regional president positions open, after Boston's Eric Rosengren and Dallas' Robert Kaplan resigned last year amid controversy over market trades by Fed officials in the early days of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Whalen, the former Fed official, said the new policymakers will have plenty to keep them busy though they aren't likely to push for wholesale changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , "I think Fed governors actually may spend more time this year talking nuts and bolts of financial markets than they have the last couple of years," he said. "It's very clear they made mistakes. Yet, they're not very good at saying that."                                                                                                                                                                                         , Got a confidential news tip?

So when the 18-year-old high schooler heard a sequel was coming this year, he knew he had to buy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , That was until GSC Game World, the Ukrainian company behind the computer game, announced last month that the new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. would incorporate the crypto-based assets known as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. In the new game, GSC said, players could buy and sell NFTs of items like clothing for their in-game characters. The company heralded the move as a “transformative step” toward the virtual world known as the metaverse.                                                                                                                     , Mr. Lantz was incensed. He joined thousands of fans on Twitter and Reddit who raged against NFTs in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.’s sequel. The game maker, they said, was simply looking to squeeze more money out of its players. The backlash was so intense that GSC quickly reversed itself and abandoned its NFT plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “The studio was abusing its popularity,” Mr. Lantz, who lives in Ontario, said. “It’s so obviously being done for profit instead of just creating a beautiful game.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , For more than a year, crypto mania has been at a fever pitch. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared in value. Crypto-based assets like NFTs have taken off. Jack Dorsey, a Twitter founder, recently renamed one of his companies Block in honor of the blockchain, the distributed ledger system that powers digital currencies. Melania Trump has auctioned off her own NFTs. Proponents hope that blockchain will revolutionize industries, from finance to social media to art.                                                       , But to some, the crypto craze has gone too far, too fast. Skeptics argue that cryptocurrencies and related assets like NFTs are digital Ponzi schemes, with prices artificially inflated beyond their true value. Some question whether cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, which are slippery concepts, have any long-term utility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Nowhere has there been more unhappiness than in the games community, where clashes over crypto have increasingly erupted between users and major game studios like Ubisoft, Square Enix and Zynga. In many of the encounters, the gamers have prevailed — at least for now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “People are being sold buzzwords,” said Mutahar Anas, a gamer and YouTuber with three million subscribers. Those pushing NFTs in games, he said, are “trying to sell you snake oil.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , In recent months, at least half a dozen game studios have revealed plans to add NFTs to their games or said they were considering doing so. The digital assets, which are verified by blockchain technology, give proof of authenticity and ownership. That provides gamers with unique digital items, game makers said, which can enrich those that sell the NFTs in online marketplaces. Game publishers said NFTs could also potentially be transferred among games in the future, meaning items from one games franchise could affect gameplay in another., But players said they see the moves as a blatant cash grab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “I just hate that they keep finding ways to nickel-and-dime us in whatever way they can,” said Matt Kee, 22, a gamer who took to Twitter in anger this month after Square Enix, which produces one of his favorite games, Kingdom Hearts, said it was pushing into NFTs. “I don’t see anywhere mentioning how that benefits the gamer, how that improves gameplay. It’s always about, ‘How can I make money off this?’”                                                                                                                                       , Much of their resentment is rooted in the encroachment of micro transactions in video games. Over the years, game makers have found more ways to profit from users by making them pay to upgrade characters or enhance their level of play inside the games. Even if people had already paid $60 or more for a game upfront, they were asked to fork over more money for digital items like clothing or weapons for characters.                                                                                                                               , In one well-known incident in 2006, the role-playing game “The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion” charged users $2.50 for a set of armor for their character’s horse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “‘It was only a few bucks, but I remember thinking, ‘Why won’t they just give us the horse armor?’” said Eric Hild, 31, a beer brewer from Decorah, Iowa. “‘Why make us pay for it?’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Merritt K, a game streamer and editor at Fanbyte, a games industry site, said gamers’ antagonism toward the companies has built up over the last decade partly because of the growing number of micro transactions. So when game makers introduced NFTs as an additional element to buy and sell, she said, players were “primed to call this stuff out. We’ve been here before.”                                                                                                                                                                             , That has led to bursts of gamer outrage, which have rattled the game companies. In December, Sega Sammy, the maker of the Sonic the Hedgehog game, expressed reservations about its NFT and crypto plans after “negative reactions” from users. Ubisoft, which makes titles like Assassin’s Creed, said that it had misjudged how unhappy its customers would be after announcing an NFT program last month. A YouTube video about the move was disliked by more than 90 percent of viewers.                                                                  , “Maybe we under-evaluated how strong the backlash could have been,” said Nicolas Pouard, a Ubisoft vice president who heads the French company’s new blockchain initiative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Game companies said their NFT plans were not motivated by profit. Instead, they said, NFTs give fans something fun to collect and a new way for them to make money by selling the assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “It really is all about community,” said Matt Wolf, an executive at the mobile game maker Zynga, who is leading a foray into blockchain games. “We believe in giving people the opportunity to play to earn.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The rush to embrace crypto in games has gathered steam over the past few years. Some developers began building games on the blockchain, making it easy for players to collect digital assets and prove they own them. One such game was CryptoKitties, a 2017 hit where players collected digital cats, some of which sold for more than $100,000. In the pandemic, blockchain-based games like Axie Infinity, where players make money by earning and selling NFTs, also became popular.                                                                     , Bigger game studios are now trying to get in on the action, though some of their crypto plans remain vague.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Ubisoft was the first large game publisher to wade into crypto. In December, it announced an initiative known as Ubisoft Quartz, introducing three sets of NFTs in the form of digital equipment like helmets and guns. The NFTs were available for free in the shooter game Ghost Recon Breakpoint for players who had reached a certain level in the game. Gamers, the company said, could keep the items or sell them on third-party markets.                                                                                                              , So far, 10,000 digital wallets — tools that allow people to store their crypto assets — have been connected to the Quartz platform, even though Ubisoft minted just 3,000 NFTs in its first batch, Mr. Pouard said. That suggested an appetite for more NFTs in the future, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , A glossary. Cryptocurrencies have gone from a curiosity to a viable investment, making them almost impossible to ignore. If you are struggling with the terminology, let us help:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Bitcoin. A Bitcoin is a digital token that can be sent electronically from one user to another, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin is also the name of the payment network on which this form of digital currency is stored and moved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Blockchain. A blockchain is a database maintained communally, that reliably stores digital information. The original blockchain was the database on which all Bitcoin transactions were stored, but non-currency-based companies and governments are also trying to use blockchain technology to store their data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Cryptocurrencies. Since Bitcoin was first conceived in 2008, thousands of other virtual currencies, known as cryptocurrencies, have been developed. Among them are Ether, Dogecoin and Tether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Coinbase. The first major cryptocurrency company to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange, Coinbase is a platform that allows people and companies to buy and sell various digital currencies, including Bitcoin, for a transaction fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Crypto finance. The development of cryptocurrencies spawned a parallel universe of alternative financial services, known as Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, allowing crypto businesses to move into traditional banking territory, including lending and borrowing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , NFTs. A “nonfungible token,” or NFT, is an asset verified using blockchain technology, in which a network of computers records transactions and gives buyers proof of authenticity and ownership. NFTs make digital artworks unique, and therefore sellable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Ubisoft eventually plans to take a cut of sales of future NFTs, Mr. Pouard added. “We’re moving from a business model focused on just a game to a business model focused on an ecosystem in which every player can be a stakeholder,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Zynga, which is set to be acquired by Take-Two, hired Mr. Wolf, a games industry veteran, to lead a crypto effort in November. The goal was to create new games on the blockchain, making it easy for players to acquire, own and sell NFTs, Mr. Wolf said. He provided few details about how the effort would work, including whether the NFTs could be transferred between Zynga games.                                                                                                                                                                     , “We’re still developing all that,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Other game companies have waded into NFTs, echoing how crypto can generate new wealth for users. This month, Yosuke Matsuda, Square Enix’s president, wrote in an open letter that creating blockchain games would allow players to make money. That would become “a major strategic theme” for the company, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But as the number of NFT announcements from game studios piled up, players became increasingly annoyed. After users rebelled against Sega Sammy’s crypto plans, one of its executives said in a management meeting last month, “If it is perceived as simple moneymaking, I would like to make a decision not to proceed.” (The effort is continuing.)                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Other game companies have come out against crypto. Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox, told Axios in November that some games centered on earning money through NFTs appeared “exploitative” and he would avoid putting them in the Xbox store. Microsoft declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Valve, which owns the online game store Steam, also updated its rules last fall to prohibit blockchain games that allow cryptocurrencies or NFTs to be exchanged. Valve did not respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , And Tim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic Games, the maker of the game Fortnite, said his company would steer clear of NFTs in its own games because the industry is riddled with “an intractable mix of scams.” (Epic will still allow developers to sell blockchain games in its online store.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The blowback has affected more than just game studios. Discord, the messaging platform popular with gamers, backtracked in November after users threatened to cancel their paid subscriptions over a crypto initiative. Jason Citron, Discord’s chief executive, had teased the project on Twitter, prompting the mutiny.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “While I’m optimistic that there’s a lot of cool stuff going on in the blockchain space, there’s also a lot of problems,” Mr. Citron said in an interview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Kee, the gamer, said he would continue fighting game companies’ crypto efforts. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. developer’s about-face on NFTs made him hopeful that other companies could be swayed through public opinion, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “It gives me a good feeling that everyone is vocal against this,” he said. “Over the past 10 years, we’ve seen all sorts of these schemes come up, and we’re tired of it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Advertisement </td>

Mr. Kea Sokun, who is also a popular rapper, had released two songs on YouTube, and the men said they needed to know why he’d written them.                                                                                       , “They kept asking me: ‘Who is behind you?

His case is part of a crackdown in which dozens have been sent to jail for posting jokes, poems, pictures, private messages and songs on the internet.                                                 , The ramped-up scrutiny reflects an increasingly restrictive digital environment in Cambodia, where a new law will allow the authorities to monitor all web traffic in the country. Critics say that the decree puts Cambodia on a growing list of countries that have embraced China’s authoritarian model of internet surveillance, from Vietnam to Turkey, and that it will deepen the clash over the future of the web., Cambodia’s National Internet Gateway, set to begin operating on Feb. 16, will send all internet traffic — including from abroad — through a government-run portal. The gateway, which is mandatory for all service providers, gives state regulators the means to “prevent and disconnect all network connections that affect national income, security, social order, morality, culture, traditions and customs.”        , Government surveillance is already high in Cambodia. Each ministry has a team that monitors the internet. Offending content is reported to an internet crime unit in the Ministry of Interior, the center of the country’s robust security apparatus. Those responsible can be charged with incitement and sent to prison.                                                                                                , But rights groups say that the new law will make it even easier for the authorities to monitor and punish online content, and that the recent arrests are meant to further intimidate citizens into self-censorship in a country where free speech is enshrined in the Constitution.                                                                                                                                      , “The authorities are emboldened by China as an example of an authoritarian state that gives Cambodia political cover, new technology and financial resources,” said Sophal Ear, a dean at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University whose family escaped the Khmer Rouge, the murderous regime that seized power in Cambodia in 1975.                                                       , “The National Internet Gateway is merely centralizing what has been a decentralized system of control over Cambodia’s internet,” he said. “The outcome will be to crush what little remains of freedom of expression online.”                                                                                                                                                                                             , The Cambodian authorities have defended the decree as essential for peace and security, dismissing allegations of censorship or any notion that freedom of speech is under threat. “There is a free press in Cambodia and freedom on the internet,” said Phay Siphan, the chief government spokesman. “We encourage people to use the internet, up until it becomes incitement.”                                          , Mr. Phay Siphan accused rights groups of “spreading paranoia” and described United Nations experts who have criticized the law as “working part-time jobs.” He said he felt sorry for the young people who had been arrested because they were not speaking for themselves.                                                                                                                                               , “With freedom comes responsibility,” he said. “We warn them. We lecture them, make them sign documents, then the next week they post the same things, without taking the responsibility to maintain peace and stability.”                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985 and shown great zeal when publicly condemning his political rivals, appears eager to transfer his opprobrium to the digital era.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , When a former monk and activist posted a disparaging poem about the loss of the nation’s forests on the prime minister’s Facebook page, Mr. Hun Sen described the act as “extremist” and ordered the police to hunt the monk down. He was arrested in October.                                                                                                                                                            , In August, a former agriculture professor was sentenced to 18 months in prison for making jokes on Facebook about requiring chickens to wear anti-Covid masks. He was charged with incitement and with defaming the prime minister, as well as the minister of agriculture.                                                                                                                                               , Weeks later, a farmer, frustrated by the government’s failed promise to subsidize longan crops while the pandemic kept borders closed to exports, posted a video of tons of his annual harvest going to rot. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison.                                                                                                                                                                     , Of more than 30 arrests made over digital content since 2020, the most publicized one involved an autistic 16-year-old who was released in November. The teenager, Kak Sovann Chhay, had been jailed for comments he made in a chat group on Telegram, the private messaging app.                                                                                                                                         , His father, a senior member of the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party, which has been outlawed, was in prison at the same time. He had been jailed in 2020 for criticizing Mr. Hun Sen on Facebook, where the prime minister has more than 13 million followers.                                                                                                                                                  , Internet service providers have asked the authorities to provide more clarity about the gateway. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said in a statement that it had “joined with other stakeholders in sharing our feedback on this new law with the Cambodian government, and expressing our strong support for a free and open internet.”                                                                                 , Last week, three local journalists were charged and detained for incitement over a report on a land dispute that they posted on Facebook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “We’re 35 days away from D-Day, and no status update has been delivered by relevant authorities or the private sector itself. That said, we weren’t expecting any public transparency as to the implementation of this,” Naly Pilorge, director of the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, said this month.                                                                                   , “In the past, the government has tried to block content by requesting private-sector I.S.P.s to remove it, with mixed success,” she said. “But the National Internet Gateway gives them a much more powerful tool to crack down on free expression and dissent.”                                                                                                                                                          , In one bizarre move in September, the prime minister “Zoom-bombed” an online meeting for members of the Cambodian National Rescue Party. He took to Facebook to explain the intrusion: “This entry was just to give a warning message to the rebel group to be aware that Mr. Hun Sen’s people are everywhere.”                                                                                                           , San Mala, a senior advocacy officer with the Cambodian Youth Network, said activists and rights groups were already using coded language to communicate across online messaging platforms, knowing that the authorities had been emboldened by the decree.                                                                                                                                                                , “As a civil society organization, we are concerned about this internet gateway law because we fear that our work will be subjected to surveillance or our conversations will be eavesdropped on or they will be able to attend online meetings with us without invitation or permission,” said Mr. San Mala, 28.                                                                                                          , Sopheap Chak, the executive director of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, said the timing of the new law was unsettling, given upcoming elections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “There is a real risk that the National Internet Gateway will be used to block and censor dissenting opinions online,” she said. “This will hinder Cambodian citizens’ ability to make an informed decision on which candidate they deem to be the fittest to rule the country.”                                                                                                                                          , Mr. Kea Sokun, the rapper, was released in October after serving 12 months in prison. Six months of his original 18-month sentence were suspended to keep him in line, he said, a reminder that he is “not legally free yet.”                                                                                                                                                                                             , “Khmer Land,” one of the songs that got him arrested, now has more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, and Mr. Kea Sokun is already working on his next album.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “I’m not angry, but I know what happened to me is unfair,” he said. “The government made an example out of me to scare people who talk about social issues.” He said he could have had his sentence reduced if he had apologized, but he refused.                                                                                                                                                                         , “I won’t say I’m sorry,” Mr. Kea Sokun said, “and I never will.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Soth Ban and Meas Molika contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tonga: Tsunami advisories lifted in US after waves hit Pacific island following volcanic eruption - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)An underwater volcano in the South Pacific erupted violently on Saturday, causing tsunamis to hit Hawaii, Japan, and Tonga's largest island, Tongatapu -- sending waves flooding into the capital.                                                                                                                                                                     , The Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southeast of Tonga's Fonuafo'ou island, first erupted on Friday and a second time on Saturday around 5:26 p.m. local time, according to CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand (RNZ).                                                                                                                       , The eruptions sent a plume of ash, gas and steam 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) into the air, according to RNZ.

The initial wave occurred at approximately 7:40 a.m. local time, he said, bringing with it a 1 to 2-foot wave right at the peak of high tide. The largest wave came in at about 8:49 a.m. local time, prompting a surge of about 7 feet at the harbor. A subsequent surge just after 10 a.m. was "diminished." , "When it comes, it comes quickly," he said. "Not just a 1-foot wave, but it comes in a surge because it draws all the water out first, and then it comes in."                                                                                                                                                                                                                , There was some damage in the harbor and to some docks, he said. There was also "light flooding" on the beaches and up to the city's first surface street, Young said.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , All beaches and the harbor will be closed until at least noon local time, Smith said, and people were evacuated from nearby stores and the area near the harbor, though no one has been evacuated from their homes. A surf contest has been postponed and is expected to resume later Saturday.                                                                              , New Zealand on alert                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , A tsunami advisory was also issued for coastal areas on the north and east coast of New Zealand's North Island and the Chatham Islands, where "strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges at the shore" were expected, according to New Zealand's National Emergency Management Agency.                                                                            , New Zealand's official weather service said its weather stations across the country had observed "a pressure surge" on Saturday evening from the eruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Scientist Emily Lane, of New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, told the New Zealand Science Media Centre it was a "very significant" eruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The shock wave from it is clearly visible in satellite imagery and there are reports of the eruption being heard at least as far away as New Zealand," she said. "The tsunami from the eruption has reached over 2,500 kilometers being recorded on gauges over all of Aotearoa."                                                                                           , Tsunamis generated by volcanoes are much less common than tsunamis from underwater earthquakes, Lane said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A smaller eruption in late 2014 and early 2015 built up the crater of the volcano to above the surface of the water, Lane added, but it's not yet clear exactly how Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai erupted on this occasion. "When we see what is left of the island after this eruption is over we can start to put together the pieces of what happened," she said.             ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Professor Shane Cronin, from the School of Environment at the University of Auckland, told the New Zealand Science Media Centre research into historical eruptions by the same volcano suggested the current eruption episode could last for weeks or months "and further similar-sized eruptions to the 15 January 2022 event are possible."                                , "The eruption is likely to result in significant ash fall (up to 10 centimeters) in Tongatapu as well as the Ha'apai group of islands," he said. "Help will be needed to restore drinking water supplies. People of Tonga must also remain vigilant for further eruptions and especially tsunami with short notice and should avoid low-lying areas."                        , An earlier tsunami warning issued for American Samoa has since been canceled, according to the NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , There is no tsunami threat to Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from a "distant eruption," according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The volcano had been active from December 20, but was declared dormant on January 11, according to RNZ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , CNN's Dave Alsup, Jennifer Hauser, Junko Ogura, Emiko Jozuka and Haley Brink contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> China New Home Price Growth at Near 5-Year Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose by 2.6 percent year-on-year in December 2021, after a 3.0 percent gain a month earlier. This was the weakest rise in new home prices since January 2016, amid concerns about property default and tighter policies aimed at driving speculators out of the property market. Among China's biggest cities, prices increases were mainly seen in Chongqing (7.9 percent vs 8.0 percent in November), Guangzhou (5.0 percent vs 6.3 percent), Shanghai (4.0 percent vs 3.8 percent), Beijing (4.2 percent vs 5.4 percent), Shenzhen (3.3 percent vs 3.4 percent), and Tianjin (2.4 percent vs 3.0 percent). On a monthly basis, new home prices fell 0.2 percent in December, after a 0.3 percent drop in November. </td>

Those investigations are part of the China Initiative, a Justice Department effort launched during the Trump administration to crack down on Chinese economic espionage and trade secret theft. Critics of the efforts have called on the Justice Department to end its pursuit of Chinese academics., The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

On Friday, China's Foreign Ministry denied that Lee was a Chinese "agent" and said Beijing "has no need and will not engage in so-called interference activities."                                                                                                                                                   , "We urge relevant British officials to refrain from making groundless remarks or hyping up the 'China threat' theory for ulterior political purposes," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.                                                                                                                                                                       , A CNN analysis of Britain's parliamentary register, by which lawmakers record donations, shows Lee gave at least £461,000 ($639,000) to Barry Gardiner, an elected member of the opposition Labour party between 2014 and 2020, mostly through funding of his staff. Her son even worked in his office and had a parliamentary pass.                                                 , Lee also donated £5,000 ($6,800) to the leader of the Liberal Democrat party Sir Ed Davey in 2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , It is not illegal for Lee to make the donations as the UK does not yet have a foreign agents registration act like the United States, nor is it illegal for a British citizen or foreign national working in the UK to be affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Lee is listed as a British national in the UK's corporate registry.                                           , In a statement to CNN, Gardiner said he had not benefited personally from Lee's donations in any way. The money had been properly reported and its source verified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "I will continue to work closely with our security services in this and all other matters that relate to the security of our country," Gardiner said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Davey told CNN his local association had accepted the donation, that it was reported properly, and that "this was the first time he had been given cause to be concerned."                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "The government must make it a national security priority to protect the UK's democracy from threats and interference by foreign actors," Davey said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Lee's services advertised on UK government portal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The payments were made through Lee's eponymous law firm Christine Lee &amp; Co Solicitors, which since at least 2016 has been included in the directory of the "UK Advisory Network" -- a list of business services compiled by what is now the Department for International Trade to, as the directory says, "provide an accessible route" "to foreign investors setting up in the UK." , A preface to the directory says it is "facilitated by invitation from the UK government" and that "members go through a robust vetting procedure to join."                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "The Network provides a forum for feedback to the government on issues affecting the business environment and ultimately informs efforts to make the UK even more business friendly," it says.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Lee's services could still be accessed through the Department of International Trade on Friday via a government portal recently revamped to attract overseas investment for UK projects.                                                                                                                                                                                             , The advertisement for Lee's firm on the UK's great.gov website offered the first hour of legal advice for free, as did the other firms listed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , A disclaimer on the site said the department does not "endorse the character, goods, services or ability of the members of the directory" and that there is no legal relationship between the department and the service providers listed.                                                                                                                                           , The Department of International Trade said in response to CNN it had to do a "fair amount of digging" on the matter and that the great.gov.uk page was no longer live, although the site was up on the web until the close of business on Friday.                                                                                                                                    , "This case shows is an abject failure of government vetting, and shows extraordinary naivety on the part of the government when it comes to the purpose of these kinds of institutions and individuals," said Luke de Pulford of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which is pushing for tougher rules on China.                                                             , To have somebody who MI5 published an alert about "advertising their services on the government website truly is remarkable and needs to be dealt with as soon as it possibly can be," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                      , Photographed with prime ministers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Lee, a former legal adviser to China's embassy in London, has been active in political circles for 15 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , She first set up the British Chinese project in 2006 to encourage British citizens with Chinese ancestry to vote in the UK.

This facilitation was done to covertly mask the origins of the payments."                                                                                           , "This is clearly unacceptable and steps are being taken to ensure it ceases." the letter reads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Home Office launched a consultation last year on new legislation designed to shore up safeguards against hostile state action.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Dow Extends Losses As Banks Weigh </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks wavered on Friday after mixed earnings reports weighed on major banks, economic data disappointed and investors remained concerned about more aggressive Fed tightening. The Dow Jones lost around 200 points, led by falls in bank shares, the S&amp;P was 0.1% up, while the Nasdaq Composite, outperformed its peers, adding as much as 0.6% after Netflix announced a price increase for US and Canadian subscribres. On the corporate front, earnings from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo beat estimates but only because of reserve releases and Citigroup profits dropped sharply. Meanwhile, both retail sales and industrial production unexpectedly fell, raising further concerns about the omicron spread, supply disruptions and high inflation. Both the Dow and the S&amp;P extended losses for a 2nd consecutive week after falling 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq declined for a third week and traded 0.3% lower. </td>

I’ve been a finalist for three different roles, each of which has had four rounds of interviews. Each organization has asked me to draft between 15-20 pages of original responses to screening questions, hypotheticals and to develop advocacy and legal strategies. Sometimes I get the feeling I’m doing free labor as I give them all my great ideas, hoping to be hired. I understand that organizations need to evaluate what a candidate can offer, but this process is burdensome and feels inequitable as they request sophisticated work product on a short time frame without pay. Is it OK for employers to demand so much of applicants? Is there any way I can challenge this dynamic?, — Anonymous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Having to jump through an excessive number of hoops to get a job can be incredibly frustrating. It seems like the interviewing process is getting more and more convoluted in many industries. And there are employers out there who are exploitative, essentially demanding unpaid labor from job candidates and they get away with it because they can. Some employers will offer compensation for work product expected during the vetting process, but they are few and far between.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , This is a challenging problem because, as you note, employers do need to find ways of determining if a given candidate will be a good fit. A new hire, especially for a senior position, is a significant investment of resources; hiring the wrong person only increases that investment. While some things can be learned from a series of interviews, there are criteria that can be assessed only through work product. Within reason, it is acceptable for an employer to make requests of potential hires. The limits of that reason are quite subjective, unfortunately.                                                                                                                                                                                      , I really empathize with your frustrations — so much work with no guarantee of success. Employers hold all the cards, or they did, until the Great Resignation began. You may, perhaps, challenge this dynamic by asking if there is compensation for the work being asked of you but that is risky. I do hope, in time, that employers find a more reasonable way of vetting potential hires and I wish you the very best in your job search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , I work for a legal services nonprofit making the transition to the new world of the cloud, video meetings, etc. It feels like a constant battle between the younger people and the more seasoned employees — constant sniping, each calling the other lazy and entitled. As someone who is in the middle of those groups, a geriatric millennial, I am constantly in the middle. I hear the bitching from both sides and make an effort to help each side understand the other’s perspective. Both sides have some good points and both sides are wrong about some stuff. The leadership is barely keeping the place running and really has completely abdicated any culture-creating or policy-setting role. That leaves people like me to sort it out.             , Do you have any suggestions for how to get the two sides to talk to each other in productive ways? The issues aren’t just related to Zoom meetings and Dropbox accounts but cultural shifts as well. I genuinely believe everyone is trying. I have thought about trying to set up a mentorship system to pair people together? Or (when possible) planning more social events? Maybe there are specific resources you would recommend?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , — Anonymous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Honestly, you should tell these people to grow up — this is ridiculous. Yes, change is hard, but it is inevitable. Technology and the ways we use it in the workplace are always evolving. The culture we are a part of shifts, sometimes faster than we can manage but it shifts nonetheless. We don’t have to like it, but we do need to adapt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , At the same time, there is a lot to be learned from older ways of working and thinking and being. It’s just lazy for people to shout derivative generational barbs at one another. To what end? It might feel good in the moment but it only creates a more divisive atmosphere among people with whom we are supposed to be in community. Tell your colleagues this is unacceptable on all sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , If everyone is genuinely trying, they need to try harder. The mentorship program sounds like a great idea. Frame it as a two-way mentorship system, so everyone understands they have something to offer. I don’t think that mandatory fun will solve this problem, but mandatory maturity might.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , I recently had the opportunity to bring three provisional junior members into my team, with the option to progress them to permanent roles after a year if I can demonstrate their importance to the business. Depending on budget, there might be room for only one or two to progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , I’m assessing them on their productivity as well as contributions in other areas. All three are hard workers with great attitudes and high productivity, and I’m currently building business cases to keep each on board permanently. I’ve also received unsolicited praise from three senior managers for one of them in particular — who happens to resemble a young Michelle Pfeiffer. These individuals are all older straight men, which is unfortunately the main demographic here at the upper levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Michelle” has in no way behaved unprofessionally — she’s made strong professional connections across demographics — but I’d be remiss in ignoring my suspicions that these men were at least subconsciously motivated by more than professional respect. It feels unfair to the other two junior staffers to offer this praise the weighting it would normally merit but unfair to Michelle to ignore it. Help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , — Anonymous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Be careful. You’re essentially engaging in the same type of behavior you rightly disdain from your older straight male colleagues. Are you really suggesting that you might penalize your employee because you assume she is receiving positive professional feedback because of her appearance?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , People have biases, particularly where looks are concerned. My mother loves to remind me that we eat with our eyes first. This is something of a mixed metaphor but I think you get my point. Entire books have been written about the advantages beautiful people enjoy in the workplace. I appreciate your being mindful of this dynamic, but if Michelle is indeed performing well that’s what you should focus on. To compensate based on what you perceive as unfair praise is a slippery slope to head down. You absolutely mean well but you have no way of knowing if the men praising her performance are really only praising her looks.                                                                                                                   , Is it possible? Of course. But it’s not fair to punish her for their childish misogyny, if that’s truly what’s going on. All three candidates deserve to be treated equitably. Don’t overthink this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Earlier this year, I went on a few dates with a guy I liked and thought things were good until he ghosted me. I accepted that he wasn’t that into me and moved on, though I was hurt by the lack of communication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Fast forward six months: he’s introduced as my new co-worker. He had known I worked at this small restaurant and even said, “Hey, I’m glad you still work here!” I honestly don’t mind that he works there. I’m happy to help him when he asks work-related questions. However, he often tries to talk as if we’re friends and has not addressed our past or the fact that he ghosted me. How do I tell him I was hurt when he ghosted me and that I wish to only discuss work matters?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , — Anonymous, Washington                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Being ghosted feels terrible. Without warning someone disappears and you have no answers. In some ways, this is a fortuitous situation. You have been presented with an opportunity for closure. If you really do want to address this with the Ghost, ask him if you can speak before or after work in a neutral location. Share your feelings and the terms you would prefer for your relationship moving forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But before you do that, I want you to really think through what you’re hoping to get out of such a conversation. What good will come of it both in the short and long term? You will unburden some of your hurt, but it might complicate what seems like an amicable professional relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Do consider letting this go, not because he deserves to be let off the hook but because you seem to be in a good place and he doesn’t deserve any more of your mental energy. In the meantime, may the next guy you date be the man of your dreams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Roxane Gay is the author, most recently, of “Hunger” and a contributing opinion writer.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , In this article                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Banks have been one of the main beneficiaries of high inflation recently because their profit margins tend to expand when higher prices force central banks to raise interest rates.                                                                                                                                                                            , At least, that was the thinking as investors bid up bank shares while rates climbed and inflation reached multi-decade highs. Now, megabanks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are disclosing that hot inflation in one area — employee wages — is casting a shadow over the next few years.                                                               , Shares of JPMorgan fell more than 6% on Friday after the bank said that expenses will climb 8% to roughly $77 billion this year, driven by wage inflation and technology investments. Higher expenses will likely push the bank's returns in 2022 and 2023 below recent results and the lender's 17% return-on-capital target, according to CFO Jeremy Barnum.  , "We've seen a somewhat elevated attrition and a very dynamic labor market, as the rest of the economy is seeing," Barnum said. "It is true that labor markets are tight, that there's a little bit of labor inflation, and it's important for us to attract and retain the best talent and pay competitively."                                                  , The development adds nuance to the bull case for owning banks, which typically outperform other sectors in rising-rate environments. While economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates three or four times this year, boosting the finance industry, there is the risk that runaway inflation could actually wipe out those gains, according to Barnum., "On balance, a modest inflation that leads to higher rates is good for us," the CFO told analysts in a conference call. "But under some scenarios, elevated inflationary pressures on expenses could more than offset the rates benefit."                                                                                                                       , Citigroup CFO Mark Mason said Friday that there was a "lot of competitive pressure on wages" as banks jostle for talent amid the boom in deals and trading activity.                                                                                                                                                                                            , "We have seen some pressure in what one has to pay to attract talent," Mason said. "You've even seen it at some of the lower levels, I should say entry levels in the organization."                                                                                                                                                                            , At JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, it is the bank's professional class in particular — trading personnel, investment bankers and asset management employees — who have seen pay swell after two straight years of strong performance. The company also raised wages at branches last year.                                                           , "There's a lot more compensation for top bankers and traders and managers who I should say did an extraordinary job in the last couple years," chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts during a conference call.  "We will be competitive in pay. If that squeezes margins a little bit for shareholders, so be it."                                         , Dimon said that while overall inflation would "hopefully" start to recede this year as the Fed gets to work, increases in "wages, and housing and oil are not transitory, they'll stay elevated for a while."                                                                                                                                                   , In fact, Dimon told analysts that wage inflation would be a recurring theme among corporations this year. Some companies will navigate the change better than others, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                  , "Please don't say I'm complaining about wages; I think wages going up is a good thing for the people who have the wages going up," Dimon said.

Under the expansion, low- and middle-income parents could receive up to $3,000 for every child ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for every child under age 6. The payments were income-based and began to phase out for individuals earning more than $75,000 and married couples earning more than $150,000., IRS TO DELIVER FINAL CHILD TAX CREDIT PAYMENT OF 2021 TO 36M FAMILIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The first half was delivered in monthly payments from July to December with $300 for children under the age of six and $250 for those ages 6 to 17, but the last check was mailed out last month. The second half will be delivered as a lump sum when families file their 2021 tax returns in the spring. The IRS said that 36 million families received the payments each month, or about 60 million children.                                          , Without the enhanced tax credit, an estimated 10 million children are at risk of falling below the poverty line, according to an analysis from the progressive think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Rochelle Wilcox delivers cartons of milk to the two-year-olds' classroom, as teacher Steneisha Morehead sits at left, with student Andrew Robair III, Amore Smalls, Roemello Jones, and King Adams, at Wilcox's Academy of Early Learning in New Orleans,  (REUTERS/Kathleen Flynn / Reuters)                                                                                                                                                             , The expiration of the child tax credit could hurt Democrats' odds ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, as the lawmakers viewed the more generous version of the child tax credit as a centerpiece of their campaign platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Although President Biden and most congressional Democrats hoped to extend the boosted program for at least another year with the passage of the $1.7 trillion Build Back Better plan, momentum for the massive social spending and climate bill crumbled after moderate Sen.

"From an energy standpoint, this could be a seismic event," said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group. Russia is not only a major oil producer but Europe, in their rush to get off of fossil fuels, has "become more dependent on Russia as major source for their energy."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures fall for the session, gain for the week - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures declined on Friday, giving up earlier gains, but holding onto a climb for the week. Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at SIA Wealth Management, attributed the day's pullback in prices partly to profit-taking ahead of the long weekend, with regular trading closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. However, a decline in the U.S. dollar for the week and gold's long-term role as an inflation hedge are among the reasons behind the precious metal's rise this week, he said. February gold

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The euro weakened to near $1.14 on Friday, after hitting its highest level since mid-November, amid higher US Treasury yields and a rebound in the dollar. Concerns over imminent policy tightening in the US resurfaced after several Federal Reserve officials signaled they were prepared to hike interest rates in March to combat inflation. Although Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell dashed expectations of a more aggressive tightening in Congressional testimony earlier this week. Also, the December US consumer price index rose at the fastest pace in nearly four decades but it came in line with expectations and has largely been priced in by the markets. Still, the European Central Bank is seen slower than other major central banks in tightening monetary policy, after announcing in December a reduction in the pace of its asset purchases while signaling interest rates will be kept at record-low levels for some time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks traded lower on Friday after mixed earnings reports weighed on major banks, economic data disappointed and investors remained concerned about more aggressive Fed tightening. The Dow Jones lost more than 400 points, led by falls in bank shares, the S&amp;P erased 0.7% and Nasdaq Composite was down as much as 0.5%. On the corporate front, earnings from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo beat estimates but only because of reserve releases and  Citigroup profits dropped sharply. Meanwhile, both retail sales and industrial production unexpectedly fell, raising further concerns about the omicron spread, supply disruptions and high inflation. Both the Dow and the S&amp;P are on track for their second straight week of losses, while the Nasdaq is set to decline for a third week. </td>

An increase in inventories adds to gross domestic product and is usually a sign of an expanding economy. The ratio of inventories to sales, meanwhile, rose to 1.25 from 1.24.

        SIRI,
        -2.83%
       slid 3.8% toward a six-week low in morning trading Friday, after J.P. Morgan analyst Sebastiano Petti turned bullish on the satellite radio company, amid continued weakness in U.S. auto sales as semiconductor shortages and supply chain issues crimp supply. The stock is on track to snap a six-day win streak, which would be the longest such streak in 10 months. Petti cut the stock's rating to underweight from neutral, and lowered the price target to $6 from $7. "We expect [Sirius'] initial 2022 self-pay net add guide to reflect a higher-than-usual level of conservatism given the uncertain new auto sales environment as the auto industry continues to work through chip shortages and other supply chain issues," Petti wrote in a note to clients. The slower-growth outlook led him to lower his 2022 estimate for free cash flow, which also suggests reduced share repurchases. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 1. While an expected announcement of a special dividend, which he expects to be 25 cents a share, could improve investor sentiment, "a slower buyback pace is likely to weigh on shares."

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The University of Michigan consumer sentiment for the US fell to 68.8 in January of 2022, the second lowest level in a decade and below market forecasts of 70, mainly due to the spread of the delta and omicron coronavirus variants and escalating inflation, preliminary estimates showed. Three-quarters of consumers in early January ranked inflation, compared with unemployment, as the more serious problem facing the nation. Also, confidence in government economic policies is at its lowest level since 2014. The economic conditions subindex went down to 73.2 from 74.2 in December and the expectations gauge dropped to 65.9 from 68.3. Meanwhile, inflation expectations increased for both the year ahead (4.9% vs 4.8%) and the next 5 years (3.1% vs 2.9%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Australian Dollar Erases Gains on Friday </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Australian dollar slipped 0.5% to around $0.724 on Friday, retreating from an 8-week high of $0.731 hit in the previous session, as the greenback recouped some earlier losses and the spread of omicron threatens to slow the momentum of the economic recovery. Australia has reported roughly 1,132 thousand infections so far in 2022 amid a series of record-breaking daily tolls, while its most populous state, New South Wales, is seeing unprecedented numbers of COVID-19 deaths. On top of that, businesses are struggling to stay open amid quarantine-related labor shortages and as customers become more cautious to attend social activities. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia has repeatedly insisted that a hike in domestic rates is not likely until 2023, or until inflation pushes sustainably within its 2-3% target range, and is already lagging behind other major central banks in dialing back pandemic-era stimulus. For the week, the Aussie is still set for a 0.7% gain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Industrial Output Sees Surprise Fall </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Industrial production in the United States went down 0.1 percent from a month earlier in December of 2021, after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent increase in November and compared to market expectations of a 0.3 percent increase. Manufacturing production declined 0.3 percent and motor vehicles and parts stepped down 1.3 percent. Excluding the motor vehicle sector, factory output dipped 0.2 percent, with similarly sized decreases for durables and nondurables. Within durables, miscellaneous manufacturing recorded the largest decrease (2.7 percent), while wood products (1.2 percent) and nonmetallic mineral products (1.5 percent) posted the largest increases. Within nondurables, chemicals posted the largest gain (0.7 percent), but most other sub categories recorded losses of between 1 and 2 percent.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Futures Fall on Big Bank Earnings </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US futures extended losses on Friday, with contracts on the Dow Jones futures sinking more than 300 points and both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq losing almost 1% as investors turn their attention to mixed earnings reports from big banks while concerns of a more aggressive Fed tightening lingered after comments from several officials including Fed Governor Lael Brainard showed a reduction in inflation is the Fed’s “most important task”. On the corporate front, earnings from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo beat estimates but the results were helped by reserve releases. Also, profits from Citigroup dropped sharply. Meanwhile, retail sales in the US unexpectedly slumped 1.9% in December as holiday shopping was pushed to early in the year amid supply chain and inflation worries. On the week, both the Dow (-0.3%) and the S&amp;P (-0.4%) are on track for their second straight week of losses, while the Nasdaq (-0.9%) is set to decline for a third week. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Indian rupee weakened to a 1-week low of around 74.1, tracking subdued domestic equities and as investors digest fresh economic data including a wider trade deficit, a slightly higher than expected wholesale inflation reading and slowing industrial output growth. Meanwhile, the World bank retained India’s growth forecast at 8.3% for FY22, while raising it to 8.7% for FY23 from its earlier prediction of 7.5% amid revival in the private capital expenditure cycle. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US retail sales sank 1.9% mom in December, the biggest decline since February of 2021, and ending 4 straight months of strong growth amid rising omicron infections, a surge in inflation and as a large share of holiday shopping was pushed to earlier months on expectations of shipping delays. Figures compare with market forecasts of a flat reading. Biggest declines were seen in nonstore retailers (-8.7%), furniture stores (-5.5%), sporting goods (-4.3%), clothing (-3.1%), electronics (-2.9%) and general merchandise stores (-1.5%). A fall was also seen in sales at food services and drinking places (-0.8%), gasoline stations (-0.7%), food and beverages stores (-0.5%) and auto dealers (-0.4%). Year-on-year, retail sales increased 16.9% however, as historically high price increases continue to weigh. </td>

Over the last 50 trading days, when compared to the S&amp;amp;P 500, the stock has performed in line with the market. The MACD-LT is indicating that the intermediate-term trend is bearish at this time. If the stock closes below $4613.0 a change in trend will be confirmed. Upside momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI, is negative. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days, indicating that ES_F under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is currently above a falling 50-day moving average. A move below this average would be confirmation that the trend is changing. ES_F could find secondary support at its rising 200-day moving average.

Hey Hedge funds, your desk traders suck. My goal is to 5x my paper trading account and at least 50% this year trading overall. I’m confident I can beat the market with my trading strategies this year. </td>

How much? Well, when do we get a handle on inflation and will the consumer stop spending despite having $2.5 TRILLION in their pockets and credit card spending at an alarming rate, 100% over consensus last US Consumer credit report, spent $40 BILLION instead of est. $20B😱👌

In short order too, inflation will get wild soon, this isn&amp;#39;t some year or two off stuff, it is NOW. 

Inflation doesn&amp;#39;t wait at this level, from 6.4% Oct. , 6.8% Nov. to 7% Dec. can easily--and will easily--go to whole point, or, 2 increments now as oil, food, car, even, house buying crazily moves the needle uP.

Oil will likely continue to move higher (to triple digits...we are stuck in a vicious cycle of a broken supply chain and rising prices coupled with lack of investment in oil industry and rising demand). Higher oil prices will lead to even higher inflation which will lead to a major recession. 
 
$CYTH will be fine in my view. $SPY will correct in a major way. $QQQ will take a major haircut as well.

Recent data points suggest inflation and the economy is cooling off.  Fed tightening may not need to be as aggressive as once thought. If this cooling trend continues then the risk end of the asset curve may be severely underpriced.

* Retail sales down 1.9%
* Last 3 monthly inflation readings / decking trend:

-Oct: .9 increase.
-Nov: .8 increase.
-Dec: .5 increase.

* Consumer sentiment: 68.8 down from December by 2.6%.

So Biden shotgunning out 500 M (or 1 B—I’ve seen both reported) at-home Covid test kits at a cost of God knows.  That’s great, except my company and probably most don’t accept the do-it-yourself home kit test results.  If you have Covid symptoms you are required to get a negative PCR test before you return to the office.  This seems like just another desperate ploy to convince Americans that government is “doing something.” </td>

That&amp;#39;s logical, markets might actually like it, I&amp;#39;m actually methodically doing things so FED has Feb. to unbalance markets so they are then balanced accordingly for most historic rate hike in the history of our country.

Oh, btw, by March 1, inflation will already be 10-11%😱👌🙋‍♂️🔥🚨 And, to think, Brainerd just told us this week the goal is to be back to FED funds rate 🎯 of 2% by end of 2020😅😂

Plus, what this tells us, folks, is Brainerd HEARD this goal from Powell, she&amp;#39;s not about to talk w/o 1st approval from horse&amp;#39;s mouth👍 </td>

And then, how many years of licks does it take to bring it down from peak? 

Let&amp;#39;s throw a number out there for peak, 24%.

Don&amp;#39;t laugh. 2.5 TRILLION OF HOUSEHOLD WEALTH OUT THERE NOW, and, that was last month, the Wage Inflation &amp;amp; cc spend just continues to grow. Did u see that December retail report released Friday, -1.9%, yet, get this, consumers spent $40 BILLION ON CREDIT CARDS THE MONTH OF DECEMBER!! 😱

Inflation is going to R.I.P. our necks off very soon UNLESS the FED takes drastic measures to stop it.

Remember, 1970s, inflation raged 5% to 12% and S&amp;amp;P 500 stagnant, growing BELOW inflation.....

Now, valuations for toys, food, computers, flowers, you name it, MUCH HIGHER. 

What I&amp;#39;m trying to say with latter is we have no choice but seeing a peak of 24% inflation in few years. Yes, I DOUBLED the 70s peak inflation #, per values then vs. now </td>

Alexa, hello, please, turn on Christian music, find me recipe this morning for satay please.

&amp;quot;Good morning, Mr. Inflation, sir. Music on. Here&amp;#39;s a recipe for satay, an indian dish, sir. And, I recommend adding eggs since it&amp;#39;s the am.&amp;quot;

Alexa, great idea, I need to go to the store for ingredients &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;m curious what the price difference is for August 2021 vs now.

&amp;quot;Sir, August &amp;#39;21, these satay ingredients, for four people dish, cost 16 dollars and fifty-two cents: dozen AA eggs, 2 lb. boneless chicken, curry packet, brown sugar, coconut flakes, 2 limes, 1 quart milk.&amp;quot;

And, now? 

&amp;quot;Yes, I&amp;#39;m getting to that, Mr. Inflation, sir. $21.93. However, the only store of the three in your area to have chicken left, per inventory online, is Safeway, but it is 5 lbs. so if you hurry--OK, as I speak, Mr. Inflation, sir,  a new person is in line getting 4.5 pounds of chicken. Can you do satay for breakfast another day, sir, or, for one this am?&amp;quot; </td>

I have a few suggestions on how this can be accomplished.

(1.) Upper House needs to form an unemployment task force of Big 6 Senators (CA,TX,NY, FL, IL, &amp;amp; PA)
(2.) These Senators will work with Fed Chair Powell and the respective Fed Bank Presidents in their District. 
(3.) THey will bring in Business Leaders in their respective States and look at the composition of Unemployed individuals and work across party lines to make sure these individuals find employment before the end of 2022. 

Given the composition of the Unemployed in these States it is of the utmost importance we get a working group of these Senators, Fed Chair, Respective Fed Bank Presidents in the Region, Governors from these States, and Business Leaders to ALL WORK TOGETHER to SOLVE this issue $SPY $DIA $QQQ $VIX </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ A lot of people are thinking about 1979 and the 1980’s.  This isn’t anything like then.  Inflation may be high, but it is due to the supply shock from a pandemic and subsequent resumption of stopped commerce.  It is not because there are subsidies being lifted, but because there is more money than supplies.  Jobs aren’t low, they’re at all time high availability.  Businesses are not filing bankruptcies and doing worse, they’re all the survivors of a pandemic with no strong competitors!  The markets are still undervalued and all these people who have been saying it is overvalued have been wrong and will stay wrong until the next REAL CRISIS! </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY You guys sure milling lotto posts tonight but, let&amp;#39;s be honest, headed toward charted waters in a-hurry now.

That is dangerous, do you know real reason Titanic sank? Speed changed, tried to make it  England to New York a day faster than normal.

So, when the iceberg presented itself to crow&amp;#39;s nest, they screamed for captain to turn but the speed, ultimately, was too fast and they hit an iceberg.

Now how&amp;#39;s this an analogy for markets? 

Well, Titanic is market &amp;amp; Powell and FED sees the iceberg which is inflation, but they chose to wait too long to change course w/ quantitative easing and so they are now MAYBE turning rudder 26th meeting.

Late. Our economy unable now to stave off inflation; household wealth 2.5 TRILLION &amp;amp; consumers not quit spending. Spend self to death.

NOTHING can slow  &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot; down, we WILL hit!!

And start to sink. What will FED do DIFFERENT than what happened to Titanic VERY important after HIT!

God help us!

Tech MOST DANGER when economy sinks

Well, analysts figured out Jensen blowing smoke about metaverse, even, GPUs future REVENUE as until there&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;next big thang&amp;#39; tech products that actually can USE 5 GPUs or CPUs then it&amp;#39;s stagnant, dormant technology, and not even S/W developed so it&amp;#39;s still experimental stage too. knowing who will power the Next Big Thang.

Facebook, too, all this talk about the metaverse for it and we&amp;#39;re YEARS away. 

Take the under.

I&amp;#39;m going to go get the tri-tip and salad and kombucha ready for the big futeball games soon.

1 equity research analyst has issued a  HOLD recommendation;

The average 1-year PRICE TARGET among brokerages that have updated their coverage on the stock in the last year is $31.80.

Since 4 Novembre 2021 there was a significant drop in GROWTH and GREEN ENERGY STOCKS. Now, in my opinion, the decline is over, a new uptrend is coming that will continue during IQ driven by:
- new press releases/announcement of reaching important milestones (debt refinancing, biogas, start of India production);
- beat of estimate for IVQ 2021 Results in the March CC. In IVQ 2021 margins were high thanks to the rise of ethanol price and decline of corn.

Market is not evaluating it. It values the leader company in CO2 reduction in California $350 Mln Equity Value and $600Mln Enterprise Value that is really a bargain

The NFL licensing agreements are essentially all taken until 2033, and the only player small enough to acquire would be $FOXA or Viacom. Other sports are a huge step down, and again most licensing rights are already held by major broadcasting. Seems like it will be a acquisition based strategy to acquire sports content.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $VERB This could be huge. 
David Meltzer &amp;amp; Rory have been hinting about shoppable programing on the 2 minute Drill show where Meltzer is the host &amp;amp; Rory is a judge. Now the background &amp;amp; a few events.

David Meltzer is best buddies with Rory, Verb&amp;#39;s CEO. They&amp;#39;re on a streaming show together that the 1st 2 seasons were on $AMZN , &amp;amp; bloomberg tv &amp;amp; the 3rd season will air on amzn, bloomberg tv &amp;amp;  Verbtv. However the show will only be shoppable thru verbtv. On top of that David Meltzer signs a contract w/Apple to work with their Apple tv. One big piece of that puzzle is Verbs&amp;#39;s board member is Apple&amp;#39;s long time General Counsel Nancy Heinen hired by Steve Jobs &amp;amp; very good friends with Tim Cook.

Then Meltzer tweets this something Big is Coming.
That could mean anything but omg imagine a program soon using verbtech for streaming shoppabilty. When does Meltzer start with $AAPL </td>

This stock is trending upwards based on its moving average and is performing perfectly in line with market performance levels but not outperforming it 
 
I&amp;#39;m rating this stock a 7/10 based on its current situation😊  
 
The Positive Sentiment Price level is between $14638-$17566  
 
For me, a short/long term Sell target for active traders from the current price would be between $19034-$20493  
 
One year ago from today, $AAPL was trading at $12891 so at the current price, $AAPL is up 3423%!

Will Lucid Make the Apple Car?
It’s never a dull moment in the electric vehicle sector is it? To close out the week the rumor mill was in full effect as an article posted on the site TorqueNews.com sent investors into a frenzy. The article, which at this point is pure hearsay and is more of an opinion than fact, opined of a potential partnership between Lucid Group ($42.22|1.96%) and Apple ($173.07|0.51%). The long-awaited announcement for Apple’s choice to make its new Apple Car, will be made later in 2022 according to the tech giant. At least one writer believes Lucid has a fighting chance at it.

That’s my call on how the top five will shake out, in that order, by 2027.  
  
The demographic shift is going to have an impact; retirement aged folks are not into Netflix and are finally cutting their cable/dish and turning to streaming.    
 
In the end, good content will win.  People with money will pay for good content. I think Apple thoroughly understands the value of quality; that plus their ecosystem is going to be powerful, although their current  app needs work. 
 
Netflix, on the other hand, has taken a quantity approach. A sea of cheap trash. Warner-Discovery and Viacom have quality. Amazon is somewhere in betwern but doesn seem to be prioritizing video.   
 
Netflix will eventually become the AOL of streaming. </td>

The bear thesis generally seems to be that bakkt haven’t released PR to counter the massive shorting which brought the company from its recent all time high to where it is today. This is some serious nonsense The refuse to acknowledge the value in the partnerships being developed (I presume as we speak) And indicated by the mass hiring program going on - there is a potential MOASS approaching which could easily be triggered by its parent, the owner of the NYSE - So anyone right now holding a short - you may wish these points over this long weekend, and just hope the company don’t decide to annihilate your entire wealth with a PR between now and Tuesday when the market reopens. The $AAPL partnership has been mentioned in previous PR - what makes you think this won’t happen - the staff hiring program indicates it will </td>

This is very lucrative.. look at the AAPL stock is reasonably cheap. Good for investing for longer term like 3 to 5 years.

A sell-off occurs when a large volume of securities are sold in a short period of time, causing the price of a security to fall in rapid succession. As more shares are offered than buyers are willing to accept, the decline in price may accelerate as market psychology turns pessimistic. $tsla   $aapl    $f    $GE    $ccl   🐻❤😈✔ </td>

Christ almighty (and He is almighty), but what the flip was FED Brainerd thinking when said, &amp;quot;we will get back to FED funds target rate by end of 2022&amp;quot; ?

THAT is what scared the eek out of markets yesterday and, really, it should have been continuation today.
Someone said, &amp;quot;bull trap,&amp;quot; because we ticked 459  to complete diamond pattern before zipping up.

So yeah, gap secured, now what? 

Well, at risk of repeating myself, I think 2018 mirrors this market in 2021 perfectly, FOR SAME TYPE MONSTER DROP, with AMD ER day merely as timeline , Oct. 26, &amp;#39;18, having a decent ER, but tech dropped 600 on the day and DOW over 1000. 
S&amp;amp;P, of course, a radical # too. AMD SUNk.
Now all the insane 2-month volatility following AMD ER led to sev 3 to 5% days&amp;#39; in markets w/ culmination of a RECESSION only 0.25% away on Dec. 21, 2018, technical recession, a 25% S&amp;amp;P drop.

So, yes, a bear market like that en route w/ inflation 7% (and climbing fast), Wage Inflation compounds + rates </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA out of curiosity, has there been talks yet?

The model S and model X have been around for almost a decade now. Most legacy automakers have a new generation ever 5-6 years.  When will they revamp the a new body?

I know model S got a new dashboard, but that&amp;#39;s not really a major change.

I understand that sales have not slumped, the demand is still high.  I get that you don&amp;#39;t fix what&amp;#39;s not broke.  You also don&amp;#39;t put a new model every year like apple ether.  

I really don&amp;#39;t like the look of most there vehicles. I also don&amp;#39;t like the color choice.  It would have to be white as that is the only one that is acceptable to my tastes. I want fun color like orange or lime green, a light shade or blue, candy red.

 To be honest I think KIA and Hyundai did really good with there upcoming  EV SUVs.

 Unless Tesla 2nd gen comes out before I need a new car. I&amp;#39;m leaning that way.

Thoughts? </td>

 Super Awesome Mega Space etf update 1/16/22  
🚀🛰🛸👽🌎🌜🪐💎👐  
- selling 90% of my VORB at 11 was definitely the right move. There are way better Space industry investments at a stupidly low price now. What will be the next Space stock to double? PL seems to have some momentum right now. A double off its low at 4.95 is only a move back to nearly 10. High for PL was 12.15 in Nov and PL will for sure be added to the UFO etf on June rebalancing which will bring further buying pressure and price support. The fact that Cathie Wood has not yet added PL and the others to ARKX further proves how insane she is. Imagine running a Space etf but you don&amp;#39;t own PL, the largest Earth Observation constellation with 240 satellites in orbit right now 
- RDW er will come soon and I think once all of that uncertainty is gone it easily doubles and triples from this crazy low price 
- RKLB should be at 30 RIGHT NOW.  
- ASTR should double after next successful launch this week. </td>

Here’s some Calculations WS is ignoring and not factoring into current SP:  

-FSD —— ——————-12k
-Take Rate ——————18%
-Operating margins—- 95% 
-Cars sold 2025 ——— 5M 
-P/E ————————— 50 
-10YR Yield —————- 2%
Discount Rate ————10%

If we do the math as FSD stand alone business how much should be valued at and how mush should add $$ to current stock price ! 

(See Spreadsheet) FSD is valued at $308 2022! 

 $1793 (Auto)+ $308 (FSD)= $2100
PT for 2022 coming from only two business Auto + FSD ! 

Standby for more math adding  Insurance &amp;amp; Energy to get to the true value !

This incredible undervalued!!

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA Why P/E ratios are silly for growth stocks...

Two companies have identical P/E ratios.  Same revenue.  Same price.  Same expenses.  
But a closer look reveals that company A having the same expenses as company B, was spending half as much to stay in business.  The other half of their expenses was spending they didn&amp;#39;t have to make.  They spent that on expansion and optimization and serving debt early... All things that they could have not spent if they wanted to...   but ALL of company B&amp;#39;s expenses were obligations to stay afloat.

One of these companies is worth many times the worth of the other.

If it isn&amp;#39;t obvious to you which one, then stock investing isn&amp;#39;t for you. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $ARKK I actually like ARKKs top holdings. the issue was valuation. $SQ was over 100B valuation at its peak, TDOC close to 40B with zero profit and none anytime soon. Heck even $TSLA makes no sense to me still. good companies, terrible valuations. Question is whether to be long and when to enter and average down. </td>
