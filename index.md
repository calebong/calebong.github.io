   <td style="text-align:left;"> Crisis-hit Sri Lanka asks China to restructure its debt </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The president of crisis-hit Sri Lanka has asked China to restructure its debt repayments as part of efforts to help the South Asian country navigate its worsening financial situation.                                                                          , Gotabaya Rajapaksa made the request during a meeting with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Sunday.                                                                                                                                                            , In the last decade China has lent Sri Lanka over $5bn (£3.7bn) for projects including roads, an airport and ports.                                                                                                                                               , But critics say the money was used for unnecessary schemes with low returns.                                                                                                                                                                                     , "The president pointed out that it would be a great relief to the country if attention could be paid on restructuring the debt repayments as a solution to the economic crisis that has arisen in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic," Mr Rajapaksa's office said., The statement also said China was asked to provide "concessional" terms for its exports to Sri Lanka, which amounted to around $3.5bn last year, without providing further details.                                                                              , Mr Rajapaksa also offered to allow Chinese tourists to return to Sri Lanka provided they adhere to strict coronavirus regulations.                                                                                                                               , Before the pandemic China was Sri Lanka's main source of tourists and it imports more goods from China than from any other country.                                                                                                                              , In recent months, Sri Lanka has been experiencing a severe debt and foreign exchange crisis, which has been made worse by the loss of tourist income during the pandemic.                                                                                        , China is Sri Lanka's fourth biggest lender, behind international financial markets, the Asian Development Bank and Japan.                                                                                                                                        , The country has received billions of dollars of soft loans from China but the island nation has been engulfed in a foreign exchange crisis which some analysts have said has pushed it to the verge of default.                                                  , Sri Lanka has to repay about $4.5bn in debt this year starting with a $500m international sovereign bond, which matures on 18 January.                                                                                                                           , The country's central bank has repeatedly assured investors that all of its debt repayments will be met and said funds for this month's bond repayment has already been allocated.                                                                               , Sri Lanka is a key part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, a long-term plan to fund and build infrastructure linking China to the rest of the world.                                                                                                           , However, some countries, including the US, have labelled the project a "debt trap" for smaller and poorer nations.                                                                                                                                               , Beijing has always rejected those accusations, and in response has accused some in the West of promoting this narrative to tarnish its image.                                                                                                                    , Last month a Sri Lankan government minister said the country planned to settle a debt for past oil imports from Iran by paying it off in tea.                                                                                                                    , It plans to send $5m worth of tea to Iran each month to clear a $251m debt.                                                                                                                                                                                      , In September, Sri Lanka declared an economic emergency, after a steep fall in the value of its currency, the rupee, caused a spike in food prices.                                                                                                               , Authorities said they would take control of the supply of basic food items, including rice and sugar, and set prices in an attempt to control rising inflation.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Shanghai Composite fell 0.1% while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.15% early on Monday, with losses in consumer, transportation and industrial stocks offsetting gains in technology and healthcare firms, as mainland stocks remained under pressure from the country’s zero-tolerance Covid strategy in the run-up to the Lunar New Year and WInter Olympics. Authorities in the Chinese port city of TIanjin said they began a city-wide testing campaign of its 14 million residents after a cluster of 20 children and adults tested positive for Covid, including two with the omicron variant. China’s approach of responding to small numbers of cases with mass testing and tight lockdowns contrasted with other countries, which have opened up following vaccination campaigns. The market laggards include Cosco Shipping (-4%), Power Construction (-3.9%) and China Tourism (-4.1%), while some gainers were Andon Health (3.9%), Shijiazhuang Yilin (4.5%) and China Greatwall (8.5%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Bob Saget, the comedian and actor arguably known best by audiences as wholesome patriarch Danny Tanner on the sitcom "Full House," has died, according to a statement from the Orange County Sheriff's Office in Orlando, Florida.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , He was 65.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "Earlier today, deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes for a call about an unresponsive man in a hotel room.

According to tour dates pinned to his Twitter account, he performed Saturday night at Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , He tweeted after the show, "Loved tonight's show @PV_ConcertHall in Jacksonville. Appreciative audience. Thanks again to @RealTimWilkins for opening. I had no idea I did a 2 hr set tonight. I'm happily addicted again to this s—t."                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Saget, though known on the stage and among his friends for his raunchy humor, first became known to audiences on family-friendly programming. He starred as the widowed father of three girls on ABC's "Full House" and then as host of the network's "America's Funniest Home Videos" clip show.                                                                                                                                          , As Saget recalled to Jake Tapper in a July 2021 interview, the track of his career was unexpected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "'Full House' was an accident," he said. "I got fired on CBS and was asked to be in 'Full House.'"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The sitcom, which starred Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin and twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen in one role, ran for eight seasons. It lived on in syndication with strong enough nostalgia surrounding it that Netflix picked up a spin-off in 2016, "Fuller House," starring Bure but featuring frequent appearances from original stars, including Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos. It ran for five seasons, concluding in 2020. , "I'm close with all the kids. It doesn't happen a lot in the world where you stay close with all the people," Saget told Tapper. "We're an unusual cast in that way that I have been able to remain close with everybody, because I don't take eight years of my life lightly and then the other five or six years, six seasons."                                                                                                          , His "Full House" co-star Stamos expressed his grief over the loss of his friend and former colleague on Sunday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "I am broken. I am gutted," Stamos wrote on Twitter. "I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Following his first round of sitcom fame, Saget worked steadily in film and television roles but became known to a new generation of sitcom fans on CBS's "How I Met Your Mother," acting as narrator and the voice of future Ted Mosby. That show ran until 2014.                                                                                                                                                                         , Throughout the years, Saget remained a fixture in stand-up comedy, releasing multiple specials over the years and taking his show on the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Saget's reputation for reveling in a much edgier brand of comedy could be seen in movies like "The Aristocrats" -- exploring the competition among comics to tell the filthiest version of the same joke -- and his guest stint on HBO's "Entourage" as a version of himself.                                                                                                                                                              , Asked by Esquire to define his humor in a 2013 interview, Saget explained, "I am basically just a nine-year-old boy that evolved." Toward that end, Saget seemed to relish pushing back against his success in squeaky-clean shows, telling dirty jokes at ABC events to make the executives squirm.                                                                                                                                       , Saget was in the midst of a tour at the time of his death that was set to take him to locations in New York, Canada and several other locations in the coming months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , According to his website, Saget often hosted comedy events to raise money for the Scleroderma Research Foundation, for which he served on the board of directors. He lost his sister to the chronic disease in 1994, his website said.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , In 2020, he launched a podcast, titled "Bob Saget's Here For You," an interview show where he welcomed guests like Tiffany Haddish, Jason Sudeikis, Whoopi Goldberg and Norman Lear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Lear was one of the many who paid tribute to Saget on Sunday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "Bob Saget was as lovely a human as he was funny," Lear wrote on Twitter. "And to my mind, he was hilarious.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index shed 0.1% to around 7,445 on Monday, as Australian tech names remained under pressure from prospects of higher interest rates, while investors continued to monitor the Covid situation closely. High-growth technology stocks sold off globally at the start of the year amid strong hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve, which indicated that it could tighten monetary policy more aggressively than anticipated. The biggest decliners in local tech names include Xero Ltd (-3%), Afterpay (-2.6%), Wisetech Global (-3.6%), Nextdc Ltd (-1.9%) and Seek Ltd (-1%). Healthcare, consumer and financial stocks also fell, while energy and mining firms mostly gained. Meanwhile, authorities in the country reinstated some restrictions to battle a record spike in Covid cases, with an official modeling indicating that the omicron outbreak in New South Wales could peak by the end of January. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Private house approvals in Australia increased by 1.4 percent month-over-month to 10,892 units in November 2021, slowing from a 3.5 percent gain a month earlier, a preliminary figure showed.  The series has been at historically elevated levels over the past year, largely driven by government stimulus and record low-interest rates. "While private house approvals are no longer at record highs, the November result remains 25.8 percent higher than the pre-pandemic level in November 2019, indicating ongoing strength in the detached housing market," said Daniel Rossi, ABS Director of Construction Statistics.  Approvals rose in Queensland (7.4 percent), South Australia (6.4 percent), and New South Wales (5.4 percent), while falls were recorded in both Western Australia (-12.1 percent) and Victoria (-0.8 percent). </td>

This marked the first rise in building permits since August, driven by an increase in approvals for private sector dwellings excluding houses, which rose 9.7 percent following a 37.9 percent slump in October. Meanwhile, private sector houses continued to level off (1.4 percent vs 3.5 percent) after being at historically elevated levels over the past year due to government stimulus and record low-interest rates.

Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures each fell 0.2%, while Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.15%.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Energy bills: Fix insulation to tackle cost of heating, PM told </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Better insulation could save UK households more than £500 a year on energy bills, according to a group of business organisations and charities.                                                                                                                                                      , The Energy Efficiency Infrastructure Group is calling on the prime minister to prioritise energy saving through home improvements.                                                                                                                                                                   , It could save the UK £7.8bn a year, the group says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The government is under political pressure to take action over rocketing gas bills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Households have seen energy bills rise in recent months and further increases will take effect in April, when the energy price cap will be raised to take higher wholesale gas prices into account.                                                                                                  , The government is exploring ways to support those on low incomes who will struggle to afford higher heating costs.                                                                                                                                                                                   , But the EEIG, which includes the CBI, Kingfisher, Energy Savings Trust and the green group WWF, says this and previous administrations are partly to blame for higher bills because they failed to ensure Britain's homes are adequately insulated.                                                  , "The cost-of-living crisis is being driven by soaring gas prices," said EEIG chairwoman Sarah Kostense-Winterton. "A permanent solution to lower bills is by reducing demand through energy efficiency measures.                                                                                     , "Emergency short-term measures for the most vulnerable households are crucial, but it's fundamental for the government to simultaneously focus on the long term to avoid futures crises.                                                                                                             , "Green home retrofits have significant social, environmental and economic co-benefits, and stand out as a 'no regrets' solution to the energy crisis, climate crisis, and levelling up agenda."                                                                                                      , Britain has the coldest and leakiest housing stock in western Europe, leaving residents particularly exposed to spikes in gas prices.                                                                                                                                                                , Successive governments have failed to implement policies to tackle the problem. The most recent insulation scheme, the Green Homes Grant, was scrapped after just six months.                                                                                                                        , The chancellor was urged by backbench MPs to use last autumn's Budget to introduce a multi-year energy efficiency programme, but he declined.                                                                                                                                                        , In the short term the EEIG wants the government to provide additional support for vulnerable households to prevent a fuel poverty emergency.                                                                                                                                                         , This would include expanding the Warm Homes Discount, an option the government is discussing.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , But the EEIG insists that ministers must also bolster the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) which requires energy suppliers to help low-income households to fit energy-saving measures.                                                                                                               , The group fears that the chancellor may suspend the long-term ECO funding and shift the cash to tackle the immediate bills problem instead.                                                                                                                                                          , The EEIG is warning that cutting ECO would be damaging for households and industry, and would stall progress in making fuel-poor homes more energy efficient, risking green jobs and keeping households hooked on expensive gas.                                                                     , In his manifesto Boris Johnson promised £9bn for energy efficiency up to 2030.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , About £6bn was allocated to be spent this parliament but the EEIG says money not allocated amounts to a broken promise.                                                                                                                                                                              , The EEIG is also calling for a new £3.6bn grant or subsidy scheme to help all households, including private owners, to insulate their homes.                                                                                                                                                         , At the moment, the EEIG maintains, two-thirds of households have no financial support for insulation, even though insulation is a vital part of the strategy to cut carbon emissions.                                                                                                                , The insulation call was backed at the weekend by MPs on the Conservative Environment Network.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , A government spokesman said it had already made huge progress in upgrading the energy efficiency of England's homes - from 9% rated grade C in 2008, to 40% today.                                                                                                                                   , He said all new heating systems installed in UK homes from 2035 will be low-carbon technologies, like heat pumps or hydrogen-ready boilers. This will be a gradual, 14-year transition, and to cut the cost of heat pump, we're offering grants to households worth £5,000.                          , He added: "Improving energy efficiency is the best long term solution to tackling fuel poverty, which is why we are supporting households across the UK to improve their energy performance and reduce bills, having already invested £1.3bn this year alone to upgrade up to 50,000 homes.          , "The Energy Price Cap will remain in place, shielding millions of customers from rising global gas prices, and we are continuing to support lower-income households through £4.2bn in support, including the Home Upgrade Grant, Energy Company Obligation and the new £500m Household Support Fund.", Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The very best from around the world including Beck and The Bridge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Uncovering the story of one of America's most corrupt police units                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , © 2022 BBC.

The Atlantic published the article online in October 2020 and in its November 2020 print issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , After questions were raised by The Washington Post’s media critic, Erik Wemple, The Atlantic took the highly unusual step of retracting the entire article. In a lengthy editor’s note, the outlet said that “new information” had emerged that cast doubt on the accuracy of the article and the “trustworthiness” of Ms. Barrett. The Atlantic also said Ms. Barrett had encouraged a source to lie to its fact checkers and noted details about Ms. Barrett’s background, including plagiarism accusations against her in the 1990s when she was a reporter at The New Republic., In a lawsuit filed on Saturday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., that asks for $1 million in damages, Ms. Barrett accused The Atlantic and Donald Peck, its top print editor at the time, of smearing her reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The Atlantic had caved to pressure from Mr. Wemple, she said, who, in a series of columns, had questioned both the veracity of some of the details in the article, including the description of a fencing injury, and whether The Atlantic had deceived readers by not including Ms. Barrett’s maiden name, which she used at The New Republic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Ms. Barrett stated in the lawsuit that the only “falsehood” The Atlantic had uncovered was the addition of a nonexistent son to the family of “Sloane,” a central character in the article. Ms. Barrett said she had added the son at the request of the anonymous source to help disguise her identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Ms. Barrett also said in the suit that The Atlantic’s editors had employed a similar tactic by changing a quote in her article to shield the identity of someone, which a fact-checker said in a text message was because of “a legal request.” A spokeswoman for The Atlantic, Anna Bross, said in an email: “Our lawyers have never, in this case or any other, advised editors to alter direct quotes. This is a basic journalistic principle; of course, we do not alter quotes.”                                                                                              , Ms. Barrett argued that the inclusion of the son was necessary to protect her source and that she was “acting in accordance with the law and ethical precepts of the profession of journalism.” She also said in the suit the two factual inaccuracies regarding the town one person was from and the size of backyard hockey rinks were “so trivial and insignificant as to hardly warrant correction — let alone the full retraction of a serious and meaningful piece of journalism.”                                                                                           , The Atlantic, in a nearly 1,000-word editor’s note, said that its fact-checking department had gone through the piece and spoken with more than 40 sources, but that Ms. Barrett had misled the fact checkers and lied to the editors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “It is impossible for us to vouch for the accuracy of this article,” the note said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , In the lawsuit, Ms. Barrett also accused The Atlantic of misrepresenting her background and destroying her journalistic career through what it publicly said about her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Ms. Barrett was a rising star in political journalism in the 1990s, when she was in her 20s and wrote under her maiden name Ruth Shalit. She was accused of plagiarism in 1994 and 1995 over several passages and sentences in some of her work that resembled the work of other journalists. She left her job at The New Republic in 1999, and has had few articles published in the last 20 years.                                                                                                                                                                               , The Atlantic said in the editor’s note that it had originally used the byline “Ruth S. Barrett” at Ms. Barrett’s request “but in the interest of transparency, we should have included the name that she used as her byline in the 1990s.” The note said that Ms. Barrett had been assigned the story because “more than two decades separated her from her journalistic malpractice at The New Republic” but that editors regretted the decision.                                                                                                                                 , In the lawsuit, Ms. Barrett accused The Atlantic of folding to pressure from Mr. Wemple and misrepresenting her background. She said that she had an “antagonistic relationship” with the Post journalist leading back to the 1990s when he worked at the Washington City Paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Mr. Wemple said in an email that he did not recall meeting or interacting with Ms. Barrett before 2020, when he wrote his columns about her Atlantic story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “I was doing my job as a media critic,” Mr. Wemple said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Ms. Bross, The Atlantic’s spokeswoman, said the publication stood by its retraction and editor’s note.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “We completely reject the allegations and believe the suit is meritless, will be filing a motion to dismiss, and are confident we will ultimately prevail,” she said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Ms. Barrett’s lawyers offered in early December to settle the case before they filed the lawsuit. In a letter sent to The Atlantic that was obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Barrett’s lawyers said they would not sue if The Atlantic agreed to make corrections to its editor’s note, surrender intellectual property rights to the article and pay Ms. Barrett’s legal fees, which at the time were nearly $120,000.                                                                                                                                                         , “Any post-suit settlement would require monetary compensation, which Ms. Barrett is willing to forego at this point in order to attain some minimal repair of her journalistic reputation,” the letter said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bronx apartment building fire leaves 19 people dead, including 9 children - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)A major fire in a residential apartment building in the Bronx in New York City on Sunday left 19 people dead, including 9 children, in what Mayor Eric Adams described as one of the worst fires the city has experienced in modern times.                                                                                                                                                                       , The blaze sent 32 people to hospitals with life-threatening conditions, Daniel Nigro, commissioner of the New York City Fire Department, said earlier Sunday. A total of 63 people were injured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , A "malfunctioning electric space heater" was the source of the fire, Nigro said during a press conference. The heater was in the bedroom of an apartment, and the fire consumed the room and then the entire apartment, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                       , The apartment door was left open and smoke spread throughout the building when the residents left their unit, Nigro said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , "This is a horrific, horrific, painful moment for the city of New York, and the impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of just pain and despair in our city," Adams said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , About 200 members of the New York City Fire Department responded to the fire at the 19-story building at 333 East 181st Street. The fire began a little before 11 a.m. in a duplex apartment on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the building, the FDNY said.                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Firefighters were met by "very heavy smoke, very heavy fire" in the hallways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Victims were found in stairways on every floor of the building, many in cardiac arrest, in what Nigro said could be an unprecedented loss of life. The injuries were predominantly from smoke inhalation, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Firefighters kept attempting to save people from the building despite running out of air tank, Nigro said. Some of the residents who were trying to leave the building could not "escape because of the volume of smoke."                                                                                                                                                                                              , The FDNY posted several images of the scene showing ladders extending into apartment windows as well as a number of broken windows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , "This is going to be one of the worst fires that we have witnessed during modern times here in the city of New York," Adams said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , "I am horrified by the devastating fire in the Bronx today," New York Gov.

Southwest Airlines suspended over 1,000 flights, more than any other carrier. SkyWest Airlines, which operates flights for several major carriers, and United Airlines each canceled more than 500 flights.                                                    , The turmoil began before Christmas, caused by bad weather in the West and staff shortages because of virus outbreaks among employees. Snowfall in the Northeast continued to wreak havoc at major airport hubs across the country into the first weekend of this month.                                                                                                                                                                            , “Given the ongoing surge in Covid cases and related sick calls, we’ve been working with each of our major partners to proactively reduce our January schedules,” SkyWest said in a statement. The airline operates flights for United, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines and said the pullback is intended to “ensure we’re able to adequately staff our remaining flying as we work to recover in the coming weeks.”         , After canceling flights at high rates over the holidays, JetBlue Airways said it would preemptively cut about 1,300 flights in the first half of January. Alaska said in a statement last week that it would slash about one in 10 flights planned for the month to gain “the flexibility and capacity needed to reset.”                                                                                                                           , As in many other industries, airlines are also contending with workers calling in sick at high rates as the Omicron virus variant spreads at astonishing speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “It has been one of the most difficult operational environments we’ve ever faced,” Allison Ausband, Delta’s chief customer experience officer, said in a statement last week apologizing to customers for the disorder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , To deal with staffing shortages, many carriers have started offering extra pay to those who were otherwise not scheduled to work. Southwest, for example, said last week that it was offering double pay for most of the month to employees who picked up extra shifts, incentives available to workers across its operation, including ground staff, flight attendants, customer service employees, flight schedulers and maintenance technicians., The chaos comes at a frustrating time for the industry, which is preparing for a significant rebound this summer. That recovery rests largely on the hope that the pandemic will be mostly under control by then and that people will be more willing to travel internationally and for work.                                                                                                                                                      , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)At least 34 people were rescued on Saturday after being stranded on a large chunk of floating ice off the shore of Point Comfort on Green Bay, according to the Brown County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin.                        , At about 10:15 a.m., Brown County received a report that a large chunk of ice had broken from the shoreline off Point Comfort and that there were multiple people stranded on it, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. , In less than two hours, all the people who were stranded on the floating ice were rescued with no injuries, according to the release.                                                                                                    , "It is believed a barge that had gone through the Bay shortly before the ice breakage may have contributed to the destabilization of the ice," the sheriff's office said.                                                                , The floating ice chunk was about a mile from shore by the end of the rescue and had floated about three quarters of a mile during the rescue, the sheriff's office said.                                                                 , "Although the chunk of ice remained fairly stable, its condition was deteriorating rapidly (and) cracking up as it moved with the open water pounding at the edge of it," the office added.                                              , Shane Nelson told CNN affiliate WLUK he and Robert Verhagen had been out ice fishing for the first time when they heard a loud noise.                                                                                                    , "It sounded like almost somebody fired a gun out there," Nelson said. "We thought it was interesting. We got out of our shanty, looked and ... a couple people were yelling that the ice was separating."                                , CNN's Laura James and Eric Levenson contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)At least 164 people have been killed and more than 5,000 detained during violent upheaval in Kazakhstan this week, as unrest swept the nation and the death toll ticked even higher.                                                                                                                                                                  , Deadly protests that erupted in in the Central Asian country in recent days have seen the government resign and the declaration of a state of emergency as troops from a Russia-led military alliance have been deployed to help contain the unrest.                                                                                                        , The death toll -- a significant increase from Friday's count of 44 -- was announced Sunday on state-run TV channel Khabar 24, citing the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The unrest is the biggest challenge yet to autocratic Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's rule, with initial public anger over a spike in fuel prices expanding to wider discontent with the government over corruption, living standards, poverty and unemployment in the oil-rich, former Soviet nation, human rights organizations report.          , At least 5,135 people have so far been detained for alleged participation in Kazakhstan protests, Kazakh state media reported Sunday, citing the country's Internal Affairs Ministry.

Roger Ekirch thought that sleep was a biological constant -- that eight hours of rest a night never really varied over time and place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , But while researching nocturnal life in preindustrial Europe and America, he discovered the first evidence that many humans used to sleep in segments -- a first sleep and second sleep with a break of a few hours in between to have sex, pray, eat, chat and take medicine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Here was a pattern of sleep unknown to the modern world," said Ekirch, a university distinguished professor in the department of history at Virginia Tech.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Ekirch's subsequent book, "At Day's Close: Night in Times Past," unearthed more than 500 references to what's since been termed biphasic sleep.  Ekirch has now found more than 2,000 references in a dozen languages and going back in time as far as ancient Greece. His 2004 book will be republished in April.                                                                                                                                                                                       , The practice of sleeping through the whole night didn't really take hold until just a few hundred years ago, his work suggested. It only evolved thanks to the spread of electric lighting and the Industrial Revolution, with its capitalist belief that sleep was a waste of time that could be better spent working.                                                                                                                                                                                  , The history of sleep not only reveals fascinating details about everyday life in the past, but the work of Ekirch, and other historians and anthropologists, is helping sleep scientists gain fresh perspective on what constitutes a good night's sleep. It also offers new ways to cope with and think about sleep problems.                                                                                                                                                                           , There is value in knowing about this prior pattern of sleep in the Western world. "A large number of people who today suffer from middle-of-the-night insomnia, the primary sleep disorder in the United States -- and I dare say in most industrialized countries -- rather than experiencing a quote unquote, disorder, are in fact, experiencing a very powerful remnant, or echo of this earlier pattern of sleep," Ekirch said.                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Myth of 8-hour sleep?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The first reference to biphasic sleep Ekirch found was in a 1697 legal document from a traveling "Assizes" court buried in a London record office. The deposition of a 9-year-old girl called Jane Rowth mentioned that her mother awoke after her "first sleep" to go out. The mother was later found dead.                                                                                                                                                                                             , "I had never heard the expression, and it was expressed in such a way that it seemed perfectly normal," he said. "I then began to come across subsequent references in these legal depositions but also in other sources."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Ekirch subsequently found multiple references to a "first" and "second" sleep in diaries, medical texts, works of literature and prayer books. A doctor's manual from 16th century France advised couples that the best time to conceive was not at the end of a long day but "after the first sleep," when "they have more enjoyment" and "do it better."                                                                                                                                               , By the early 19th century, however, the first sleep had begun to expand at the expense of the second sleep, Ekirch found, and the intervening period of wakefulness. By the end of the century, the second sleep was little more than turning over in one's bed for an extra 10 minutes of snoozing.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ben Reiss, author of "Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World" and professor and chair of the English department at Emory University in Atlanta, blames the Industrial Revolution and the "sleep is for wimps" attitude it engendered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "The answer is really to follow the money. Changes in economic organization, when it became more efficient to routinize work and have large numbers of people showing up on factory floors, at the same time and doing as much work in as concentrated fashion as possible," Reiss said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Our sleep schedule got squeezed and consolidated as a result, Reiss said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , No golden age                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , However, preindustrial life was no halcyon era when our ancestors went about their day well rested and rejuvenated, untroubled by insomnia or other sleep problems, effortlessly in sync with the cycle of night and day, weather patterns and seasons, according to Sasha Handley, a professor of history at The University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. She studies how families optimized their sleep in Britain, Ireland and England's American colonies between 1500 and 1750.              , "Every discussion of sleep history seemed to center around the sort of watershed moment of industrialization, the coming of electricity ruining everybody's sleep lives. The corollary of that is that anything preindustrial was imagined as this golden age of sleep."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Handley said her research suggested, just like today, sleep was linked to physical and mental health and was a topic that people worried about and obsessed over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Doctor's manuals from the time are full of advice on how many hours to sleep and in what kind of posture, she said. The reference guides also list hundreds of sleep recipes to aid a good night's sleep, she said. These include the bizarre -- cutting a pigeon in half and sticking each half to each side of your head and the more familiar -- bathing in camomile-infused water and using lavender. People also burned specific types of wood in their bed chambers that were thought to aid sleep., "For our period, sleep is very strongly linked to digestion, emotion, stomach, and therefore to people's diets," Handley said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Doctors advised sleepers to rest first on the right side of their body before turning to the left side during the second half of the night. Resting on the right, perhaps during the first sleep, was thought to allow food to reach the pit of the stomach, where it was digested. Turning to the left, cooler side, released vapors and spread the heat evenly through the body.                                                                                                                       , It's thought this habit could be the origin of the phrase about getting out of bed on the wrong side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Not all scholars believe that sleeping in two shifts, while perhaps common in some communities, was once a universal habit. Far from it, said Brigitte Steger, a senior lecturer in Japanese studies at the University of Cambridge in the UK, who didn't uncover any references to segmented sleep in her work on sleep habits in Japan.                                                                                                                                                                , "There is no such thing as natural sleep. Sleep has always been cultural, social and ideological," said Steger, who is working on a series of six books about the cultural history of sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "There is not such a clear-cut difference between premodern (or pre-industrial) and modern sleep habits," she said via email. "And sleep habits throughout pre-industrial times and throughout the world have always changed. And, of course, there has always been social diversity, and sleep habits have been very different at court than for peasants, for instance."                                                                                                                               , Similarly, Gerrit Verhoeven, an assistant professor in cultural heritage and history at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, said his study of criminal court records from 18th century Antwerp suggested that sleep habits weren't so different to our own today. Seven hours of sleep was the norm and there was no mention of first or second sleep.                                                                                                                                                 , "As a historian I'm concerned that arguments about alleged sleeping patterns in the past -- prolonged, by-phasic and with napping during the day -- are sometimes presented as a possible remedy for our modern sleeping disorders. Before drawing such conclusions, we have to do much more research about these early modern sleeping patterns," he said.                                                                                                                                              , Rethinking insomnia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Russell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said Ekirch's findings on biphasic sleep, while not without controversy, had informed his work as a sleep scientist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Experiments in sleep labs had shown that when humans are given the opportunity to sleep longer, he said, their sleep can become biphasic or even polyphasic, replicating what Ekirch found in historical records. However, Foster, who is also the director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford, doubted that it was a sleep pattern that would happen for everybody.                                                                                            , Nobody should impose a regime of segmented sleep on themselves, particularly if it resulted in a reduction of total sleep time, he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , What was clear, Foster said, was that interrupted sleep was perceived as less of a problem in the past and that modern expectations about what constitutes a good night's sleep -- sleeping through the night for eight hours -- weren't always helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , He said a key point was waking at night need not mean the end of sleep. One example he cited was more people waking up at night during lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , "They'll get terribly anxious and worried about waking up in the middle of night, because that's not what they normally experience," said Foster, who is also the author of "Life Time: The New Science of the Body Clock, and How It Can Revolutionize Your Sleep and Health," which will be published in May 2022. More likely, what had happened was that people's sleep episode -- how much time they have available for sleep -- had expanded and wasn't constricted by an alarm clock going off.   , "It's a throwback to a time when we genuinely got more sleep," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , If we wake up at night, sleep is likely to return, if sleep is not sacrificed to social media or other behavior that makes you more alert or activates a stress response, Foster's research has suggested. Like most sleep experts, he recommended getting out of bed if you're getting frustrated by the failure to fall back to sleep and engaging in a relaxing activity while keeping the lights low.                                                                                                , "Individual sleep across humans is so variable. One size doesn't fit all. You shouldn't worry about the sort of sleep that you get," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Afghanistan: Baby lost in chaos of airlift is found and returned to family - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (Reuters)An infant boy handed in desperation to a soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan has been found and was reunited with his relatives in Kabul on Saturday.                                                                                                                                    , The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on August 19 as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban.                                                                                                                                                                                     , Following an exclusive Reuters story published in November with his pictures, the baby was located in Kabul where a 29-year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own.                                                                                                                     , After more than seven weeks of negotiations and pleas, and ultimately a brief detention by Taliban police, Safi finally handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives still in Kabul.                                                                                                                                        , They said they would now seek to have him reunited with his parents and siblings who were evacuated months ago to the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , During the tumultuous Afghan evacuation over the summer, Mirza Ali Ahmadi -- the boy's father who had worked as a security guard at the US embassy -- and his wife Suraya feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the United States.                                                , Ahmadi told Reuters in early November in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier who he believed to be an American, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining five meters (15 feet) to the entrance to reclaim him.                                                                        , Just at that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before Ahmadi, his wife and their four other children were able to get inside.                                                                                                                                                                        , But by then the baby was nowhere to be found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later.                                                                                                                                                      , The rest of the family was evacuated -- eventually ending up at a military base in Texas. For months they had no idea where their son was.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The case highlights the plight of many parents separated from their children during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of US forces from the country after a 20-year war.                                                                                                                                                                    , With no US embassy in Afghanistan and international organizations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunifications like this one.                                                                                                                                            , The US Department of Defense, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Alone in the airport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , On the same day Ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby, Safi had slipped through the Kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brother's family who were also set to evacuate.                                                                                                                                                    , Safi said he found Sohail alone and crying on the ground. After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby's parents inside, he decided to take the infant home to his wife and children. Safi has three daughters of his own and said his mother's greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son.                                 , In that moment he decided: "I am keeping this baby. If his family is found, I will give him to them. If not, I will raise him myself," he told Reuters in an interview in late November.                                                                                                                                                             , Safi told Reuters that he took him to the doctor for a check-up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family. They called the baby Mohammad Abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his Facebook page.                                                                                                     , After the Reuters story about the missing child came out, some of Safi's neighbors -- who had noticed his return from the airport months earlier with a baby -- recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article.                                                                              , Ahmadi asked his relatives still in Afghanistan, including his father-in-law Mohammad Qasem Razawi, 67, who lives in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to seek out Safi and ask him to return Sohail to the family.                                                                                                                           , Razawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gifts -- including a slaughtered sheep, several pounds of walnuts and clothing -- for Safi and his family.                                                                                                                                                                    , But Safi refused to release Sohail, insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from Afghanistan with his family. Safi's brother, who was evacuated to California, said Safi and his family have no pending applications for US entry.                                                                                                                  , The baby's family sought help from the Red Cross, which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises, but said they received little information from the organization. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said it does not comment on individual cases.                                                             , Finally, after feeling they had run out of options, Razawi contacted the local Taliban police to report a kidnapping. Safi told Reuters he denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby, not kidnapping him.                                                                                                             , The complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander told Reuters he helped arrange a settlement, which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides. Razawi said the baby's family in the end agreed to compensate Safi around 100,000 Afghani ($950) for expenses incurred looking after him for five months., "The grandfather of the baby complained to us and we found Hamid and based on the evidence we had, we recognized the baby," said Hamid Malang, the chief area controller of the local police station. "With both sides in agreement, the baby will be handed over to his grandfather," he said on Saturday.                                          , In the presence of the police, and amid lots of tears, the baby was finally returned to his relatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Razawi said Safi and his family were devastated to lose Sohail. "Hamid and his wife were crying, I cried too, but assured them that you both are young, Allah will give you male child. Not one, but several. I thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport," Razawi said.                                                            , The baby's parents told Reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , "There are celebrations, dance, singing," said Razawi. "It is just like a wedding indeed."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Now Ahmadi and his wife and other children, who in early December were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in Michigan, hope Sohail will soon be brought to the United States.                                                                                                                                           , "We need to get the baby back to his mother and father. This is my only responsibility," his grandfather said. "My wish is that he should return to them."                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stood by its guidance that Americans who test positive for the coronavirus could end isolation after five days without obtaining a negative test. The omission of a testing requirement has been criticized by some public health experts, and the agency had been widely expected to add testing to its guidelines. Walmart told workers on Tuesday that it would cut its paid time off for workers who contract the virus to one week, down from two. On Friday, the Supreme Court heard arguments on the legality of two rules from the Biden administration: One requires large private businesses to ensure workers are vaccinated or undergo weekly tests and the other requires some health care workers to be vaccinated. Macy’s requested the vaccination status of its employees last week, while Starbucks set a Feb. 9 deadline for its U.S. workers to be fully vaccinated and Citigroup said it would dismiss unvaccinated employees by the end of the month., Employers are still having trouble finding workers. The U.S. economy added 199,000 jobs in December, down from 249,000 in November, the Labor Department said on Friday. It was the weakest job growth of the year, even before the Omicron variant of the coronavirus presented a new threat to the economy. The problem appears to be that demand for workers is outpacing available candidates. The unemployment rate in December fell to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent, while average hourly earnings rose 4.7 percent over the year — a sign that companies are struggling to attract and retain workers. Data released Tuesday showed that more Americans quit their jobs in November than in any other month on record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , After a trial that lasted more than three months and seven days of deliberations, the jury in the Elizabeth Holmes case reached a verdict on Monday, finding the Theranos founder guilty on four of 11 charges of fraud. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, terms that are likely to be served concurrently. The case raised questions about Silicon Valley’s “fake it until you make it” culture and set off a debate about whether Ms. Holmes’s behavior reflects anything other than one entrepreneur’s false and misleading actions. Ms. Holmes is likely to appeal, and a sentencing date is expected to be set this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The entertainment industry heads into a diminished 2022 awards season this week. The Critics Choice Awards, initially scheduled for Sunday, have been postponed indefinitely because of coronavirus concerns. The Golden Globes, also scheduled for Sunday, will take place without an audience or a red carpet after questions were raised about possible financial missteps and a lack of diversity within the group that hands out the awards. The Grammy Awards, originally scheduled for Jan. 31, have been postponed; the Palm Springs International Film Festival, scheduled to run through this week, has been canceled; and the Sundance Film Festival will take place online only at the end of January. Plans for an in-person Academy Awards on March 27 remain unchanged, but relatively few people have seen the movies that are most likely to win Oscars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , On Wednesday, the Department of Labor will report how much prices rose in December. In November, the Consumer Price Index, an important measure of inflation, rose at its fastest rate in nearly 40 years, and central banks around the world have begun efforts to cool off the economy. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting released last week suggested that it may withdraw support for the economy more quickly than previously expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The Senate will hold separate confirmation hearings this week for both Jerome H. Powell, who was nominated by President Biden for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman, and Lael Brainard, Mr. Biden’s nominee for deputy chair. Though some progressive Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have said they will oppose Mr. Biden’s renomination of Mr. Powell, both Democrats and Republicans have expressed support for the appointment, which was widely seen as a signal of consistency. Mr. Powell will probably be asked about the controversy surrounding a financial transaction made by the departing vice chair of the Fed, Richard H. Clarida. Mr. Clarida bought shares in an investment fund that holds stocks one day before the Fed announced that it would rescue markets that were plunging at the start of the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , BlackBerry models that use the company’s operating systems stopped working on Tuesday, ending an era for the once-ubiquitous device. Apple’s market capitalization briefly hit $3 trillion for the first time. Cruises kept cruising despite warnings from the C.D.C. And airlines continued to cancel thousands of flights a day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Quiet Awards Season Has Hollywood Uneasy - The New York Times </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Audiences remain reluctant to return to theaters. And the kinds of movies that used to rely on the sheen of awards to attract moviegoers now find themselves in peril.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Credit...Illustration by Delcan &amp; Co.; Photograph by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Supported by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , By Nicole Sperling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , LOS ANGELES — Steven Spielberg directing a dance-filled musical through the streets of New York. Lady Gaga channeling her Italian roots. Will Smith back on the big screen. This year’s award season was supposed to celebrate Hollywood’s return to glitz and glamour. No more masks, no more socially distanced award shows or Zoom acceptance speeches, no more rewarding films that very few people had seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Now, between the Omicron spike and NBC’s decision not to televise the Golden Globes on Sunday because of the ethical issues surrounding the group that hands out the awards, Hollywood’s traditionally frenetic — and hype-filled — first week of the calendar year has been reduced to a whisper. The AFI Awards were postponed. The Critics’ Choice Awards — scheduled to be televised Sunday night in hopes of filling the void left by the Globes’ absence — were pushed back. The Palm Springs Film Festival, an annual stop along the awards campaign trail, was canceled. And most of those star-driven award favorites bombed at the box office.                                                                                                                                             , The Academy Awards remain scheduled for March 27, with nominations on Feb. 8, but there has been no indication what the event will be like. (The organization already postponed its annual Governors Awards, which for the past 11 years have bestowed honorary Oscars during a nontelevised ceremony.) Will there be a host? How about a crowd? Perhaps most important, will anyone watch? The Academy hired a producer of the film “Girls Trip” in October to oversee the show but has been mum on any additional details, and declined to comment for this article.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Suddenly, 2022 is looking eerily similar to 2021. Hollywood is again largely losing its annual season of superficial self-congratulation, but it is also seeing the movie business’s best form of advertisement undercut in a year when films desperately need it. And that could have far-reaching effects on the types of movies that get made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “For the box office — when there was a fully functioning box office — those award shows were everything,” said Nancy Utley, a former co-chairman of Fox Searchlight who helped turn smaller prestige films like “12 Years a Slave” and “The Shape of Water” into best-picture Oscar winners during her 21-year tenure. “The recognition there became the reason to go see a smaller movie. How do you do that in the current climate? It’s hard.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Many prestige films are released each year with the expectation that most of their box office receipts will be earned in the crucial weeks between the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. The diminishing of the Globes — which collapsed after revelations involving possible financial impropriety, questionable journalistic ethics and a significant lack of diversity in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which administers the awards — had already hobbled that equation. If the Hollywood hype machine loses its awards season engine, it could prove devastating to the already injured box office. The huge audience shift fueled by streaming may be here to stay, with only blockbuster spectacles like “Spider-Man: No Way Home” drawing theatergoers in significant numbers., “The movie business is this gigantic rock, and we’re close to seeing that rock crumble,” said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts and a former executive editor of The Hollywood Reporter. “People have gotten out of the habit of seeing movies on a big screen. Award season is the best single tub-thumping phenomenon for anything in the world. How many years can you go without that?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The Academy Awards were created in 1929 to promote Hollywood’s achievements to the outside world. At its pinnacle, the telecast drew 55 million viewers. That number has been dropping for years, and last year it hit an all-time low — 10.4 million viewers for a show without a host, no musical numbers and a little-seen best picture winner in “Nomadland.” (The film, which was released simultaneously in theaters and on Hulu, grossed just $3.7 million.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Hollywood was planning to answer with an all-out blitz over the past year, even before the awards season. It deployed its biggest stars and most famous directors to remind consumers that despite myriad streaming options, theatergoing held an important place in the broader culture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , It hasn’t worked. The public, in large part, remains reluctant to return to theaters with any regularity. “No Time to Die,” Daniel Craig’s final turn as James Bond, was delayed for over a year because of the pandemic, and when it was finally released, it made only $160.7 million in the United States and Canada. That was $40 million less than the 2015 Bond film, “Spectre,” and $144 million below 2012’s “Skyfall,” the highest-grossing film in the franchise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Well-reviewed, auteur-driven films that traditionally have a large presence on the awards circuit, like “Last Night in Soho” ($10.1 million), “Nightmare Alley” ($8 million) and “Belfast” ($6.9 million), barely made a ripple at the box office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , And even though Mr. Spielberg’s adaptation of “West Side Story” has a 93 percent positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it has earned only $30 million at the domestic box office. (The original grossed $44 million back in 1961, the equivalent of $409 million in today.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , According to a recent study, 49 percent of prepandemic moviegoers are no longer buying tickets. Eight percent say they will never return. Those numbers are a death knell for the midbudget movies that rely on positive word of mouth and well-publicized accolades to get patrons into seats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Some believe the middle part of the movie business — the beleaguered category of films that cost $20 million to $60 million (like “Licorice Pizza” and “Nightmare Alley”) and aren’t based on a comic book or other well-known intellectual property — may be changed forever. If viewing habits have been permanently altered, and award nominations and wins no longer prove to be a significant draw, those films will find it much more difficult to break even. If audiences are willing to go to the movies only to see the latest “Spider-Man” film, it becomes hard to convince them that they also need see a movie like “Belfast,” Kenneth Branagh’s black-and-white meditation on his childhood, in a crowded theater rather than in their living rooms.                                  , “All of this doesn’t just affect individual films and filmmakers’ careers,” Mr. Galloway said. “Its effect is not even just on a business. It affects an entire art form. And art is fragile.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Of the other likely best-picture contenders given a significant theatrical release, only “Dune,” a sci-fi spectacle based on a known property, crossed the $100 million mark at the box office. “King Richard” earned $14.7 million, and “Licorice Pizza” grossed $7 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “The number of non-genre adult dramas that have cracked $50M is ZERO,” the film journalist and historian Mark Harris wrote on Twitter on Thursday. “The world of 2019, in which ‘1917’ made $160M, ‘Ford v. Ferrari’ made $120M, and ‘Parasite’ made $52M, is gone.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Still, studios are adjusting. MGM is slowing down its theatrical rollout of “Licorice Pizza” after watching other prestige pictures stumble when they entered more than 1,000 theaters. It is also pushing its release in Britain of “Cyrano,” starring Peter Dinklage, to February to follow the American release with the hope that older female moviegoers will return to the cinema by then. Sony Pictures Classics is redeploying the playbook it used in 2021: more virtual screenings and virtual Q.&amp;A.s to entice academy voters while also shifting distribution to the home faster. Its documentary “Julia,” about Julia Child, hit premium video-on-demand over the holidays.                                                                                                             , Many studios got out in front of the latest pandemic wave with flashy premieres and holiday parties in early December that required proof of vaccination and on-site testing. But so far in January, many of the usual awards campaigning events like screenings and cocktail parties are being canceled or moved to the virtual world. “For your consideration” billboards are still a familiar sight around Los Angeles, but in-person meet-and-greets are largely on hold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Netflix, which only releases films theatrically on a limited basis and doesn’t report box office results, is likely to have a huge presence on the award circuit this year with films like “Tick, Tick … Boom,” “The Power of the Dog” and “The Lost Daughter” vying for prizes. Like most other studios, it, too, has moved all in-person events for the month of January to virtual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “Last year was a tough adaptation, and it’s turning out that this year is also going to be about adapting to what’s going on in the moment,” Michael Barker, a co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, said in a telephone interview last week. He spoke while walking the frigid streets of Manhattan instead of basking in the sunshine of Palm Springs, where he was supposed to be honoring Penélope Cruz, his leading lady in the Oscar contender “Parallel Mothers.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “You just compensate by doing what you can,” he said, “and once this passes, then you have to look at what the new world order will be.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Advertisement </td>

She led the health care technology company’s recruitment efforts, met with expecting moms planning for maternity leave and helped staff decide whether to spend their wellness benefits on therapy or a massage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , But like many working people, she found that the pandemic broke open her job description and filled it with new responsibilities. And like many human resources professionals, she found that she sometimes had to play a role akin to company nurse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , As Covid first started to spread, Ms. Ganesh made sure employees had stipends to set up work spaces at home and planned virtual activities, like a magic show and a cooking competition, to keep people connected. By last fall, she was in the meeting with the chief executive writing up her company’s vaccine mandate, which requires that all employees, even those working remotely, be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. She reviews every request for a vaccine rule exemption from people who would rather submit to regular coronavirus testing.                                                                                                                  , “What happens if employees test positive for Covid? How do we take care of them, and the role, if they’re out for a significant period of time? There’s a lot of new complexity that Covid has brought to the world of H.R.,” said Ms. Ganesh, whose company has about 150 employees globally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Just as the Covid-19 crisis made amateur epidemiologists of people trying to go about their daily lives, it also forced H.R. professionals, especially those at small and midsize businesses, into a new focus on public health. As companies weighed when to return to the office, whether to require coronavirus vaccines and what sort of exemptions from those rules to allow, it was often H.R. directors who were asked to lead those efforts. It was no longer sufficient for these professionals to manage the job satisfaction and career development of their colleagues. Suddenly, they were also charged with monitoring their health, safety and views on immunization., The added dimensions of H.R. jobs are coming into sharper focus now, as more organizations put vaccine mandates into effect. About 17 percent of American employers were requiring vaccinations or negative Covid tests for employees returning to the office, according to a Gallagher survey of more than 500 employers conducted between August and October.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Hovering over company conversations about vaccines is the additional consideration of whether to mandate booster shots. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not updated its definition of “fully vaccinated” but said that being “up to date” on vaccination includes a booster. And some state and local leaders like Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York have indicated that they plan to include a booster requirement as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Then there’s the tug of war over return to office plans, with the pull of executives eager to see workers in person meeting the push of soaring Covid case counts. On top of that has come the challenge of retaining talent when workers are walking off the job, with 4.5 million leaving their roles voluntarily in November. The sources of stress, for some H.R. directors, seem to multiply by the month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , For George Boué, who ran H.R. at Stiles, a commercial real estate company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the anxieties of his job began to increase this fall. He kept jerking awake at 3 a.m., his mind racing with questions. How was he going to roll out a vaccine mandate to his colleagues who viewed it as an intrusion? More important, how was he going to keep everybody in his office safe?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Mr. Boué, who is fully vaccinated, was surrounded by friends in South Florida who were citing misinformation about the vaccine. He estimated that one-third of his 300-person staff is most likely not fully vaccinated. When the Labor Department rolled out its vaccine rule in November, requiring large businesses to get their workers vaccinated or tested weekly, Mr. Boué started drafting the terms for his company’s vaccine policy; then he put it on hold because of legal battles over the mandates, especially in Florida. Mr. Boué decided that among teammates he wouldn’t refer to the policy as a mandate, because he wanted to temper tensions whenever he could., “There’s those that are feeling the world is coming to an end, and this is horrible, and those on the other side of the spectrum that feel this is all a bunch of baloney,” he said. “The toughest part of my role has been trying to address all sides.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , His responsibilities continued to grow thornier since the start of the pandemic: In the early months, his team had to order gallons of disinfectant and hundreds of masks. Last summer, they had to start enforcing mask requirements in the office for unvaccinated employees, though his team did not ask for proof of vaccination for that rule and instead went by “the trust factor.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Some executives are outsourcing Covid safety work to companies that set up turnkey vaccine and testing systems. DocGo, for example, a health care and technology company, creates testing programs for businesses and monitors the maintenance of employee confidentiality, data privacy and compliance with federal government standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Still, Anthony Capone, DocGo’s president, said he hears regularly from H.R. directors, especially those worried that their unvaccinated workers will struggle to obtain Covid tests, which could mean employers are in violation of government guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , H.R. professionals said they’re trying, wherever possible, to point toward government rules and to emphasize to employees that they’re simply following advice from public health authorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “I try not to be a doctor or a scientist,” said Amy Zimmerman, the chief people officer of Relay Payments, a software company based in Atlanta with just over 100 employees. “We’ve got institutions like the World Health Organization and the C.D.C. and really smart people who are making decisions that if you’re reasonable, you trust.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Still, there are plenty of scientific decisions — especially those on vaccine rule exemptions — that have to be made on a case-by-case basis, and they tend to fall to an H.R. team that doesn’t have scientific training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Ms. Zimmerman’s company currently allows its staff to work from home, but those coming into the office have to show proof of full vaccination. The requests for exemptions from that rule go straight to H.R. One involved concerns about fertility treatments, but the employee could not get a supporting doctor’s note and now cannot come into the office. Another was from an employee who had been previously infected with coronavirus, who Ms. Zimmerman’s team determined would have to show proof of antibodies every 90 days.                                                                                                                                            , Relay Payments also had two large in-person gatherings last year, where it required both proof of vaccination and a negative test 72 hours before arrival. Right before its December gathering, an employee who was fully vaccinated tested positive and skipped the event. Ms. Zimmerman was relieved that he caught the case before his flight from home, which she viewed as validation of the company’s move to require both vaccines and testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Now her team is weighing whether to mandate boosters. She said they might hold off on for now, though they would continue to follow C.D.C. recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Making these kinds of decisions demands constant consumption of news by business leaders, with many seeking out online expertise about Covid: “The C.D.C. is my main source, but there’s multiple channels and mediums I’m plugged into,” said Ms. Ganesh, at Florence Healthcare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Mr. Boué, in South Florida, has finally hit his limit on H.R. angst. He retired at the end of last year. His wife works at a hospital, and with the anxieties she carries — about freezer trucks and overflowing beds — he feels he can’t take home his own set of work worries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Mr. Boué used to wake up raring to get to the office: “Even though I’m antisocial, I do enjoy working and helping people out,” he said. But the last two years have undercut that sense of enthusiasm: “There wasn’t a particular ‘Aha!’ moment,” he added. “I just realized the stress wasn’t good for me.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)Next week may see one of the most significant and defining moments in relations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia since the break-up of the Soviet Union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , On Wednesday, representatives from NATO, its 30 member states, and the Russian Federation will meet in Brussels, primarily to discuss the recent military buildup of Russian troops on the border between Russia and Ukraine. US and Russian diplomats will meet in Geneva Monday to discuss the crisis as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said there are "two paths," and that the option of "diplomacy and de-escalation" was one of two the US and international community had laid out for Moscow ahead of the meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Blinken met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Stockholm, Sweden, in December amid growing concern among Western powers that Russia was seeking to invade Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The recent escalation in tension has sparked fears of a repeat of 2014, when Russia forcibly annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. This act, the fact that Russia was able to do it and get away with it, triggered years of serious conversations in policy circles about the role of the West and whether or not it was capable of standing up to Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Relations between the West and Russia never rebounded after that point -- instead, almost reaching Cold War-level lows. The NATO-Russia Council, founded in 2002 as a talking shop for cooperation between the West and Russia, has not met in over two years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Blinken said Friday that progress could be made during next week's diplomatic talks between US, European and Russian officials, but that it had to be a "two-way street" with Russia deescalating its aggression toward Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , While multiple NATO officials told CNN that, in their view, the fact that Russia has finally agreed to meet is a major concession and a sign that diplomacy could lead to a deescalation, they are also cautious that an increasingly hostile Kremlin might not be meeting in good faith.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , It was only last month that Moscow published two draft agreements outlining its demands for defusing tensions on the Ukrainian border. Those demands include rolling back NATO deployments in Eastern Europe to some point in the 1990s, meaning many countries that neighbor Russia and were under the control of the Soviet Union would be less protected by the alliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , This, along with a promise of NATO not expanding further east, is an unacceptable demand and a non-starter from NATO's perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , So what are the Russians hoping for?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , NATO sources say the demands could be "deliberately ridiculous to force a rollback on things like admitting new NATO members, pulling the likes of Ukraine and Finland from the mix," or could simply be "a performance that allows Russian officials to say they tried to negotiate in order to justify an escalation to their citizens."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Given both sides' inflexibility, what is the point of the meeting?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , According to officials from the most vocal and oldest NATO members, Wednesday is an opportunity for the alliance to lay down a firm and unified position: If Russia does escalate tensions, it will face "serious economic consequences. We will use tools that weren't deployed in 2014."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Officials who spoke to CNN were not forthcoming on what those tools would be because "signposting them would give Russia the opportunity to prepare for them, defeating the purpose," however it's fair to say that they would be a mixture of hard economic sanctions and even more NATO on Russia's doorstep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Risky as Western hostility might be in provoking Putin, inaction could be worse. "Capitulating to out-of-this-world demands would make the overall situation much more dangerous, as it would just embolden the Kremlin to act aggressively," says Pasi Eronen, research analyst at the Conflict Studies Research Centre. "Moreover, China and other revisionists are watching the reaction to a Kremlin gamble."                                                                                                                                                                                           , What is notable when talking to officials and experts is a sense that the West is far less scared of Russia than it has been in recent years. Poisonings and assassination of Russian citizens on foreign soil, brutal suppression and imprisonment of political opponents, interference in foreign elections and the annexation of Crimea have all painted an image of Putin as a strong leader who must be feared.                                                                                                                                                                                        ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Naturally, if you live in Russia or a neighboring nation and have opposed Putin, then he is a scary individual. However, his escalating aggression might in part be down to his diminished power in other areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Putin is an aging autocrat, obsessed with the legacy of his rule, and that of the failure of the Soviet Union," says Eronen. "Russia has been ravaged by Covid-19, and the future of its hydrocarbon export economy looks bleak."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , This economic weakness is where the West, if it remains united, may possibly be able to force Putin's hand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "His country has an economy roughly the same size as New York. If the West properly coordinated economic sanctions against him and against Russian business without fear, he would be backed into a corner very quickly," says Bill Browder, a prominent American-born financier whose push for the Magnitsky Act sanctions has infuriated the Kremlin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , While the West has imposed sanctions on Russia in recent years for various Kremlin misdeeds, it's fair to say they could have gone further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , That's partly why next week is so important: if NATO allies do all get on the same page, it could send the strongest possible message at a critical moment. Just as Putin tries to push his luck again, the West has the opportunity to say in a formal diplomatic setting that it's run out of patience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In order to make any new sanctions more effective than previous attempts to punish Russia, the West must be prepared to suffer some pain. In the past, it has avoided targeting Russian sovereign debt and the energy trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , According to Richard Connolly, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, "raising the costs of doing business for Russian firms, either by restricting access to capital, or by restrictions to accessing technologies," could have a bigger impact on the Russian economy and on Putin's inner circle than targeting individuals because "most critical Russian business is in some way connected to Kremlin."                                                                                                                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , He also says that "imposing secondary sanctions on those that trade with Russia" in things like energy, arms and strategic goods could do similar levels of harm that secondary sanctions have done to Iran.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , On the thornier question of traditional hard power and the potential expansion of NATO, some believe that the allies have reason to feel bullish when they meet with the Russians on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , "We need to join forces and not be afraid. Putin is afraid -- not us. He is afraid of his own people, afraid of democratic elections," says Rasa Juknevičienė, Lithuania's former defense minister. She believes that now is the time to accelerate Ukraine's accession to NATO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , "Europe cannot return to the times of Hitler and Stalin, when nations were divided. Ukrainians, not the Kremlin, have to decide, what will be the future of Ukraine. The success of Ukraine would be the best remedy against the Kremlin. They fear it most," she adds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Obviously, talks next week will be tense and solving the Ukrainian crisis is not going to be easy. Putin can be at his most dangerous when backed into a corner, observers say, and he is currently juggling multiple foreign-policy crises after Russian troops were deployed to neighboring Kazakhstan to quell unrest following violent anti-government protests. A running theme over the past few years has been Putin leaping on Western errors in judgment -- from the Afghanistan withdrawal to inaction in Syria -- and using whatever power he has to bolster his reputation as a powerful leader., And as multiple NATO officials conceded, Putin cares about Ukraine a lot more than many in the West and will have limitless patience to get what he wants if he senses weakness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The West goes into next week with so many strategic advantages over Russia, it should on paper be relatively easy to force Putin's hand toward deescalation in the east of Europe. However, Putin hasn't remained in power for over 20 years for no reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , If the West is to successfully leverage its position at this critical moment and cut Putin down to size, its unity must be uncrackable. A repeat of the mistakes of 2014 could create an even more dangerous version of the Russian leader if he is able to stare down the most powerful alliance on earth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)The politics of Kazakhstan are notoriously opaque and bureaucratic, but in the past few days President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has shed his image as a compliant, colorless placeholder.                                                                                                                                                                                , With a little help from Moscow, Tokayev has ruthlessly turned the tables on his mentor, Nursultan Nazarbaev, the man who ruled Kazakhstan from independence in 1991 to 2019 and was still known as Leader of the Nation, until Wednesday.                                                                                                                                   , Analysts say Kazakhstan has now entered a period of treacherous transition -- but Tokayev has emerged victorious in round one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , As the city of Almaty echoed to the sound of gunfire on January 5, Tokayev abandoned the moderate tone he'd used when the protests began, and launched -- in effect -- a palace coup.                                                                                                                                                                                       , His swift action was all the more surprising because Tokayev was widely seen as an urbane technocrat still beholden to Nazarbaev, who hand-picked him as his successor in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                             , Kate Mallinson, central Asia analyst with the London-based political risk group Prism, said the swift move against Nazarbaev allies "came as a shock. In Kazakhstan everything is bureaucracy -- but not this time."                                                                                                                                                        , Paul Stronski, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Tokayev took "pretty bold steps for someone seen as a puppet."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , In the space of a few hours Nazarbaev lost his tenure as head of the Security Council, a title Tokayev took himself. Also out: Prime Minister Askar Mamin, originally appointed shortly before Nazarbaev left office, as well as several more Nazarbaev loyalists.                                                                                                          , Stronski says a "huge struggle is going on among Kazakhstan's elite," and it's difficult to predict how it will unfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , A toxic association                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Despite his lack of a power base remotely comparable to that of the Nazarbaevs, Tokayev appears to have calculated that the association was toxic, amid widespread anger about unemployment, the cost of living and rampant corruption among an elite closely associated with Nazarbaev.                                                                                    , Tokayev was already aware that Nazarbaev's legacy was a mixed blessing. Nearly three years ago, he was on the receiving end of protests when the capital was renamed Nur-Sultan in Nazarbaev's honor. This week Tokayev stopped using the name.                                                                                                                             , Tokayev's actions on January 5 may have been preemptive, according to analysts. In the previous 24 hours, according to Mallinson, the powerful intelligence chief Karim Masimov had reportedly told Tokayev that the Nazarbaev family had lost confidence in him and "his time was up."                                                                                     , Tokayev fired Masimov, replacing him with the head of the Presidential Protection Service. The next day, according to an official statement reported by state media, Masimov "and other persons were detained and placed in a temporary detention facility" on suspicion of committing treason.                                                                             , The spasm of violence in Almaty may have been part of this sudden power struggle. Tokayev himself said the "bandits and terrorists are very well trained, organized and are under the command of a special center," though stressed it was based abroad.                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Stronski says organized criminal groups appear to have been involved in mobilizing gangs of well-armed men on the streets but there remain "big questions about who these groups are and who sent them in."                                                                                                                                                                 , The unrest metastasized in hours from being grassroots protests in the far west of Kazakhstan into a grab for power in Almaty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , But moves as bold as those taken by Tokayev on Wednesday require some form of insurance. Enter Russian President Vladimir Putin. As he fired anyone who he believed might pose a threat, Tokayev appealed to the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization to send in peacekeepers -- an appeal that was swiftly accepted.                                        , His message was clear: Moscow's on my side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Fyodor Lukyanov, research director at the Moscow-based Valdai Discussion Club wrote in Russian outlet RT that the question is whether "deploying the CSTO peacekeepers would spell the end of clan rivalry in Kazakhstan."                                                                                                                                                  , Stronski says that may come at a cost to Tokayev. For Kazakhstan's middle-class "stability is welcomed -- but having to depend on the Russians is not."                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mallinson says her contacts in Kazakhstan are "spitting mad" about the Russians' arrival. If Tokayev wants to retain his credibility, they will have to be gone in days, she says. But "there's no such thing as a free lunch with Putin."                                                                                                                                  , As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it Friday: "Once Russians are in your house, sometimes it is very difficult to get them to leave."                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Tensions in St. Petersburg                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Russia -- which has a 7,600 km (4,750 mile) border with Kazakhstan -- may already have been uneasy about discord among the Kazakh leadership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , On December 28 both Tokayev and Nazarbaev were in St. Petersburg to meet Putin, along with leaders of other former Soviet states. Mallinson said there were apparently tensions between the two Kazakh leaders at the meeting.                                                                                                                                              , The Kremlin may have sent signals about its preference -- highlighting a bilateral chat between Putin and Tokayev, who also stood next to the Russian leader in the group photograph.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Putin has spoken regularly with Tokayev since January 5, but the Kremlin has said nothing about any contacts with Nazarbaev.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , A long transition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Observers see the events of this week as just the first episode in a long and difficult transition in Kazakhstan. Economic stagnation, a restive younger generation and Tokayev's gamble on repression rather than outreach are a combustible mix.                                                                                                                          , Even if the Nazarbaevs have lost their levers of political power, they are entrenched among Kazakh oligarchs worth billions of dollars who control the oil and gas industries and much of the banking sector, and who have stashed billions of dollars overseas. A recent Chatham House report estimated this elite owns at least $720 million in property in London alone. , How and whether they come to terms with the new order will be critical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Paul Stronski says the massive economic power of Nazarbaev allies means that "we are just at the beginnings of understanding this power struggle."                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Mallinson agrees, saying: "It's going to be incredibly hard to rule the country and dismantle this system that's been configured by Nazarbaev."                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , For now, Tokayev is going for the Putin playbook. His language in a Friday address echoed that of Putin, "who has historically employed terms such as 'bandits' and 'liquidation' when speaking of rebels in the wayward region of Chechnya, for example," writes Kazakhstan-based journalist Joanna Lillis.                                                                , In a warning to social activists and the media, Tokayev also said that "Democracy is not all-permissiveness and, still less, incitement, including in the blogosphere, to illegal acts."                                                                                                                                                                                    , Zachary Witlin, senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, says that going forward Kazakhstan "could look more like Belarus, whose leadership remains in a constant crisis of legitimacy, and order depends on a repressive police state."                                                                                                                                        , Certainly, the man who described himself as the "Listening President"  when he first took office is now doing plenty of warning to consolidate his grip on power.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

Yet Tesla racked up record sales quarter after quarter and ended the year having sold nearly twice as many vehicles as it did in 2020 unhindered by an industrywide crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Tesla’s ability to conjure up critical components has a greater significance than one year’s car sales. It suggests that the company, and possibly other young electric car businesses, could threaten the dominance of giants like Volkswagen and G.M. sooner and more forcefully than most industry executives and policymakers realize. That would help the effort to reduce the emissions that are causing climate change by displacing more gasoline-powered cars sooner. But it could hurt the millions of workers, thousands of suppliers and numerous local and national governments that rely on traditional auto production for jobs, business and tax revenue., Tesla and its enigmatic chief executive, Elon Musk, have said little about how the carmaker ran circles around the rest of the auto industry. Now it’s becoming clear that the company simply had a superior command of technology and its own supply chain. Tesla appeared to better forecast demand than businesses that produce many more cars than it does. Other automakers were surprised by how quickly the car market recovered from a steep drop early in the pandemic and had simply not ordered enough chips and parts fast enough.                                                                                                                           , When Tesla couldn’t get the chips it had counted on, it took the ones that were available and rewrote the software that operated them to suit its needs. Larger auto companies couldn’t do that because they relied on outside suppliers for much of their software and computing expertise. In many cases, automakers also relied on these suppliers to deal with chip manufacturers. When the crisis hit, the automakers lacked bargaining clout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Just a few years ago, analysts saw Mr. Musk’s insistence on having Tesla do more things on its own as one of the main reasons the company was struggling to increase production. Now, his strategy appears to have been vindicated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Cars are becoming increasingly digital, defined by their software as much as their engines and transmissions. It’s a reality that some old-line car companies increasingly acknowledge. Many, including Ford and Mercedes-Benz, have said in recent months that they are hiring engineers and programmers to design their own chips and write their own software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , “Tesla, born in Silicon Valley, never outsourced their software — they write their own code,” said Morris Cohen, a professor emeritus at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in manufacturing and logistics. “They rewrote the software so they could replace chips in short supply with chips not in short supply. The other carmakers were not able to do that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “Tesla controlled its destiny,” Professor Cohen added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Tesla sold 936,000 cars globally in 2021, an 87 percent increase for the year. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, the company formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, all sold fewer cars in 2021 than they did in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Measured by vehicles delivered globally, Tesla vaulted past Volvo and Subaru in 2021, and some analysts predicted that it could sell two million cars this year, as factories in Berlin and Austin, Texas, come online and a plant in Shanghai ramps up production. That would put Tesla in the same league as BMW and Mercedes — something few in the industry thought possible just a couple of years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , G.M. and Ford, of course, sell many more cars and trucks. Both companies said last week that they sold around two million vehicles last year just in the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Tesla, which rarely answers questions from reporters, did not respond to a request for comment for this article. It has said little publicly about how it managed to soar in a down market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate the challenges caused by these shortages,” the company said in its third-quarter earnings report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The performance is a stark turnaround from 2018, when Tesla’s production and supply problems made it an industry laughingstock. Many of the manufacturing snafus stemmed from Mr. Musk’s insistence that the company make many parts itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Other car companies have realized that they need to do some of what Mr. Musk and Tesla have been doing all along and are in the process of taking control of their onboard computer systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Mercedes, for example, plans to use fewer specialized chips in coming models and more standardized semiconductors, and to write its own software, said Markus Schäfer, a member of the German carmaker’s management board who oversees procurement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , In the future, Mercedes will “make sure we have customized, standardized chips in the car,” Mr. Schäfer said in an interview on Wednesday. “Not one thousand different chips.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Mercedes will also design its own vehicle hardware, he said. Without mentioning Tesla, Mr. Schäfer added, “Probably some others were earlier going down this road.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Doing more on its own also helps explain why Tesla avoided shortages of batteries, which have limited companies like Ford and G.M. from selling lots of electric cars. In 2014, when most carmakers were still debating whether electric vehicles would ever amount to anything, Tesla broke ground on what it called a gigafactory outside Reno, Nev., to produce batteries with its partner, Panasonic. Now, that factory helps ensure a reliable supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “It was a big risk,” said Ryan Melsert, a former Tesla executive who was involved in construction of the Nevada plant. “But because they have made decisions early on to bring things in house, they have much more control over their own fate.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , As Professor Cohen of Wharton pointed out, Tesla’s approach is in many ways a throwback to the early days of the automobile, when Ford owned its own steel plants and rubber plantations. In recent decades, the conventional auto wisdom had it that manufacturers should concentrate on design and final assembly and farm out the rest to suppliers. That strategy helped reduce how much money big players tied up in factories, but left them vulnerable to supply chain turmoil.                                                                                                                                                                                   , The pandemic sparked the problem. The highly intricate and interconnected global supply chain is in upheaval. Much of the crisis can be traced to the outbreak of Covid-19, which triggered an economic slowdown, mass layoffs and a halt to production. Here’s what happened next:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A reduction in shipping. With fewer goods being made and fewer people with paychecks to spend at the start of the pandemic, manufacturers and shipping companies assumed that demand would drop sharply. But that proved to be a mistake, as demand for some items would surge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Demand for protective gear spiked. In early 2020, the entire planet suddenly needed surgical masks and gowns. Most of these goods were made in China. As Chinese factories ramped up production, cargo vessels began delivering gear around the globe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Then, a shipping container shortage. Shipping containers piled up in many parts of the world after they were emptied. The result was a shortage of containers in the one country that needed them the most: China, where factories would begin pumping out goods in record volumes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Demand for durable goods increased. The pandemic shifted Americans’ spending from eating out and attending events to office furniture, electronics and kitchen appliances – mostly purchased online. The spending was also encouraged by government stimulus programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Strained supply chains. Factory goods swiftly overwhelmed U.S. ports. Swelling orders further outstripped the availability of shipping containers, and the cost of shipping a container from Shanghai to Los Angeles skyrocketed tenfold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Labor shortages. Businesses across the economy, meanwhile, struggled to hire workers, including the truck drivers needed to haul cargo to warehouses. Even as employers resorted to lifting wages, labor shortages persisted, worsening the scarcity of goods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Component shortages. Shortages of one thing turned into shortages of others. A dearth of computer chips, for example, forced major automakers to slash production, while even delaying the manufacture of medical devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , A lasting problem. Businesses and consumers reacted to shortages by ordering earlier and extra, especially ahead of the holidays, but that has placed more strain on the system. These issues are a key factor in rising inflation and are likely to last for months — if not longer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , It also helps that Tesla is a much smaller company than Volkswagen and Toyota, which in a good year produce more than 10 million vehicles each. “It’s just a smaller supply chain to begin with,” said Mr. Melsert, who is now chief executive of American Battery Technology Company, a recycling and mining firm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Tesla lineup is also more modest and easier to supply. The Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle accounted for almost all of the company’s sales in 2021. Tesla also offers fewer options than many of the traditional carmakers, which simplifies manufacturing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “It’s a more streamlined approach,” said Phil Amsrud, a senior principal analyst who specializes in automotive semiconductors at IHS Markit, a research firm. “They are not trying to manage all these different configurations.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Tesla software, which can be updated remotely, is considered the most sophisticated in the auto business. Even so, the company’s cars likely use fewer chips, analysts said, because the company controls functions like battery cooling and autonomous driving from a smaller number of centralized, onboard computers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “Tesla has fewer boxes,” Mr. Amsrud said. “The fewer the components you need right now, the better.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Of course, Tesla could still run into problems as it tries to replicate the growth it achieved in 2021 — it is aiming to increase sales about 50 percent a year for the next several years. The company acknowledged in its third-quarter report that its creative maneuvering around supply chain chaos might not work so well as it increased production and needed more chips and other parts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The electric vehicle market is also becoming much more competitive as the traditional carmakers belatedly respond with models that people want to buy rather than the small electric vehicles typically made to appease regulators. Ford said this past week that it would nearly double production of the Lightning, an electric version of its popular F-150 pickup truck, because of strong demand. Tesla’s pickup truck won’t go on sale for at least another year.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The outlook for the traditional carmakers is likely to improve this year as shortages of semiconductors and other components ease, and as manufacturers get better at coping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Tesla vehicles still suffer from quality problems. The company told regulators in December that it planned to recall more than 475,000 cars for two separate defects. One could cause the rearview camera to fail, and the other could cause the front hood to open unexpectedly. And federal regulators are investigating the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot system, which can accelerate, brake and steer a car on its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “Tesla will continue to grow,” said Stephen Beck, managing partner at cg42, a management consulting firm in New York. “But they are facing more competition than they ever have, and the competition is getting stronger.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The carmaker’s fundamental advantage, which allowed it to sail through the chip crisis, will remain, however. Tesla builds nothing but electric vehicles and is unencumbered by habits and procedures that have been rendered obsolete by new technology. “Tesla started from a clean sheet of paper,” Mr. Amsrud said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , For almost two years, couches have been cubicles. Colleagues are instant message avatars. And people are reconsidering how much they should have to put up with from a boss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Credit...Nicolas Ortega                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Supported by                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , By Emma Goldberg                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The honeymoon phase at Better.com opened with freebies galore. The employees did Zoom scavenger hunts. They did Zoom cooking classes. They were sent tequila and chocolate milk powder and pine boxes branded with the company’s name. They competed for giveaways, including a Peloton. This was the land of corporate-meets-summer-camp, where lunches were covered and training sessions featured funny hats.                                                      , Christian Chapman, 41, compared his feelings during Better.com’s orientation to the head rush of a new relationship. The perks were bountiful, the mission was sound and Mr. Chapman, a mortgage underwriting trainer, fell fast and hard. “LGTM!” he and his teammates cheered, which stood for “Let’s Get That Money.”                                                                                                                                              , Soon, though, there were red flags. Most notable was a video call last summer when Vishal Garg, the company’s chief executive, unleashed an expletive-laden monologue about beating the competition, prompting Mr. Chapman to hit mute and usher his young daughter out of the room.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Then, last month, Mr. Garg summoned 900 Better.com employees, including Mr. Chapman, roughly 9 percent of his staff, and fired them in a Zoom call that was recorded and shared online. Mr. Garg later apologized, but just over one week afterward, the company’s board announced that the founder and chief executive was “taking time off” from his role.                                                                                                          , For almost two years, couches have been offices. Colleagues are instant message avatars. And a work force that had shocking changes imposed on it has reconsidered its basic assumptions about how people treat each other in corporate life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “The tolerance for dealing with jerky bosses has decreased,” observed Angelina Darrisaw, chief executive of the firm C-Suite Coach, who saw a spike of interest in her executive coaching services last year. “You can’t just wake up and lead people,” she added. “Companies are thinking about how do we make sure our managers are actually equipped to manage.”                                                                                                   , The scrutiny of workplace behavior comes after several years of high-profile conversation about appropriate office conduct. The #MeToo movement propelled dozens of executives to step down after accusations of sexual assault. The Black Lives Matter protests after the killing of George Floyd prompted corporate leaders to issue apologies for past discriminatory behaviors and the lack of racial diversity in their work forces and to pledge to make amends., And increasingly, as people’s work routines have been upended by the pandemic, they’ve begun to question the thrum of unpleasantness and accumulation of indignities they used to shrug off as part of the office deal. Some are saying: no more working for jerks.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But it is not illegal to be a jerk, which introduces a hiccup into that mean-colleague reckoning. The definition of a bully is often in the eye of the coffee-fetcher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , The pop culture archetype of recent years is the ice queen with standards higher than her stiletto heels, Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly (a thinly veiled Anna Wintour) in “The Devil Wears Prada.” The sort of boss who might ask, of an assistant: “Is there some reason that my coffee isn’t here? Has she died or something?”                                                                                                                                   , In real life, jerk behavior exists on a spectrum of cringe. There is the founder, whose vision and ambition can make it difficult for staff to question his temper — like Mr. Garg, who accused the employees he fired of “stealing” from the company by putting in too few hours. (In response to requests for comment, Better.com pointed to Mr. Garg’s early December apology for the way he had executed the layoffs.)                                            , There’s the example of the Hollywood mogul Scott Rudin, who made critically acclaimed art, and also threw staplers at underlings. (He later apologized.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , There’s millennial hustle culture unhinged: Away’s former chief executive, Steph Korey, who demanded loyalty and Slack activity at all hours of the day and night. “I hope everyone in this group appreciates the thoughtfulness I’ve put into creating this career development opportunity,” she wrote in a message telling her staff to stop requesting time off. (Ms. Korey apologized, too.)                                                                      , And then there’s the self-determined type, like Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who referred to his own leadership style as MBR, for “management by ridicule.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “You’ve got to be good at intellectual intimidation and rhetorical bullying,” Mr. Ellison once said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , (He later disavowed this as the strategy of an “inexperienced and insecure” C.E.O.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Tessa West, a social psychologist at New York University, wrote a field guide to bad personalities, called “Jerks at Work,” that sketches out a handful — the bulldozer, the free rider, the gaslighter and the kiss up/kick downer. Many of her examples are of bosses, who tend to be harder to report.                                                                                                                                                             , For Ms. West, the quest is personal. Her own encounter with a workplace jerk came during graduate school at the University of Connecticut, when a peer resorted to creative forms of sabotage: giving Ms. West the wrong time for a meeting so that she would arrive late, calling her clothing overly sexualized. (“I dressed like a California girl,” Ms. West said.)                                                                                               , Because the comments did not seem clearly in violation of any code of conduct aside from basic manners, Ms. West hesitated to escalate the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “The climate has changed,” Ms. West reflected. “I think we now recognize these behaviors are really inappropriate.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Reporting to work has always meant accepting a variety of unpleasantries: commutes, precoffee chitchat, people who would like you to do what they tell you to do even if it’s not yet 10 a.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But for some, the last year has rebalanced the power seesaw between worker and boss. Maybe it was the surge of people quitting: A record high 4.5 million Americans voluntarily left their jobs in November. Maybe it was the ebbing will-they-won’t-they tides of return to office plans. Whatever the change, more workers are feeling empowered to call out their managers.                                                                                        , “For the entirety of my career, I would hear this phrase, ‘Be your full self at work,’ and that meant wearing a pop of color,” Ms. Darrisaw said. “Now it means making time for meditation with your team, making time for conversations about how the company is showing up to support your community.”                                                                                                                                                              , Jacquelyn Carter, 26, did not think she was going to quit her job at the start of the pandemic. She was working at a nonprofit in Houston, and she had been taught by her mother, who had worked at the same place for 30 years, that it was important to stick with a team for as long as possible.                                                                                                                                                                  , But the slights started to add up. Some colleagues regularly forgot her name. Others talked over her in meetings. A manager at the organization called an idea of hers “stupid.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , And, as a Black woman, she found herself fielding insensitive remarks from white colleagues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “When you get to be home in your own space, you realize, ‘I don’t have to deal with someone passing me in the hallway and commenting on my hair,’” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , She watched TikToks of other people celebrating their decisions to leave jobs they didn’t like — QuitTok — with its posts featuring Destiny’s Child’s “Bills, Bills, Bills” and Cardi B’s “Money.” One prime example of the genre: A trio of women dance their way offscreen to text that reads: “the company would rather lose 3 reliable hard working employees than fix their toxic management.”                                                                   , Ms. Carter decided that a mean colleague was as good a reason as any to leave her employer, so she started looking for new opportunities, and then joined Ms. Darrisaw’s firm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The bad-boss-goodbye posts also inspired some to jump from retail to office jobs, including Kristofer Flatt, 23, who used to work at a big-box store in Arkansas. He said his managers ignored his pleas for more protective gear, gave him time-consuming tasks with no explanations — “change the item in that aisle to charcoal, not birdseed” — and questioned his request to take time off for a funeral. In spring 2020, he quit and moved to a corporate job.  , “If you’re a business leader and you want to recruit the best talent you can, you need to start prioritizing and doing the work of creating conscious culture,” said Janine Yancey, who runs Emtrain, which provides workplace trainings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “Over the last couple decades, companies have not invested as much time and resources in developing leadership and management skills,” she said. “Everyone’s focused on the technical skills, the what, but not necessarily the how.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Ms. Yancey used to work as an employment lawyer. But she came to feel that the workplace changes she wanted to see wouldn’t be brought about solely by legal reform, something reaffirmed in 2015 when she watched Ellen Pao lose her gender discrimination lawsuit against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers: “The laws are the bare minimum,” Ms. Yancey said. “Society has to change.”                                                     , Shani Ospina’s work is trying to accelerate that change. She is a professional jerk patroller. An executive coach who works with Strategyzer, a software and consulting company, she conducts 90-minute screenings during the interview process to assess the personality fit of job candidates, helping to enforce the company’s emphasis on being a team player.                                                                                                    , “What aspect of yourself are you most proud of?” Ms. Ospina starts out by asking. Then she gets deeper: “What aspect about yourself would you most like to change?” (She braces for the wince-inducing “I got promoted a year later than I’d hoped.”)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Ms. Ospina’s process is guided by the idea that most people are petty sometimes, but what separates the average person from the hard-core jerk is the capacity to recognize failures and try to improve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , One of Strategyzer’s founders, Alex Osterwalder, says common jerk qualities are blaming colleagues, refusing feedback and talking about people behind their backs. He believes that screening for nonjerkiness is just as important as looking for technical skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Jerkiness, like incompetency, takes a toll on productivity. And competent jerks who rise through the ranks can have wide-reaching effects, especially in a corporate culture that puts more emphasis on output than on how the work gets done. People get gold stars for performance, not collegiality.                                                                                                                                                               , Baird, the financial services firm, took the principle a step further by codifying it in policy. Employees are informed during their orientation of the company’s “no asshole rule” — it’s even written into training material. Leslie Dixon, the head of human resources, has fired people for violating it.                                                                                                                                                         , “By putting it out there in print and talking about it when they’re onboarded and throughout their career, it fosters a very open conversation about behavior that’s not illegal but that can be uncomfortable,” Ms. Dixon said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Like the team at Strategyzer, the enforcers of Baird’s policy realize rudeness isn’t an immutable trait. People aren’t fired for slip-ups. Even Beth Kavelaris, director of culture and integration at the company, said she got feedback years ago that helped her rethink her own conduct.                                                                                                                                                                          , “It was from my boss, who said, ‘You’ve got to learn to listen better, Beth,’ and I think I interrupted her while she was telling me that,” Ms. Kavelaris recalled. “I’ve gotten better. I haven’t been told that in a long while.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Last month, Mr. Garg, who had fired 900 people over Zoom, posted an apology to his Better.com team. “I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected,” he wrote, and he pledged to do better. The note concluded with a promise to be transparent and share 2022 goals.                                                                                                                                     , His reckoning came at a moment when nearly every company shares the same goal: keeping talent. Nobody can hit metrics if they don’t have a staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , And many are realizing that there’s nothing that thins out a work force like misbehavior. Ms. Darrisaw, for example, of C-Suite Coach, helps companies assess how they can improve their culture. “Are more people trying to leave certain teams?” she asks clients. “That often tells you what the management style is like.”                                                                                                                                        , Sometimes workers can name and shame their meaner colleagues — but in other cases, that job falls to those resigning instead. Which means quitting season might spell trouble for the jerks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Advertisement </td>

Inc. and BMG have acquired the songwriting catalog of John Legend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The deal, disclosed in a regulatory filing, closed last fall and illustrates how red-hot the market for music investments has become. Mr. Legend, at 47 years old—still an active songwriter, recording artist, and performer—is younger and earlier in his career than many of his peers who have been inking deals to help set up their legacies and cash in on their life’s work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The R&amp;B crooner sold his publishing copyrights and the rights to receive royalties from music he penned from 2004 through early 2021. BMG Rights Management and KKR each purchased a 50% stake in the catalog. BMG, which has been administering Mr. Legend’s work since it bought Cherry Lane Music Publishing in 2010, also struck a deal to administer his future compositions, according to a person familiar with the matter. BMG, both a record label and publisher, is a subsidiary of Germany’s Bertelsmann SE.                                                                                                         , JOHN LEGEND GETS INVOLVED IN THE BOOK-PUBLISHING BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , One upshot of KKR and BMG’s investment in Mr. Legend’s work thus far is that his future releases and tours are likely to generate continued attention and streaming of his catalog. The deal encompasses Mr. Legend’s acclaimed 2004 debut album "Get Lifted" as well as hits like "All of Me" and "Love Me Now."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , John Legend appears at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills, California, on Feb. 9, 2020.  ( Associated Press / AP Newsroom)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , KKR last March teamed up with BMG to spend at least $1 billion on music copyrights. That commitment came amid a broader move into music last year for KKR, which last January struck a $200 million deal for a majority stake in Ryan Tedder’s catalog of hits including songs from Beyoncé, Adele, Stevie Wonder and Mr. Tedder’s band, OneRepublic. (Mr. Tedder, now 42 years old, was another relatively young entrant to the market.) In October, KKR spent $1.1 billion on investment advisory firm Kobalt Capital Ltd.’s KMR Music Royalties II portfolio, which includes more than 62,000 copyrights across music genres., CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Together, KKR and BMG last month invested in Texas blues-rock trio ZZ Top’s publishing catalog and recording music royalties in a deal valued around $50 million, according to people familiar with the deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Fueled by strong demand from legacy publishing outfits and financial players alike, as well as low interest rates and tax incentives, an onslaught of artists have been striking deals for their music rights, including Stevie Nicks, Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen. </td>

From day one, my economic agenda has been different.

We have a brand-new approach to our economy. You have generated the first serious bout of inflation in 40 decades. Nice going! This could not have been easy! The Fed has been trying to get inflation above their 2% target for years and years. You just did it in 9 months!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , BIDEN TOUTS UNEMPLOYMENT DECLINE, IGNORES DISAPPOINTING JOB REPORT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Nice going, sir. It's called way too much government spending to boost demand and way too many taxes and regulations to choke-off supply. What you should do in the new year is dump your advisers and make Senator Joe Manchin the chair of your Council of Economic Advisers. Why? Because he was completely right about his high inflation forecast. He's been right all year, and that's why we're saving America, and killing the bill – your $2 trillion boondoggle spending bill last winter contributing mightily to inflation., The Federal Reserve enabled it and distinguished Democratic economists like Larry Summers and Jason Furman told you so, along with Joe Manchin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Now, if you slap on another $5 trillion of spending – which you have tried awfully hard to do but have failed, and will continue to fail – we'll hit double-digit inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , NatWest Markets global economics co-head Michelle Girard analyzes the December jobs report on 'Making Money.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , You're right, sir. You have triggered a fundamentally new approach to our economy, a big inflation which inevitably will lead to a big recession in a couple of years. So, thank you for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Maybe you can haul out Vice President Kamala Harris, who will put your new economic thinking in the same historical pantheon as Pearl Harbor and 9/11.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , STEVE MOORE BLAMES POOR JOB REPORT ON EXPANSION OF WELFARE PROGRAMS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Now, as for your attack on supply-side growth economics, I invite your attention to some actual factoids in a recent piece by Trump economic advisers Kevin Hassett and Tyler Goodspeed. Using government factoids, they note that in 2019 alone real median household income rose by $4,400 - a bigger increase in one year than even the combined totals during the Bush and Obama administrations.

The people said the company, home of meme-stock message board WallStreetBets and countless others, could be valued at as much as $15 billion in an initial public offering. Reddit announced in December it had confidentially filed for an IPO.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Oil prices ended lower on Friday, but finished the week higher as traders kept an eye on unrest in Kazakhstan. Should any significant amount of production from the country be lost, "the bull market in oil will be extended," said Michael Lynch, president at Strategic Energy &amp; Economic Research. However, "OPEC+ is unlikely to react to such a loss unless it is clear that it will be lengthy and global inventories would thus continue to decline." February West Texas Intermediate crude

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Swiss franc traded at 0.918 per USD, appreciating from the 2-week low of 0.923 touched on January 7th, amid a weaker dollar after release of US labor market data. Non-farm payrolls increased by 199 thousand in December, largely missing expectations of around 400 thousand added jobs. Still, the franc started the year subdued against both the euro and the dollar, as the Fed and the ECB point to outlooks of tighter monetary policy. During the FOMC’s meeting, Federal Reserve policymakers indicated that stimulus could be cut back faster than previously thought, with potential rate hikes coming in March followed by a possible balance sheet rundown. Meanwhile, the ECB slowed the pace of the pandemic emergency purchase programme in January and confirmed its conclusion in the end of March. On the other hand, the SNB has yet not signaled any policy tightening, as domestic inflation is still well below those of its main trading partners. </td>

If you can’t get a price quote and you don’t want to make the early decision pledge, you don’t get to avail yourself of the better admissions odds that often exist when you apply that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Enter Northeastern University in Boston, a prime example of a popular school that does not always predict how much aid many applicants will get — an amount that could swing the final price by $100,000 or more during the undergraduate years. While examining its website in recent weeks, I also noticed that a key statistic that college shoppers need when assessing their odds of aid seemed off by at least 20 percentage points.                                        , Northeastern, which has transformed itself from a commuter school into a highly rejective one in just a few decades, is not alone. Connecticut College’s and New York University’s mechanisms for predicting prices have similar shortcomings. Last month, at my urging, N.Y.U. took down an admissions office blog post that was filled with incorrect early decision information.                                                                                               , All of this muck highlights a persistent problem in too many of the upper echelons of the undergraduate education industry: When it comes time to make this enormous, emotional purchase, all too often you don’t get to know before you apply and get in what the price will actually be.                                                                                                                                                                                        , So what are we talking about when we talk about the price discounts that come from “aid” and college shoppers’ ability to predict it? Schools don’t always make it clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , First, there is aid that schools base on the financial need that a student or family demonstrates. In this category, families get a fair bit of assistance in determining what might come their way. The federal government requires schools to offer something called a net price calculator, and it predicts what kind of assistance a college might offer people who can’t afford to pay the full price.                                                                       , The other big type of aid that institutions offer has come to be known as merit aid. It is murkier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Plenty of affluent families that don’t qualify for need-based aid get merit aid anyhow. Many of them believe that they can’t afford the retail price without some merit aid. Cry them a river, but if you earn $300,000 a year and live in an expensive area, writing a $75,000 tuition check, after taxes, may not be easy. Schools know this, which is part of the reason most of them offer merit aid.                                                                         , Some colleges will predict what merit aid you might get — which they determine by figuring out if they like your grades and test scores or other things about your application — before you sign an early decision agreement. Others, like Northeastern, will not do that in their net price calculators.                                                                                                                                                                         , Why not? One big reason, according to Sundar Kumarasamy, Northeastern’s vice president of enrollment management, is that these calculators are able to put test scores and grades through some rubric or another to define and predict merit aid — but they have qualitative limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                         , “How would a student who has an art portfolio compete with a person who knows how math and science work and tests well?” Mr. Kumarasamy said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , This is reasonable, but it’s also pretty frustrating for families that just want to know — within six figures, at least! — what they might end up paying over four or five years. Whitman College in Washington and the College of Wooster in Ohio make a virtue — and a marketing strategy, really — of counseling individual families that want an early read on what kind of merit aid their applications might get.                                                           , Oberlin College in Ohio estimates merit aid via its net price calculator. Schools like Wabash College and the University of Alabama display their merit-aid-awarding grids for all to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , It’s not a great look for Northeastern when it tells the world on its merit aid page that “students who are in the top 10-15% of our applicant pool are considered for competitive merit aid awards.” When I first read that figure a few weeks ago, I could tell from the school’s own published data that the percentage of undergraduates who do receive merit aid was higher than that figure might suggest.                                                                  , I asked, just to be sure, and 36 percent of first-year students who have not demonstrated financial need still get merit aid. In the wake of my inquiry, Northeastern updated the website to reflect these odds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Northeastern’s use of the term “binding” when it comes to early decision doesn’t strike me as quite right, either. In italics on its website, it instructs people: “​​Please note, Early Decision is binding — if you are admitted, you are committed to attending.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                , But you aren’t. This isn’t a contract that schools try to enforce through some kind of legal mechanism, and each year, 2 to 3 percent of the people who get into Northeastern via early decision decline the offer, mostly for financial reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Early decision isn’t binding, and Northeastern should say so on its website, using those same italics that are already there. (It is indeed as plain as day on one of the actual early decision agreements the school eventually asks students, high school counselors and parents to sign.)                                                                                                                                                                                      , And just to be crystal clear, if you don’t get the merit aid that you feel you need to make the numbers work, some schools will let you walk away from an early decision admittance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “Any student who applies, is admitted ED and finds the financial aid award (need-based or merit-based aid or a combination of both) to be unreasonable has every right to withdraw their application at Conn and pursue higher education options elsewhere,” Andrew Strickler, the dean of admission and financial aid at Connecticut College, said via email. “I fervently support a student’s ability to discontinue their candidacy at Conn under these circumstances.”        , If you’re a student or parent stumbling through the college shopping process, you should take that fervent support as a kind of cue. You are not a supplicant here; you are a consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , So how would Northeastern feel if you walked away from an early decision acceptance if you didn’t get any merit aid — and thus felt that you couldn’t afford the school?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , When I first posed this question to Mr. Kumarasamy, he suggested that it was a kind of gamesmanship. I objected to that, given that plenty of people don’t feel they can afford his $75,000 or so list price but can make it work at $50,000 with that merit aid discount. How can this be gaming the system, I asked, when he doesn’t give them any sense ahead of time of whether they might get that $25,000 off?                                                              , Eventually, he came around. “What is not good for the student is not good for any of us,” he said. But he was also quick to point out the zero-sum nature of early decision; if you bail out on an acceptance, you took the spot of someone else — perhaps someone even needier than you — who would have liked a shot at getting in early in the senior year of high school and actually accepting the school’s financial aid offer.                                             , “There’s a difference between behavior that occurs in rare instances and behavior we want to encourage,” a Northeastern spokesman, Michael Armini, said via email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , I would like to encourage that behavior a bit more than Northeastern does, and I wish college counselors in high schools would, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , It would be so much easier if none of this parsing was necessary, but early decision is going to be with us for a while because colleges like it so much. When enrollment managers (as they now often refer to themselves) admit a large fraction of a class at a point in the process where students feel obliged to go if they get in, it gives the schools great control over precisely what sorts of students are in any given class — and how much revenue they will deliver., So as long as we’re stuck with a highly imperfect system, schools should say what percentage of students get merit aid in the early decision round, if they have one and also offer merit aid. All schools should also say what percentage of the overall class gets merit aid and explain how they’re defining the term.                                                                                                                                                         , They should say that early decision is not binding, and they should pledge not to punish future applicants from high schools where former applicants walked away from an early decision acceptance. They should also clarify whether they have a problem with people who decline an early decision offer because they didn’t get enough merit aid.                                                                                                                                , Finally, if they won’t predict merit aid in their net price calculators, they should explain why, and give people more information about why some people get that aid and others don’t.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , I shouldn’t have to say all of this, or any of it, really. I shouldn’t have to revise their websites for them in successive columns. And you shouldn’t have to go into this process — and come out of it, in many instances — having no idea how the system actually works.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Advertisement </td>

Domestically, the Swiss National Bank remains committed to its ultra-loose monetary policy, as December labor data indicated a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 2.6%. While the Swiss inflation rate is at its highest since 2008 at 1.5%, the SNB indicated it does not have plans to tighten policy before other major central banks. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has invited President Joe Biden to give his first State of the Union address on March 1, the California Democrat said Friday. In a letter to Biden, Pelosi called the past year "historic" and said she is inviting the president to "share your vision of the State of the Union." Biden spoke before a joint session of Congress in April 2021, but the March 1 speech will be his first formal State of the Union address.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Hiring in the US slowed last month, as firms struggled to hire workers and continued to grapple with the effects of coronavirus.                                                                                                                      , Employers hired just 199,000 people in December, a second month of weaker than expected gains.                                                                                                                                                        , But the jobless rate dropped sharply to 3.9% and wages rose, the Labor Department said.                                                                                                                                                               , The mixed data, which was collected before Omicron's full force was felt, follows a record year of jobs growth.                                                                                                                                       , "For a second straight month, we have conflicting pictures emerging," said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. "This report appears to reflect the state of play before the worst impacts of the Omicron variant hit the economy." , "We will have to wait until the following report, covering the job market picture in January, to get a clearer picture," he added.                                                                                                                    , The US added more than 6.4 million jobs in 2021, regaining many of the positions lost at the height of the pandemic in 2020.                                                                                                                          , Though total employment remains about 3.6 million lower than its pre-pandemic level - and far lower than it would have been if Covid had not struck - many signs point to a strong economy.                                                           , A record 4.5 million Americans quit jobs in November - a sign of confidence in the labour market - and more than 10 million positions stand open, the government reported this week. Jobless claims have dropped to a near 50-year low.               , "I could hire three full-timers and one part-timer on the spot," said Konstantinos Tsoulos, owner of Brothers Bagels in Brooklyn, New York.                                                                                                           , In September, he decided to close the shop on Mondays due to the staff shortage. He said he has not had a single person inquire about a job.                                                                                                          , "I've been in business almost 35 years and I've never seen anything like it," he said.                                                                                                                                                                , December's job gains were felt across most industries, led by leisure and hospitality. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% from 4.2%, while average hourly earnings were up 4.7% year-on-year.                                                         , US President Joe Biden called the figures "historic", saying they reflected an economy back on its feet thanks to a flood of government spending championed by his administration.                                                                    , Wells Fargo economist Sarah House said future growth would be determined by worker availability.                                                                                                                                                      , "December's report underscored that workers are only likely to trickle back into the jobs market as reasons for sitting out, like financial cushions, health concerns and childcare issues do not unwind all at once," she said.                      , The labour shortages have helped to push inflation in the US to its highest rate in almost 40 years.                                                                                                                                                  , In response, America's central bank has signalled it plans to start removing support for the economy, raising interest rates potentially as soon as March.                                                                                            , But the emergence of the Omicron variant has complicated the outlook for the economy.                                                                                                                                                                 , The virus has been blamed for widespread worker absences in recent weeks, prompting the cancellation of thousands of flights, the closure of major school districts and strains on hospitals, transport systems and other businesses.                 , Mr Tsoulos said his business has been holding on thanks to patronage from neighbourhood families. But he is worried by the shift to remote working, which has cut into his commuter business and the catering orders he used to receive from offices. , "Everybody was touting that the downtown office buildings would open after Labor Day and nothing happened. Then they said January and it's almost mid-January," he said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index closed 0.3% down at 73,940 on Friday, as investors continued to expect faster interest rates increases by the Federal Reserve even after latest economic data pointed to a slowdown in US jobs growth in December. On the domestic economic front, South Africa Absa Manufacturing PMI dropped in December, pointing to a slower expansion in manufacturing activity, as a surge in Covid-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant and tighter global restrictions weighed on the country's exports. On a brighter note, Mauritius reopened to travellers from South Africa, and eight other previously restricted countries, three weeks ahead of schedule. Mauritius follows France, Germany, and the US in announcing eased travel restrictions on South Africa. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB erased early gains to close 0.1% lower at 27,618 on Friday, slightly extending last session’s 1.8% loss, as investors digested consumer price data from the Eurozone and labor market data from the United States. Consumer inflation in the euro area rose to 5% in December according to preliminary data, the highest ever recorded. At the same time, 199 thousand jobs were added to the US economy, less than half of market expectations. On the corporate front, industrial stocks led the losses, driven by recently demerged Cnh Industrial (-1.6%) and Iveco Group (-2.9%). Luxury clothing also traded on the red, led by Brunello Cucinelli (-3.2%) and Moncler (-2.8%). On the other hand, STMicroelectronics jumped 3.7% after publishing preliminary expectations of USD 3.56 billion in net revenue, 11.2% higher than the corresponding period in the previous year and 140bps above the upper limit of the firm’s reported range. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Consumer prices in Ecuador rose1.94 percent over a year in December of 2021, accelerating from a 1.84 percent rise in the previous month. It was the highest inflation rate since March of 2016 as prices accelerated for food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.08 percent vs 0.59 percent); transport (9.77 percent vs 9.52 percent); housing and utilities (0.57 percent vs 0.17 percent); furnishings (2.24 percent vs 1.70 percent); and education ( 2.76 percent vs 2.71 percent). Also, prices fell less for clothing and footwear (-3.20 percent vs -3.73 percent). Meanwhile inflation slowed for healthcare (1.62 percent vs 2.09 percent); and restaurants and hotels (0.65 percent vs 0.78 percent).

At the same time, concerns mounted that the spread of the pandemic could cause labour shortage in rubber farms. Meanwhile, the imports from China are set to pick ahead of the week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year as factories are building up inventories to address seasonal supply shortage coinciding with the annual wintering of rubber trees in major producing countries. Rubber lost nearly 18% in 2021 as demand from the auto sector declined due to chip shortages and COVID-19 restrictions imposed especially across Europe and top buyer China. </td>

In the meantime, US job growth in the last month of 2021 came at less than half of the market’s expectations.

UK house prices in December were 9.8% higher than a year earlier, the sharpest annual increase since July 2007, while a PMI survey suggested the country's construction sector growth eased to a three-month low as the rapid spread of Omicron had an impact on the economic recovery.

At the same time, economic sentiment in the Eurozone weakened to a seven-month low, while industrial production in Germany and France unexpectedly contracted in November. Elsewhere, the US jobs report showed a decline in the unemployment rate and an acceleration in wage growth, making the case for faster interest rate hikes by the Fed this year. On the corporate front, Deutsche Bank climbed to a more than six-month high, after the company's finance chief said it was confident it will reach a key profitability target this year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cruise stocks surge, after Stifel analyst says 2022 will be the 'Year of the Cruise!' - MarketWatch </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Shares of cruise operators rallied Friday, to buck the broad-market selloff, after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Steven Wieczynski pounded the table on the group, saying 2022 was going to be known as the "Year of the Cruise!" Shares of Royal Caribbean Group 
        RCL,
        +3.98%,
       which Wieczynski said was his "top idea for 2022," climbed 3.6%; Carnival Corp. 
        CCL,
        +3.94%
       rallied 2.9%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. 
        NCLH,
        +4.03%
       rose 3.6%; Lindblad Expeditions Holdings Inc. 
        LIND,
        +2.47%
       tacked on 1.9%; while the S&amp;P 500 
        SPX,
        -0.41%
       dropped 0.6%. Wieczynski said for investors searching for recovery names that "massively underperformed" last year, he believes cruise-related names will stick out as compelling ideas. "[W]e are believers that cruise demand should remain strong throughout the majority of 2022," Wieczynski wrote in a note to clients. "While there certainly will be cancellations and itinerary adjustments in 1H22 due to COVID noise, we still believe that cruise operators are on a clear path (although might be delayed) to the all-important cash flow breakeven/positive level.", After another year of underperformance versus the S&amp;P 500, AT&amp;T Inc.'s "bear case" may have mostly played itself out, according to an analyst.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

Still, the currency remains subdued amid successively negative revisions for the economic growth in 2022. In 2021, analysts even projected a GDP growth of 2.5% for this year, although, after shocks, expectations have receded to 0.36%. In addition, an increasing political uncertainty has driven investors away from the real as the general elections of 2022 approach, polls are showing that the left-wing PT is increasingly likely to win, while fiscal concerns increased after populist policies from Bolsonaro. </td>

Consumer inflation in the euro area rose to 5% on the year during December, according to preliminary estimates, surpassing market expectations for another record high. Domestically, inflation stood at 2.8% in December, the highest reading in 13 years.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Mexican peso traded below 20.45 per USD in the first week of January, the strongest since early November after the central bank minutes showed that the policymakers remain concerned over inflation and triggering expectations of a continuation in the tightening cycle. In its last meeting, Banxico surprised the markets and hiked the rates by 50 bps to 5.5%, above expectations of 25 bps saying inflation risk balance has deteriorated, with both the headline inflation and the core inflation expectations for the next year increasing again, and the ones for the medium-term remaining above the target. Still, new inflation figures showed that consumer prices rose 7.36% in December, slipping from a 20-year high of 7.37% hit in November, well above the Banxico target of 3% plus or minus one percentage point. Also, rising oil prices and a recovery in risk appetite as traders hope omicron disruptions will not derail growth helped to boost further gains in the currency. </td>

In Canada, the unemployment data reached a new pandemic low of 5.9% in December, while the economy added 54.7 thousand jobs in December of 2021, following a 153.7 thousand gain in November and above market expectations of 27.5 thousand driven by gains in the goods-producing sector (+44,000). Also, the dollar index fell to below 96 after mixed economic data showed the US unemployment rate dropped more than expected in December and wage growth accelerated, while non-farm payrolls missed forecasts. Meanwhile, investors remained optimistic as studies showed that the Omicron variant is less severe than previous strains, albeit more infectious, gearing up them to bet that the economic recovery will not derail. A more robust economic recovery strengthens the appeal for higher rates from the BoC. </td>

Exports jumped 29.4 percent year-on-year to USD 40.72 billion after reaching a record high in October and beating market forecasts of a 26.7 percent rise, mainly driven by electronic products (+27.5 percent); information, communication and audio-video products (+22.4 percent); and base metals and articles of base metal (+28.5 percent). At the same time, imports advanced 28.1 percent to USD 34.95 billion and slower than market estimates of a 30.6 percent rise, led by purchases of electronic parts (+25 percent); mineral products (+114.3 percent), particularly petroleum (150.7 percent) and machinery (+5.3 percent). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European stocks were mostly flat to lower Friday as investors digested a batch of economic data from the Eurozone and the US. The bloc's inflation rate likely jumped to a record high of 5% in December, beating market expectations of 4.7% and remaining above the ECB's target for a sixth straight month. At the same time, economic sentiment in the Eurozone weakened to a seven-month low, while industrial production in Germany and France unexpectedly contracted in November. Elsewhere, the US jobs report showed a decline in the unemployment rate and an acceleration in wage growth, making the case for faster interest rate hikes by the Fed this year. On the corporate front, Deutsche Bank climbed to a more than six-month high, after the company's finance chief said it was confident it will reach a key profitability target this year. Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics also jumped to the top of the STOXX 600, after its preliminary fourth-quarter revenue came in slightly above forecasts. </td>

At the same time, persistent shipping bottleneck caused by Covid-19 restrictions, rising global demand, higher costs of fertilizers and fuels and ongoing labor shortages should continue to exert upward pressure on coffee prices. The US Department of Agriculture in its latest report forecasts world coffee production for 2021/2022 to fall by 8.5 million bags from the previous year to 167.5 million primarily due to a drop in Brazil’s coffee production. Global consumption is seen rising 1.5 million to 164.9 million bags in the same period. </td>

Still, bullion is set for a 2% weekly drop on bets for earlier and faster interest-rate increases than previously expected following the latest Fed minutes. Fed officials said that the “very tight” labor market might warrant raising rates sooner than expected and showed the central bank discussed reducing its balance sheet in another move to aggressively dial back pandemic-era stimulus. Although investors view gold as a hedge against inflation, higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. </td>

Market sentiment was also pressured by weaker domestic data. South Africa Absa Manufacturing PMI dropped in December, pointing to a slower expansion in manufacturing activity, as a surge in Covid-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant and tighter global restrictions weighed on the country's exports. On a brighter note, Mauritius reopened to travellers from South Africa, and eight other previously restricted countries, three weeks ahead of schedule.

meanwhile our fave ex Presidente aka Scummy is calling  his buddy Sean Hannity scum of the Earth as Sean who was part of the pre -Jan 6th party shared his phone texts with the Meadows gang and likely others.

Apparently hypocritical Sean had second thoughts about being involved in the nasty scheme which had been well planned for weeks.  Wonder why he doesn&amp;#39;t discuss his own Jan 6th dealings on his hilarious snarky show? 

The good news is that some of the old MAGA sycophants are turning on Trumpy and his god- awful crew of liars and dividers. Maybe, just maybe there will be some semblance of humanity in the next decade, if not, we are all in trouble especially our kids who are committing suicide at unprecedented rates. Lost youth is so sad and tragic.

There is a whole group of unhinged cowards out there that need a rope around their necks just to wake them up to become a human being for the good of all of us. Tic tic tic

Hug your children. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The general belief is once interest rates go up the market will crash. As if we didn&amp;#39;t know this from the beginning interest rates at some point would go up. I&amp;#39;m not one to try and call bottoms, but I feel fairly confident interest rates hike solidifies the bottom for growth stocks. If not, many will be trading below cash on hand, that would be equal to if not worse than dot com bubble. 71% stocks on Nasdaq are down 20%+.  
 
Assuming this is true, $WISH will organically go up along with many other growth stocks because its &amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;. Back in 2009 markets bottomed in the worst economic conditions. Market is also forward looking which would make sense that the last 11 months were leading towards this event. Just my opinion. $SPY $QQQ </td>

If you think JPow cares about you then by ll means bet against the Suits and Hedgies, see how that works out for you. The days of YOLO HODL and MEME nonsense is over. If you got hopium in your trading strategies without risk management from real time analysis and proper hedging to mitigate loss then you deserve what&amp;#39;s coming.

There will NOT be any recovery, there will be no bail out. The market doesn&amp;#39;t care you impersonating as Warren Buffet o close minded snowflake who uses block features to cope with reality.

We been in Bear Market since mid 2021 and if you think otherwise because artificially propped up Indices by few FAANGs with insane valuations which doesn&amp;#39;t match its fundamentals even then this crash is needed to wipe you out. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The general belief is once interest rates go up the market will crash. As if we didn&amp;#39;t know this from the beginning interest rates at some point would go up. I&amp;#39;m not one to try and call bottoms, but I feel fairly confident interest rates hike solidifies the bottom for growth stocks. If not, many will be trading below cash on hand, that would be equal to if not worse than dot com bubble. 71% stocks on Nasdaq are down 20%+.  
 
Assuming this is true, $WISH will organically go up along with many other growth stocks because its &amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;. Back in 2009 markets bottomed in the worst economic conditions. Market is also forward looking which would make sense that the last 11 months were leading towards this event. Just my opinion. $SPY $QQQ </td>

More fun ahead. It looks like there is no real need to protect ourselves from the COVID 19 virus anymore. 

 Skip the masks, skip those vaccination mandates, feel free to embrace strangers with full upper body hugs because the sooner we can get COVID, the sooner we can put an end to this global dilemma. Now wouldn&amp;#39;t that be worth it? Time will tell.

Meanwhile back at the Ranch, the fight for this and that continues from both sides in attempts to somewhat stem the spread.

I get a kick of the in- your- face anti-vaxxers who died from COVID 19 in the last year. Yeah, that didn&amp;#39;t work out too well for them and actually thousands who followed their flawed well spoken directives. Yeah, losing loved ones at the hands of others spitting in your face is just not cool. Even the possibility of death is not a deterrent!  

I would love to see this nasty virus come to a global end by July 4th but if it doesn&amp;#39;t, we may be going South at a much quicker rate than most thought.

Stay safe </td>

that 50 years ago 
 
everyone believed in eugenics, and was praised for their support 
(all the ivy league university professors, capitalists, presidents, politicians.  heck, even that blind girl Helen Keller, as well as Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood) 
 
that today 
 
no one believes in eugenics, and is ruthlessly shamed if they do.

1. Sitting at support
2. Trip bottom
3. RSI (5)  oversold and near long term support 
4. Earnings season 

Deprecating factors:
1. Declining momentum
2. Double top
3. Usually bounces off lower BBands which in this case would break triple bottom support and trigger Algo selling.

I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for over a year now. This guy is RIGHT ON THE MARK! 
 
&amp;quot;Is that a scenario you see? The Fed will attempt to tighten, the equity market will revolt and the Fed will back down again? 
 
Yes. Everything in their track record suggests that. Remember in 2018, when Jerome Powell came in and said I don’t care if equity markets fall, we need to normalize monetary policy? Well, within six weeks in late 2018, the market fell by 18%, and Powell backed off.&amp;quot;

This guy is right on with FED, Inflation, financial markets, etc. All that matters to the markets is FED FREE MONEY LIQUIDITY and inflation be damned! 
 
&amp;quot;At the end of the day, markets don’t really care about economic numbers. They care about policy. Last year, we had accelerating inflation, but the policy framework stayed the same, with very easy fiscal and monetary policy in the US, the Eurozone and Japan. So markets just continued to rip higher.&amp;quot; 
 
 
&amp;quot;For now, what the Fed is presenting us is that a faster tapering is hawkish. Well no, a faster tapering just means they are being less dovish. They are still injecting liquidity, just at lower amounts.&amp;quot;

Will policymakers really tighten significantly? 
 
&amp;quot;My inclination is that they won’t. They just can’t. If the Fed tightens too much, they will end up with an equity market and a real estate crash. I think the Fed will try to continue on the side of always being late. And this is based on my core belief that today’s inflation rate is not a bug. It’s a feature. It’s what they want. It’s how you deal with an excessive amount of debt. So they will say they are worried about inflation, but deep down, all the policy settings were put in place to get this result. It’s just like the 1950s and 1960s: You know, we came out of World War II with very high levels of debt to GDP, and we took care of it through 15 years of negative real rates. It’s the same plan this time around.&amp;quot;

January 9, 2007
 
On this day in 2007, the first iPhone was announced by Steve Jobs. The new phone combined “three products—a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, and a breakthrough Internet communications device,” in one. Just 12 years later, the iPhone’s enormous success allowed Apple to become the first publicly-traded company with a market value of $1 trillion. And on Jan. 3, 2022, it became the world&amp;#39;s first $3 trillion company.

Market participants are bracing for another historically hot reading on inflation in the latest CPI data, due out on Wednesday. On a year-over-year basis, consumer prices likely surged by 7.1% in December, based on Bloomberg consensus data, accelerating even further from November&amp;#39;s 6.8% year-over-year clip. This would mark the fastest rate since 1982, when CPI rose as much as 8.4% on a year-over-year basis.  - Yahoo </td>

A PTON bike is what? $3,000?

Definitely the start of the slow, agonizing death spiral here. 

I don&amp;#39;t think PTON will go out of business. No way. They have a small group of hardcore fans. The same fans that probably love $AAPL and $TSLA . 

I think either Apple, Google, Amazon, or possibly Netflix will buy them out within 12-24 months. 

The stock will probably drop to $20-$25, management will know it&amp;#39;s done, and sell to Apple, Google, Amazon, or Netflix for $25-$40 per share. </td>

Didn’t you know that when the stock is oversold already .. 

You will noticed that puts has shifted already to become more expensive and more discouraging for people to buy puts and will focus on buying calls.

You see why calls premiums are already very cheap already.

It’s not just theta ..

The pattern is already shown big consolidation with big up and down swing to make options very cheap.

Now with oversold territory has been touched for all levels.

You know what that means .. it has reset to October bottom trend and is on the upward trend to 200 to 210 oversold territory trend.

This is very bullish indication! Let’s go!! </td>

Now to me a long term investor is already doing this,  but a DAY TRADER , or, yeah, swing too, of course, maybe, more so, is not just holding a stock for YEARS.

Apple is a $3 Trillion Stock – Week in Review
January 9, 2022. 

Apple (AAPL) was briefly a $3 trillion stock on January 4th, the first day the stock market opened in 2022. The stock price climbed over $182.86 per share on optimism about an electric vehicle, augmented-reality glasses, and other products. Alas, Apple’s stock price dropped the remainder of the week as a negative sentiment about rising interest rates impacted tech stocks and the NASDAQ. Apple’s market capitalization finished the week at $2.824 trillion.

THE POWER OF HEADLINES 
 
Headlines usually lead the way in changing market sentiment. But oftentimes these headlines also serve as indicators for contrarian investing. A study conducted by Paul Montgomery in the early ’80s found that if an investor followed the direction of the headlines in the stock market, he would usually be right for 30 days after the announcement. However, the direction would be wrong for the subsequent 11 months after the announcement in 80% of cases. As an investor, you would have been right 80% of the time by investing contradictory to the headlines 30 days after the publication for a period of 11 months. </td>

Remember to comment and/or like any charts that you want to see again next week.  The charts that get little to no love I&amp;#39;ll have to assume nobody cares about and those tickers will run the risk of being left off of the 100 charts in 60 minutes next week.  So, let&amp;#39;s get the conversation started and have some fun!

Side Note:  Last week I was unable to complete the 100 charts in 60 minutes.  It actually took me 90 minutes.  This week I actually 107 charts to post.  What are the odds I can complete it in 60 minutes???  Place your bets.  LOL </td>

Take that in conjunction with what a long time industry insider, with ties to UofA and formerly $AMAT said to his almost 5k LinkedIn followers. It really does make you wonder. 

STMicro is supplying Telsa and $AAPL   as we know for a fact, and we also know for a fact that Atomera has been working with ST Micro for many years now. I have said said epiphany here is likely going to be spectacular and transformational. Sure continues to be a lot of smoke for no  🔥.

My thoughts on the stock mkt next week ... 

Last Sunday in my Game Plan for the Week sent to members I laid out the scenario that ended up playing out all week (go to renohawk.blog to read).  I mentioned we would probably begin the year with a move to 480 on the SPY but that would most likely be our last leg higher. It was my belief that yields were going to rise and the first half of the year would most likely offer a 10%+ correction. I said last Sunday that we would breach the 50 day EMA (which we closed at Friday) and test our 200 day EMA. 

In the past I&amp;#39;ve used BTC/cryptos as well as TSLA as my sentiment indicators. And while TSLA (as well stks like AAPL) has held up well, the crypto mkt has been crumbling with an enormous amount of new investors  wiped out. 

Where to from here? Do we bounce? My new Game Plan goes out tomorrow. To join, email me at:

About Tim Cook increased compensation package - people want to know how he get increased package.

Usually the shareholder decided that, not Tim Cook himself by proxy voting.

How does that work? Proxy sent the document of increased compensation  and they do by voting thru proxy.

Who is the largest shareholder in this? It’s of course Warren Buffet.

Now what is going to be secret is ?

Share buyback and dividend increases ..

Who decides that ? Of course, shareholder proxy votes.

I can sense these both share buybacks and dividends will increase this time due to record breaking sales.

The purpose of these is to dampen the P/E to make it very reasonably valued.

This is a must buy stock for long term holding due to metaverse and apple car coming soon.

Think long, not short term! </td>

If you want to understand finance analysis.

P/E determine the valuations of the company if it’s overvalued or not.

You formulate that with current price / annual earning per share

AAPL current price is 172 and the annual EPS is 5.61 which means 1.4 per quarter.

Now formulate that current EPS

172 / 5.61 = 30.65 

That is currently reasonably valued given they had two criteria

- share buybacks
- dividends 

If the company decides to increases both, it will attract many investors to buy and accumulate.

This is good for long and hold.

So people who say this stock is overvalued is wrong and know nothing about financial terminology. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $TSLA After Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Tesla on Sunday, Tesla stock price has received another boost after other Street analysts joined to share new positive catalysts concerning the EV titan.

According to Global Equities, Tesla has started the new year in the same manner as it ended 2021 - with massive deliveries. Chowdry says that production, shipping, and delivery activity looks “extremely strong” at the start of the new quarter.

“Delivery activity on January 7, 2022 was even more stronger than what we saw on December 28, 2021.. 2 to 3 Model S/X Plaid on almost every Shipping Truck leaving the Factory.. Shipping trucks heading towards 880, 680, thereby indicating, shipments towards East and North of Fremont Factory,” 

Wedbush’s Daniel Ives noted that Tesla is likely to start Model Y production at its Giga Austin factory over the next 7-10 days. His remarks come two days after several UK customers of Tesla were told that deliveries could start in early 2022. </td>

After Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) on Sunday, Tesla stock price has received another boost after other Street analysts joined to share new positive catalysts concerning the EV titan.

According to Global Equities Research’s Trip Chowdry, Tesla has started the new year in the same manner as it ended 2021 - with massive deliveries. Chowdry says that production, shipping, and delivery activity looks “extremely strong” at the start of the new quarter.

“Delivery activity on January 7, 2022 was even more stronger than what we saw on December 28, 2021.. 2 to 3 Model S/X Plaid on almost every Shipping Truck leaving the Factory.. Shipping trucks heading towards 880, 680, thereby indicating, shipments towards East and North of Fremont Factory,”

“We believe that Tesla, given its leadership position in EVs (including its vertical integration and tight coupling of hardware and software, as well as its ecosystem of charging stations and brand), and its focus on clean transportation more broadly (given its solar and storage businesses) will be best positioned to capitalize on the long-term shift to EVs. We expect Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term as it ramps the important Model Y product as well as new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas, and in the long-term as it increases its mix of software revenue. We see upside to FactSet consensus estimates in the next few years,” Delaney wrote in his client note. </td>

That means more Model Y crossover vehicles—and, just as important, that the Cybertruck will be arriving on U.S. roads shortly.

“Based on our analysis of Giga Austin it appears paperwork is now clearing the way for Model Y production starting over the next 7 to 10 days,” wrote Ives. “Launching the Austin production in early January is very important to Tesla expanding both domestic and global production of Model Y’s which are set to have a massive year in 2022.”

Tesla Cars are appreciating assets - if you bought FSD 2 yrs ago you are already up 50% on your 8k purchase !! 

The car value is already more by at least 10-20% -incredible!! 

If you bought any other EV or legacy your car is likely lost 40-50% of its value or been recalled !! 

It’s as simple as that !
