That prompted the U.S.D.A. to warn that the suspension would “remain in place for as long as necessary to ensure the appropriate actions are taken” to secure the safety of inspection service personnel working in Mexico., On Friday, the department said in a statement that it worked with agencies in Mexico to enact more safety measures for its inspectors. It did not elaborate on those measures.                                                                                                                                                           , “The safety of U.S.D.A. employees simply doing their jobs is of paramount importance,” the department said. “U.S.D.A. is appreciative of the positive, collaborative relationship between the United States and Mexico that made resolution of this issue possible in a timely manner.”                                                  , The ban had been expected to negatively affect the western state of Michoacán in Mexico, the only region approved in Mexico to send avocados to the United States.                                                                                                                                                                       , Annual exports there total nearly $3 billion, with the bulk going to the United States, where 80 percent of the avocados consumed come from Mexico and the average price of $1.43 an avocado was already nearly 11 percent higher than a year ago.                                                                                       , Details of the threat made to the employee were not made public. However, the avocado industry has attracted the interest in the past decade of drug cartels, which have become more fragmented and sought ways to diversify their illicit income streams.                                                                               , The Association of Avocado Exporting Producers and Packers of Mexico, which represents 29,000 avocado farmers and 65 packing houses in Michoacán, said in a statement on Friday that it proposed the creation of an “intelligence and security unit” within the association that would “support the export program.”                     , Both countries agreed to the proposal, which also included a security plan from the government of Michoacán, though specifics of that plan were not released.                                                                                                                                                                            , Armando López Orduña, the director general of the association, thanked Mexico and the United States, saying that their support had avoided, “to the extent possible, the impact on supply.”                                                                                                                                              , The export of Mexican avocados to the United States is set to resume on Monday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The ban came just before one of the biggest events for the avocado industry, the Super Bowl. Concerns had been growing over whether the ban would affect the industry’s other big day in the year, Cinco de Mayo.                                                                                                                        , Mark Davidson, an administrator at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s plant protection and quarantine program, said in a statement that all parties were glad to see a resolution.                                                                                                                                         , “The popularity of Mexican avocados is undeniable,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Advertisement </td>

The next day, the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti published a report that claimed, without proof, that a stash of chemical weapons had been given to Ukraine by the United States, according to the researchers.                                                                                                                                                                                , Throughout January and February, the researchers said, Russian-backed media spread the rumor, which was amplified on social media. “Chemical weapons are already present on the territory of Ukraine,” said a message in one anonymous Telegram channel with 24,500 followers. The post was viewed by 7,000 people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Russian state media has been spreading rumors that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are planning an attack on Donbas, the separatist region in eastern Ukraine, with the help of American, British and Polish mercenaries, according to the researchers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The rumor then spread on Facebook and YouTube. “The Ukrainian people are waiting for Mother Russia to free their younger sister from the Nazis and the State Department,” said one Facebook post that collected nearly 100 likes. On YouTube, a video spreading the same unproven claim collected more than 31,600 views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , In this narrative, the Russians accuse the Ukrainians and Americans of planting a false flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Since Jan. 30, all 15 of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants have been generating electricity, marking the longest stretch of full utilization of nuclear energy in the country. That comes as Ukraine’s authorities decided to disconnect from the power grid with Belarus and the Russian Federation and implemented the plan to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Russian state media began to spread the idea that Ukraine was overestimating its ability to keep up with its energy needs, and that the country’s nuclear facilities were in dire need of repair. The Russian media implied that Western countries could be organizing to attack the nuclear facilities and place the blame on Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , On Feb. 12, a Telegram channel with over 15,000 followers posted that the British Special Air Service was preparing an attack on one of Ukraine’s power plants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , And on Feb. 15, the Telegram channel of a Russian war correspondent, Aleksander Kots, alleged that Ukraine had asked for special equipment from the United States to help mitigate a possible natural disaster, including to help with radiation and chemical fallout, according to the researchers. Mr. Kots added the unfounded accusation that the Ukrainians were devising a false-flag event — accusing Russia of preparing a terrorist attack against a nuclear power plant.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, a longtime associate of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, has been found dead in his prison cell, a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor's office said.                                                                                                                                                                                               , Brunel was found alone, hanged with bedsheets, in his jail cell at the Santé prison in the French capital at around 1:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, the prosecutor's office told CNN. It would not comment on whether Brunel killed himself, adding an investigation into the cause of death has been opened, "as it is systematically done in these cases," entrusted to the French judicial police., Brunel's French lawyers told CNN their client's "decision was not guided by guilt, but by a sense of injustice."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "Jean-Luc Brunel has never stopped claiming his innocence. He has multiplied his efforts to prove it. A judge had released him a few months ago, and then he was re-incarcerated in undignified conditions," a statement sent to CNN by his lawyers Mathias Chichportich, Marianne Abgrall and Christophe Ingrain read.                                                                                , Accused of rape by several former top models, which he denied, the 75-year-old was put under formal investigation in France in late June 2021 for "rape of a minor over 15," the prosecutor's office confirmed.                                                                                                                                                                                        , Brunel was arrested at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in December 2020 on counts of "rape and sexual assault, rape and sexual assault on a minor under 15, rape and sexual assault on a minor over 15, sexual harassment, criminal associations and human trafficking to the detriment of minor victims for the purposes of sexual exploitation."                                                     , He was released under judicial supervision for a few days in November 2021, before being returned to prison by decision of the Paris Court of Appeals. He appealed the decision as the prosecution prepared its case.                                                                                                                                                                                  , Brunel's arrest was part of a probe launched in 2019 by French prosecutors, targeting "acts of sexual nature likely to have been committed by Jeffrey Epstein and possible accomplices," based on checks and cross-checks carried out on information provided to the Paris public prosecutor's office and exchanges with US authorities.                                                               , Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in the United States on August 10, 2019. He was awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, after pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing him of operating a sex trafficking ring from 2002 to 2005 at his Manhattan mansion and his Palm Beach estate, and allegedly paying girls as young as 14 for sex.                   , A medical examiner ruled his death was suicide by hanging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , </td>

A child died and dozens of others were injured in accidents involving its treadmills, forcing a recall of its products. It spent money as though its enormous pandemic-fueled growth would carry on forever — and fell hard when demand faltered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Now the company is staring down slowing sales, about $1.5 billion  of inventory and a spending hangover that left it with a $439 million loss last quarter. Its share price, which quadrupled in 2020, has plummeted nearly 80 percent over the last 12 months, at times dipping below its I.P.O. price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Barry McCarthy, the 68-year-old former chief financial officer of Spotify and Netflix, took over as chief executive this month after Peloton’s charismatic founder, John Foley, announced his resignation as C.E.O. An early employee at Netflix, Mr. McCarthy worked closely with one of its founders, Reed Hastings, to develop the subscription service’s revolutionary streaming business and to take the company public in 2002. When he became Spotify’s chief financial officer in 2015, he pioneered the audio company’s advertising strategy, including its push into podcasts.                                                                                                                                                           , At Peloton, Mr. McCarthy’s immediate task is to right the ship — the company’s chief financial officer said it wanted to save at least $800 million annually, on the same day Peloton announced it would lay off 20 percent of its corporate work force. But he also needs to fend off constant sale speculation, curtail frequent leaks and determine a postpandemic strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , And he’ll have to do so while navigating a complex relationship with Mr. Foley, who, as executive chairman, is not going far. Mr. Foley and other insiders still control a majority of Peloton’s shares, giving them veto power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In his first extensive interview since taking the job, Mr. McCarthy spoke to DealBook at Peloton’s offices in New York City. Sandy-haired and fit, he bears some accessories befitting a chief executive of a once hot fitness company: a Garmin watch, a Ministry of Supply shirt. But in his first C.E.O. job, Mr. McCarthy also brings a notable C.F.O. sensibility, speaking both deliberately and directly on his plans for Peloton, his relationship with Mr. Foley and what mistakes the business has made so far. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.                                                                                                                                                                 , How did you get the job?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , It was a shotgun marriage. I was retired and just managing private investments and playing a lot of golf. But I’ve been wanting to get back in the game. I saw the stories, the shutdown in production and the tanking of the business and all that stuff. And so I started to do a little reading. I was a passionate Peloton user, but I really didn’t know much about the business. I reached out to TCV [one of Peloton’s earliest investors] and said: ‘Hey, Coach, put me in. I can fix this.’ [Mr. Foley has said that he and the Peloton board ran a succession search over several months, and that the process moved fast once they “got in contact” with McCarthy.]                                                                     , Why did you think you could fix it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , I know subscriptions. I know consumer-facing businesses. I know growth. I know founders. I certainly know business models. And I know from my experience that product market fit is the hardest thing on the planet to find. And once you find it, it’s almost impossible to screw it up no matter how hard you try. And arguably, we’ve tried pretty hard here, but the customer love is just off the charts. The monthly churn is less than 1 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , What did you see in the story?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The two narratives on the company: One is “Implosion peaks during Covid: downward spiral, incompetent management team, company should get sold.” Another narrative is “No, actually Covid was the marketing campaign the company could never have afforded.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Peloton has built this large recurring revenue base with subscribers that is growing at 20-plus percent a year. The cost structure got out of whack with revenues, and they spent money on things that they shouldn’t have. But if you resize the cost structure, and you begin to reinvest in growth with product-line extensions and new markets and some other things, then there’s a lot to work with here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Lots of analysts have said that everyone who wants a Peloton already bought one.

I think the answer to that is clearly no.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , You’re going to see us play for scale, for sure. And that should mean that we change the pricing model in order to take advantage of elasticity, which I think should significantly accelerate the growth in subs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , How are you planning to change the pricing model to strike the right balance between revenue from subscriptions and products?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Selling subscriptions with a really low entry price. Playing around with the relationship between the monthly recurring revenue and the upfront cost to find some sweet spot in the consumer value proposition that gets people to buy into the user experience and affords you a really good margin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , So instead of selling a bike outright at more than $2,000 and then selling a subscription, you’re thinking of selling the whole thing as a subscription, say $150 or $200 a month — like a high-end gym membership?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , It’s probably, instead of $39, it’s maybe $70 or $80. And then the upfront cost is dramatically lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , How much do you worry about fixing the corporate culture?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Well, they did the cost cutting before I arrived, in fairness to them. Do I worry about being charismatic enough to lead a culture — the kind of company that has been built around a very charismatic leader? No. There are two sides to that coin, and, given where the company is, I think I’ve been well received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , What have you learned from the other founders you’ve worked with?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , They see things the rest of us don’t see, which is why they get to be founders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , What went wrong here?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , They got caught up in the vision thing at the expense of getting real and dealing with the world as it is.

That’s a fundamental difference. And both of them were having success. And the business never, you know, ran off the rails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , I would not have come unless John agreed to remain engaged on the product side. Nobody is hiring me to be their product guru. They started out in the equivalent of a one-room garage, and they got crowdsource funding, for goodness’ sake. And now they’re the dominant player in connected fitness. That didn’t happen by accident. Somebody actually did that. And I want to suck every ounce of that talent out of him that I can for as long as I can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , How hard will it be leading the company when John and other insiders still have a controlling stake and veto right? You still work for him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The question is: What best serves his economic interest? At the end of the day, he’s very much an economic animal. And so, if we’re winning in the marketplace with my leadership, I think this is a nonissue. He’s a happy camper. He’s doing what he likes doing. Which is not everything else that I’m doing — and he gets to be the product visionary, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , And if the company isn’t doing well, I’m getting replaced anyway. So it’s pretty cut and dry. And if I don’t do well — and there’s a change — maybe at that point the business gets sold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , What would you do if someone gave you a deal offer you couldn’t refuse?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , My guess is we were most at risk before I came. It was your best shot at acquiring at a bargain-basement price. If we’re able to re-accelerate the growth and articulate a vision that investors find compelling, then it would be a much bigger price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Do you think you’re going to have to raise more capital?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The answer is maybe. But we need a little more context to have insight into that answer. Regardless of what the strategy is, you need a capital structure to support it. So now if it becomes this enormously capital-intensive business, because you’re giving away a $2,000 bike and then recouping it over time, you can absolutely raise capital around it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , It would be some combination of debt, equity — mostly debt like we used at Netflix, because the bigger the subscriber base gets, the more predictable the revenue stream gets. And the more predictable the revenue stream gets, the more leverage you can put on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Are you going to hire anyone to help with the supply chain?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Definitely. For the next couple of weeks, we’re going to get a bloody nose because of the move to third-party distribution. We had 10,000 people scheduled to receive bikes from Peloton, and we moved them over to third parties. Ten thousand people are getting rescheduled. Plus, some of those 10,000 are going to get rescheduled again. So we need to up our comms game. And then, make sure that we’ve got people with the appropriate level of experience and expertise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Would you consider joint ventures?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Yeah, I would. Which ones? I don’t know. Should we do something with Amazon? Should we do something with YouTube? Is it Nike? Should we do a co-branded thing with Adidas and with retail? There’s a big opportunity in apparel — we do $250 million revenue in apparel. John’s wife is no longer running apparel for us, by the way: not an employee of the company anymore, which is something he fixed before I joined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , How often do you and John talk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Well, I haven’t been keeping track.

And John is ex officio reporting to me. John and I don’t always agree. Like he announces to the team at our all hands — which didn’t get cut short by the way — that we’re a family. And I say you’ll never hear me say we’re a family. We’re a sports team, and we’re trying to win the Super Bowl. And so we’re going to put the best players on the field we can. And if you go down the field, and we throw you the ball, and you drop it a bunch, we’re going to cut you.

Prices are rising at their fastest pace in four decades, and there are signs that inflation is creeping into a broader range of products and services. In surveys, Americans report feeling gloomier about the economy now than at the height of the lockdowns and job losses in the first weeks of the crisis.                                                                                  , In other words, it may no longer be that “the virus is the boss” — as Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist, has put it. But the changes that it set in motion have proved both more persistent and more pervasive than economists once expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “I — totally naïvely — thought that once a vaccine was available, that we were six months away from a complete re-evaluation of the economy, and instead we’re just grinding it out,” said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project, an economic policy arm of the Brookings Institution. “A switch didn’t get flipped, and I thought it was going to.”                                                                                                                                                                              , The resulting limbo is a challenge for the Biden administration, which has so far failed to convince a skeptical public that its economic policies are working, despite falling unemployment and a recovery that has surpassed the most optimistic projections by most measures. And it is a challenge for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, who have struggled to assess how long the pandemic’s disruptions will last or the best way to mitigate their effects.                                                                        , It is also a challenge for business owners like Katherine Raz.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Ms. Raz owns The Fernseed, a plant and flower shop with two locations in Tacoma, Wash. Like many retailers, the business has ridden the Covid-19 roller coaster: After closing for two and a half months at the beginning of the pandemic, Ms. Raz was able to reopen, and she even expanded the business in the summer of 2020. But a wave of cases later that year and a new round of government restrictions pushed the business to the brink and forced Ms. Raz to lay off one of her seven employees.                                   , In some ways, 2021 followed a similar pattern. Business boomed in the spring as falling case levels and rising vaccination rates fed optimism that the pandemic was nearing its end. Then the Delta and Omicron waves led to a drop-off in demand and created staffing challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , This time, though, Ms. Raz was ready. She had built up a financial buffer and had invested in product lines less likely to suffer when cases rose. She reduced employees’ hours when business slowed, but avoided layoffs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “I have a list of things, little levers that we can pull to make those adjustments to make the business more resilient,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , While Ms. Raz is no longer concerned about the survival of her business, she remains cautious. She would like to open a third location, in Seattle, and to start offering classes and holding events. She wants to hire a general manager to run day-to-day operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Those plans are on hold while Ms. Raz grapples with continuing disruptions. Supply chain problems have made it hard to get key products, like the terra cotta pots that she said were stuck somewhere in a shipping container. She has stocked up on inventory wherever possible, tying up capital for months longer than normal. And after two years of what she calls “emotional whiplash,” she is on constant guard for another setback.                                                                                                  , “I have stopped pinning my hopes on this being over, ever,” she said. “I’m just preparing for the worst all the time and not hoping for the best.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Some economists remain optimistic that the economy will normalize as the pandemic recedes, even if the process takes longer than initially expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Mr. Goolsbee, who was chief economic adviser under President Barack Obama, was among those who argued early in the pandemic that the best way to revive the economy was to get the pandemic itself under control. Until that happened, he said, the recovery would be steered by the ebb and flow of case counts and hospital capacity, variants and countermeasures.                                                                                                                                                                        , He recently pointed to the relatively mild economic impact of the Omicron wave as evidence that consumers were becoming more comfortable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “The reason the virus was the boss is that people were afraid; they changed their behavior,” he said. “If this is a sign that the fear is easing, the virus will no longer be the boss, and the economic pandemic will be ending.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , But others warn that the pandemic’s effects could outlive the pandemic itself, potentially resulting in a smaller work force and faster inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “It is appropriate to start asking, are some of these shifts going to stick to at least some degree?” said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. “Things that happen over a two-year period, the chances of them sticking are larger than things that happen over a one-year period.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Fear of the virus can still affect consumer demand. Spending at restaurants fell in December and January, as the most recent spike in coronavirus cases kept diners at home. Air travel, hotel bookings and other in-person services also suffered. And although employers added jobs in January, the total number of hours worked fell — partly because workers were home sick, and most likely also because of cutbacks in scheduling as demand declined.                                                                                  , But demand for services didn’t fall as far during the latest coronavirus wave as it did earlier in the pandemic, and preliminary data suggests that it has recovered more quickly. More comprehensive data through December shows that the crisis-induced shift in consumer spending away from goods and toward services is reversing, albeit slowly.                                                                                                                                                                                        , Supply disruptions have been harder to resolve. Shortages of computer chips, lumber and even garage doors have held up production of items from cars to houses, while a lack of shipping containers has led to delays in almost anything transported from overseas. Some bottlenecks have let up in recent months, but logistics experts expect it to take months if not years for supply chains to run smoothly again.                                                                                                                      , Then there is the labor shortage. The pandemic pushed millions of people out of the work force, and while many have returned, others — a disproportionate share of them women — have not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Diahann Thomas was at work at a Brooklyn call center in January when she got a call from her son’s school: Her 11-year-old had been exposed to a classmate who had tested positive for Covid-19, and she needed to pick him up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , The virus in the U.S. President Biden said that he would extend the national emergency first declared in March 2020 in response to the pandemic, which was set to expire on March 1. The decision comes as an Omicron wave recedes, though it now accounts for more deaths than Delta’s did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , In New York. The New York health commissioner announced that the state would not enforce a booster-shot requirement for health care workers set to take effect on Feb. 21. Too many workers were refusing to comply, leading to worries that the health care system would be disrupted with a mandate in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Around the world. Hong Kong said it would postpone the election of its next leader so that it could focus on containing a surge driven by Omicron. South Korea, where the variant shows no sign of peaking, reported 100,000 new daily coronavirus cases for the first time on Feb. 18, topping that threshold again the following day.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “There are all these moving parts now with Covid — one moment, they’re at school, the next moment they’re at home,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ms. Thomas, 50, said her employer declined to provide flexibility while her son was in quarantine. So she quit — a decision she said was made easier by the knowledge that employers are eager to hire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “It did boost my confidence to know that at the end of this, it’s not going to be difficult for me to pick up the pieces, and I have more bargaining power now,” she said. “There is this whole entire shift in terms of employee-employer relationship.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Ms. Thomas expects to return to work once school schedules become more reliable. But the pandemic has shown her the value of being at home with her three children, she said, and she wants a job where she can work from home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Whether and how people like Ms. Thomas return to work will be crucial to the economy’s path in coming months. If workers flood back to the job market as school and child care becomes more dependable and health risks recede, it will be easier for manufacturers and shipping companies to ramp up production and deliveries, giving supply a chance to catch up to demand. That in turn could allow inflation to cool without losing the economy’s progress over the past year.                                                          , “If you got the public health situation improved, you would see economic improvements in terms of increased work, increased output, increased functioning of the economy,” said Aaron Sojourner, a University of Minnesota economist who has studied the pandemic economy. “I do think that’s a real constraint.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , But people who retired early or left jobs to care for children may not go back to work right away, or may choose to work part time. And other changes may be similarly slow to reverse: Companies that were burned by shortages may maintain larger inventories or rely on shorter supply chains, driving up costs. Workers who enjoyed flexibility from employers during the pandemic may demand it in the future. Rates of entrepreneurship, automation and, of course, remote work all increased during the pandemic, perhaps permanently., Some of those changes could lead to higher inflation or slower growth. Others could make the economy more dynamic and productive. All make it harder for forecasters and policymakers to get a clear picture of the postpandemic economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “In almost every respect, economic ripple effects that we might have expected to be temporary or short-lived are proving to be more long-lasting,” said Luke Pardue, an economist for Gusto, a payroll platform for small businesses. “The new normal is looking a lot different.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> , BEIJING — If U.S. regulation forces Chinese companies to delist from New York, new rules from Beijing further complicates their path to raising money in public markets abroad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Since Tuesday, new rules from the Cyberspace Administration of China require Chinese internet platform companies with personal data of more than 1 million users to get approval before listing overseas.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , While the rules do not apply to companies that have already gone public, those pursuing dual or secondary listings overseas must follow the CAC's new approval process, according to a CNBC translation of a Chinese article published Thursday on the regulator's website.                                                                                                                                      , It's yet another consideration for international investors looking at Chinese companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , "The timetable for companies' overseas listings has become longer, and uncertainty has increased for listing," said Ming Liao, founding partner of Beijing-based Prospect Avenue Capital, according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese remarks.                                                                                                                                                                , As regulators and businesses figure out how the new measures will be implemented, institutional investors hope to better understand the government's thinking by seeing some approvals for overseas listings, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                           , Fallout from Chinese ride-hailing app Didi's U.S. IPO in late June prompted Beijing to increase regulatory scrutiny on what was a rush of Chinese companies looking to raise money in New York.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Chinese IPOs in the U.S. have essentially dried up in the months since, while existing U.S.-listed Chinese stocks face the threat of delisting in coming years from Washington's more stringent audit requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                              , Several of these Chinese companies, including Alibaba, have turned to Hong Kong for dual or secondary listings in the last few years. That way investors could swap their U.S. shares for ones in Hong Kong in the event of a delisting.                                                                                                                                                                         , Only about 80 of 250 U.S.-listed Chinese companies would be eligible for a secondary or dual primary listing in Hong Kong, according to China Renaissance analysis from Bruce Pang and his team in January. That's due to stringent requirements in Hong Kong for minimum market capitalization and other factors.                                                                                               , The remaining U.S.-listed Chinese companies would likely only have the choice of privatizing, and then attempting a listing in the mainland A share market, the report said. "In practice," the analysts said, "we think Hong Kong will not be exempted from the cybersecurity process – the door is still open, in our opinion, for Beijing to impose a cybersecurity review on proposed listings in Hong Kong.", The mainland market is less accessible to foreign investors and is dominated by more sentiment-driven retail investors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Analysts also point out the Hong Kong stock market doesn't compare with New York when it comes to trading volume and the price tech companies can get for their shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , It remains to be seen to what extent cybersecurity scrutiny will apply to future Chinese stock offerings in Hong Kong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Goldman says Chinese stocks are too big to ignore — and names some top picks with serious upside                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , These are the top stock picks in Asia to play rising interest rates, according to Bank of America                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , HSBC picks Chinese stocks to play a rising U.S. 10-year Treasury yield                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , U.S.-listed, China-based companies that pursue secondary or dual listings in Hong Kong only need the CAC's review if the regulator identifies a national security risk related to the companies' products or data processing, said Marcia Ellis, global chair of the private equity group at Morrison &amp; Forrester, Hong Kong.                                                                                    , That's "a different threshold" from the CAC review required for listings outside of China in markets such as London or Singapore, Ellis said.

According to South Korean police, he was a construction worker in his 30s who earned money by doing manual labor.                            ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The man's case is rare -- while more than 10,000 North Korean defectors have arrived in South Korea in the past decade, just 30 have returned home, where they face the prospect of being put into forced labor camps, according to official South Korean data.                                                                                               , But defectors and advocates say even if the man's rationale for leaving South Korea is unclear, the fact that some North Korean defectors are willing to return to one of the world's most politically isolated countries only highlights how challenging life can be in the South for North Koreans.                                                         , Why people defect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Since the Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953, North and South Korea have been separated by an almost impenetrable border preventing anyone from crossing to the other side.                                                                                                                                                                           , Over subsequent decades, South Korea has modernized, becoming one of the world's richest and most technologically developed countries. Meanwhile, North Korea has become increasingly isolated, with citizens subject to widespread poverty and limited basic freedoms.                                                                                       , So it isn't hard to see why people may want to escape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Since 1998, more than 33,000 people have defected from North Korea to South Korea, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. However, numbers have dwindled in recent years after Kim imposed even tougher border controls to prevent Covid inflows.                                                                                                   , On very rare occasions, defectors -- like the former gymnast -- manage to escape through the heavily guarded demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. The vast majority, like defector Kang Chun-hyuk, flee over North Korea's lengthy border with China.                                                                                         , Kang's family made the trip in 1998 when he was 12 years old, before finally making it to South Korea a few years later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , In North Korea, Kang remembers barely having enough food to survive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Sometimes, his family would make a single portion of dry noodles into a meal that would feed him and his parents for a week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , "It wasn't worth going to school, so me and my classmates stole food like corn or potatoes," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , According to a survey of 3,000 people released this year by the North Korean Refugees Foundation, food shortages are one of the most common motivations for defection, with nearly 22% saying that was why they had defected. The most common reason given -- at 23% -- was that people didn't like being controlled or monitored by the North Korean regime. , Once they arrive in South Korea, there are measures in place to support them. Defectors undergo a compulsory, 12-week education session to help them adjust to life in their new home. They're given financial support and accommodation, and access to health care and employment services.                                                                  , But even so, life for defectors is often a struggle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Finding work and fitting in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Before Kang Na-ra -- no relation to Kang Chun-hyuk -- defected in 2014 as a teenager, she thought her life in South Korea would mirror the K-dramas she watched in secret in the city of Chongjin.                                                                                                                                                            , But South Korea was a far cry from the romantic world she'd seen on screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Kang Na-ra's mother defected before her -- she does not want to say why -- but their life together in South Korea was not what she'd hoped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Her mother worked long hours and was often away from home dancing in a North Korean defectors performing group to make ends meet. Although Kang Na-ra spoke the same language, she was lonely and had few friends in South Korea.                                                                                                                             , Another defector, who asked not to be named or further identified for fear of repercussions for his family remaining in North Korea, said he also struggled with culture shock when he defected a few years ago -- even bright and colorful signs and the abundance of English words used in language in South Korea made him feel uncomfortable.             , "You don't see things like that in North Korea," said the defector. "I didn't like many things in South Korea at first."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , He also said many defectors found it difficult to get a job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Statistics for 2020 released last year by South Korea's Unification Ministry found defectors had a higher unemployment rate than the general population, with 9.4% of defectors unemployed, compared with 4% of the general population in December 2020.                                                                                                      , "Getting a good job is important, but even South Koreans who are raised and educated here find it difficult to get a decent job," he said. "You can imagine how hard it can be for North Korean defectors."                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Kang Chun-hyuk's family was given a flat by the government when they made it to South Korea in 2001 after three years in China. But his thick North Korean accent made it hard for him to fit in at school and he dropped out. He worked in manual labor until he was 25 years old, unsure if he would be able to ever do anything else.                      , For others, the struggle to adjust and find work can have deadly consequences. In 2019, North Korean defector Han Sang-ok was found dead in her apartment with her 6-year-old son after she failed to pay her bills for months.                                                                                                                               , A water meter inspector noticed a foul smell coming from the apartment and called the police, who found two heavily decomposed bodies and an empty fridge, leading the police officer to note starvation as the suspected cause of death.                                                                                                                     , Separation pains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , But not all defectors have dreams of a bright life in South Korea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Kim Ryon-hui is a rare case of a defector who arrived almost by accident.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The 54-year-old, who lived a relatively upscale life in North Korea, went to China in 2011 to visit relatives and seek medical care for liver disease. But when she arrived, she found Chinese doctors wanted payment upfront.                                                                                                                                ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Kim said a broker told her Chinese people often went to South Korea to earn money. So, she signed up for a journey to South Korea and left her North Korean passport with the broker group -- not realizing that meant she would never be able to return home.                                                                                                , Kim feels hostility from South Koreans, especially when North Korea's leader fires missiles. She told CNN she struggled to adapt to a capitalist society governed by market pressures and to understand what she sees as a dog-eat-dog world.                                                                                                                 , "It's like we're oil and South Korea is water, so we can't mix," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , That's a common sentiment for defectors. According to the North Korean Refugees Foundation survey, while most people are happy in South Korea because they can live a free life and earn relative to how much they work, many are unhappy with the level of intense competition.                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But the hardest part for Kim is the separation from her family. South Korean law prevents any communication with people in North Korea and South Koreans cannot travel there. Unless Kim sneaks back into North Korea, or the two Koreas reach a peace agreement, she has little chance of seeing her family again.                                           , Kim last saw her daughter when she was 17 -- now her daughter is 28. Kim is only able to communicate with her family through journalists who take letters and gifts for her to North Korea, but that hasn't been possible since North Korea closed its borders due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.                                                          , "It's scary to be alone," she said. "When I see lights on in other apartments in the evening, I imagine families having dinner together. That's the saddest and loneliest feeling."                                                                                                                                                                           , Why defectors return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Despite the difficulties of being in South Korea, the vast majority stay put. For most, that's because the benefits of staying in South Korea are far greater than the risks they face if they return.                                                                                                                                                        , Seo Jae-pyeong, the director of the Association of the North Korean Defectors, defected in 2001. In the 20 years he's lived in South Korea, he's only known one defector personally who returned to North Korea.                                                                                                                                              , She was a doctor with a family back in North Korea who didn't realize her brother was bringing her to South Korea, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , "She didn't have a reason to defect and she couldn't get used to life in South Korea," Seo said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , He questioned how many of the 30 defectors who returned to North Korea had left of their own free will. He said some may have been blackmailed or kidnapped near the border between China and North Korea.                                                                                                                                                    , Others might have had major financial difficulties that left them with few other choices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Lee Na-kyung, a defector activist for single parents and people with disabilities from the North, said by the time many defectors arrive in South Korea they already have major debts to brokers who helped them cross the border.                                                                                                                            , Some defectors pay their government settlement money to the brokers, and then sink further into debt as they struggle to find work, according to Lee, who defected from North Korea in 2005 after her husband was framed for a crime she says he didn't commit.                                                                                               , For some, the hardship of life in South Korea doesn't meet their expectations. She knows of one man who was a high-ranking military officer in North Korea who could only find work in a junkyard in South Korea. "He said that he would rather die at home instead of dying as a junkman," she said.                                                         , What next?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , A month after the gymnast Kim crossed back into North Korea, it's unclear whether he is still alive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Although the South Korean military spotted him on surveillance footage crossing the barbed wires into the demilitarized zone, they failed to stop him, the South Korean military's Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Won In-choul said in a briefing in January.                                                                                                 , He was seen four times on security camera on the south side of the border, and once after he crossed the Military Demarcation Line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , At one point, soldiers mistook him for a defector coming from the North. At another point, they went to find him. Later, they found no trace of him except a feather caught on a wire that they suspected had come from his puffer jacket.                                                                                                                    , There were "no unusual movements" of the North Korean military over the incident, South Korea's Defense Ministry spokesman Boo Seung-chan said last month at another briefing.                                                                                                                                                                                , And while North Korean state media has crowed about past defectors returning home, there has been no mention of last month's defector in state news publications.                                                                                                                                                                                             , For those in South Korea, it's a reminder that the country's policies to help defectors could still be improved. Last week, the South Korean government announced it was launching a new team to improve the safety of defectors, noting that despite its current efforts, some defectors were still "experiencing difficulties settling into our society."   , But defector advocates were dubious about how effective those new steps would be, pointing out that support measures are in place -- they just don't work.                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Even defectors who appear to have successfully made their transition sometimes struggle with the pull back to North Korea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Two years after she defected, Kang Na-ra told her mother she wanted to go back. But she didn't want to risk her life after going through so much to get to South Korea.                                                                                                                                                                                       , Now Kang, 25, is a television personality and YouTuber with more than 300,000 subscribers who watch her clips about life in North Korea. Her income is unstable, but at least she's enjoying life.                                                                                                                                                            , "Still today, I wonder if I made the right decision," she said.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Jamaica Hikes Interest Rates by 150Bps </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The central bank of Jamaica raised its benchmark interest rate by 150bps to 4% on February 18th of 2022, as well as stronger measures to contain liquidity expansion and ensure foreign exchange stability. Interest rates weren’t this high since June of 2017, as policymakers said that inflation continued to accelerate and stood well above target, while the prospects of faster tightening plans by major foreign central banks could precipitate capital outflows and pressure the Jamaican dollar. The bank also noted that underlying demand pressures may also begin to threaten the stability of foreign exchange rates and, with it, risking efforts to bring down inflation. Looking forward, the committee agreed to maintain or tighten monetary policy further in future meetings to ensure the medium-term inflation target, namely the annual inflation rate target range of 4 to 6%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The dollar index firmed to 96.1 on Friday, ending the week unchanged, as traders monitored a series of headlines about the Russia-Ukraine standoff and prospects of a more aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Fed. US secretary of state Antony Blinken agreed to meet with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov next week, while on the other hand, Russian media said a car exploded near a government building in separatist-controlled Donetsk, and civilians were ordered to evacuate the breakaway region, heightening fears that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine. Meanwhile, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard repeated his call for Fed's strong action and Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said she supports hiking rates faster if needed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US gasoline futures ended the week trading at $2.68 a gallon, slightly down from an over seven-year high of $2.79 reached earlier in the week, as worries over Iranian oil returning to markets offset upside risks from geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe. Iran was reportedly close to a deal on its nuclear programme, which could mean the release of about 1.3 million barrels a day of crude supply and ease a tight global market. Meanwhile, Russian backed separatists started evacuating civilians from Donetsk amid heavy shelling with government forces, raising fears of an imminent war in the region, which could disrupt supplies from major oil producer Russia. On a weekly basis, gasoline ended 2.2% lower, snapping eight consecutive weeks of gains. </td>

Putin of Russia may order an attack on Ukraine, executives at the multinational companies, for the most part, don’t believe that Russian troops will actually follow through with a ground invasion, said Anna Derevyanko, the deputy director of the European Business Association.                                                                                                             , “Companies have put in place contingency plans, but they do not believe something terrible is going to happen,” said Ms. Derevyanko, whose association includes Nestlé, BASF, ArcelorMittal, Bayer and over 1,000 European firms that employ more than two million people in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                  , “If you ask business people, they believe that a physical invasion is a low-risk scenario,” she added. “There is no sense of panic.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The prospect of cyberattacks, on the other hand, is more worrisome. Government websites, state-owned banks and parts of the nation’s infrastructure have battled online invasions by hackers, believed by Ukrainians to be Russians, looking to disable computers and steal data. European and American companies in Ukraine see digital attacks as one of the major threats they must deal with and have moved to strengthen their cybersecurity, Ms. Derevyanko said., The IT Ukraine Association, which includes local and international tech companies, such as Sigma Software and the video game giant Ubisoft, said that the industry’s presence in the country had grown steadily since Russia’s devastating invasion of Crimea in 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Companies in the tech industry, now worth $6.8 billion, have plans to ensure the security and safety of their employees in the event of “emergencies” as part of their business strategy, the association said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , “The Armed Forces of Ukraine have accumulated strength, gained combat experience and is ready to defend the country and its population,” the statement continued. In turn, it said, tech companies’ response plans  “are aimed at protecting talent and their business processes continuity.”                                                                                                                                                                          , More than 90 percent of the tech companies surveyed this month assessed the risk of an escalation of the conflict as low to medium, the association added, noting that none had prepared for a full relocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine said that its 633 members, which include 3M, Toyota and Citibank, continued to do business but had contingency plans to continue working in the event of an emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Most of the member companies made their plans long ago but continue to update and review them, said Andy Hunder, president of the business association.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ms. Derevyanko, of the European Business Association, said that Ukraine was counting on continued foreign investment to help keep the economy stable. Multinationals are located around the country in agribusiness, pharmaceuticals, technology and logistics.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Ukraine’s economy had only started to recover in recent years from a debilitating blow after Moscow in 2014 annexed Crimea, and pro-Russian rebels seized swathes of the eastern Donbas region in Ukraine. Since then, Western allies have seeded Ukraine and businesses operating there with over $48 billion in bilateral and multilateral economic support.                                                                                                         , This week, the United States pledged to strengthen Ukraine’s economy, after a statement by the Group of 7 industrial nations promising to do the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , “For now, companies are saying they plan to continue business as usual,” said Ms. Derevyanko. But the situation could yet grow complicated, especially if major seaports and airports are blocked, thwarting exports and dealing a further blow to the economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Natural Gas Futures Drop ahead of Weekend </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US natural gas futures swung between gains and losses to close 1% lower at $4.4 per million British thermal units on Friday, with the volatility being mainly driven by slight changes in weather forecasts for early March. The two-week weather outlook points to colder-than-usual temperatures but reports painted a mixed picture for the first days of March, with some forecasts seeing slightly milder weather. Also, investors continued to reassess the latest EIA inventory data, which came 3 billion cubic feet short (bcf) of market expectations at 190 bcf. The shortfall between current storage levels and the five-year average widened to 11.6%. On a weekly basis, the contract jumped 12.7%, rebounding from a 13.8% fall last week. </td>

Grynbaum, John Koblin and Emily Steel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , On a Saturday in March 2020, as Covid-19 was invading the United States, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo went on CNN for a live interview. Among other topics, he was asked about a possible government-enforced quarantine of New York that had been floated by President Donald J. Trump.                                                                                                              , It was a newsworthy topic, but its path onto viewers’ screens would turn out to be controversial — and highly consequential for the future of one of the world’s most powerful news networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Before the interview, Governor Cuomo had told a senior CNN executive, Allison Gollust, about subjects that he’d like to be asked about on air, according to several people familiar with the matter. Ms. Gollust, CNN’s longtime chief of communications and marketing and a former top aide of the governor, passed along the topics to CNN producers and then reported back to the governor., “Done,” she wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , On Tuesday, Ms. Gollust was forced to resign from CNN after an internal investigation found a trove of written communications between her and Governor Cuomo, including messages about the March 2020 appearance, the people said. Jeff Zucker, who at the time was CNN’s president, was aware of many of the communications between Ms. Gollust and the governor, the people said.           , The episode is the latest example of how closely entwined CNN’s leadership was with one of the country’s most prominent Democratic politicians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Producers and bookers for television news shows routinely talk with guests before their scheduled appearances and discuss questions and topics that are likely to come up on air. It is unusual, though, for a senior executive to be involved in that pre-interview process — especially when that executive previously worked for the person who’s being interviewed.                       , Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Ms. Gollust, said the communications with the governor were appropriate. Ms. Gollust “in no way suggested that inclusion of these topics was a condition of the interview, nor did she suggest the interview should be limited to these subjects,” Ms. Heller said.                                                                                            , She added: “WarnerMedia relying on this everyday practice as justification for dismissing Allison demonstrates how ignorant they are of journalistic practices, and further proves that her dismissal is nothing more than retaliation.”                                                                                                                                                      , CNN, whose slogan is “the most trusted name in news,” is facing mounting questions about how its senior executives and its top-rated anchor — Chris Cuomo, the governor’s younger brother — steered coverage of Governor Cuomo, who resigned last summer.                                                                                                                                     , In a memo to employees this week, Jason Kilar, the chief executive of WarnerMedia, which is CNN’s parent company, wrote that Ms. Gollust was resigning after the internal investigation found unspecified “violations of company policies, including CNN’s news standards and practices,” by her, Mr. Zucker and Chris Cuomo.                                                                 , Her resignation was the latest blow to CNN, which was already reeling in the wake of Mr. Zucker’s abrupt ouster two weeks earlier. Mr. Zucker said he was leaving because he had failed to disclose a romantic relationship with Ms. Gollust.                                                                                                                                                 , The internal review, conducted by the law firm of Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore, began last fall with an examination of allegations of workplace misconduct against Chris Cuomo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Mr. Zucker fired Mr. Cuomo in December, days after the network received a letter claiming that Mr. Cuomo had years earlier sexually assaulted a woman and that he later offered to air a flattering CNN segment about her employer. The woman perceived that as an effort to buy her silence. Mr. Cuomo has denied the allegations.                                                           , Mr. Cuomo also came under fire for having closely advised his brother on how to fend off a sexual misconduct scandal that ultimately forced the governor to resign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , After Mr. Cuomo’s departure from CNN, the Cravath review took on a life of its own, and it quickly upended the news network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Investigators learned that Mr. Zucker and Ms. Gollust, who had worked closely together on and off for more than two decades, were having a romantic affair that had not been disclosed to human resources or other executives at WarnerMedia.                                                                                                                                                 , The Cravath investigators also uncovered extensive written communications between Governor Cuomo and Ms. Gollust, who had briefly worked for the governor in late 2012 and early 2013, the people said.                                                                                                                                                                                       , It wasn’t clear what all of those communications were about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , But investigators found messages during the pandemic in which Governor Cuomo informed Ms. Gollust about three specific subjects that he wanted to be covered during a March 28,

with Russia.                                                                                                                                                                           , The internal

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canada’s main stock index, the S&amp;P/TSX, closed 0.8% lower at a three-week low of 21,008 on Friday, the third straight decline, amid a broad risk aversion due to escalating tensions in Ukraine. All sectors ended lower save for consumer cyclicals, with healthcare and energy leading losses. Reports that citizens in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic were evacuating the region raised alarms about an imminent Russian invasion. Meanwhile, preliminary data for January pointed to a 2.4% rebound in retail trade, from a 1.8% decline in December. Also, Ottawa’s police arrested 21 protesters, including three organizers of the “Freedom Convoy” movement in the city center and began towing trucks out of the streets to put an end to a three-week blockade in front of the Prime Ministers’ office and the Parliament. On the earnings front, Air Canada reported a smaller quarterly loss on recovering holiday travel. On a weekly basis, the index shed 2.4%, snapping three consecutive weeks of gains. </td>

We're seeing about the same number of rollbacks now that we had at the end of Q1 last year," Furner said, noting prices for consumer electronics and dry groceries were areas in select stores seeing rollbacks. , GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Walmart and Sam's Club operate 5,342 stores in the U.S.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Shares of Walmart are down 4.6% year-to-date as of Friday, less than the S&amp;P 500's 8.8% decline.  </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The main Sao Paulo stock index, Bovespa, erased early gains to close 0.6% lower at a 112,861 during a volatile session on Friday, as investors were spooked by reports of spiking tensions in eastern Ukraine. Early in the session, the benchmark index was trading above the 114,000 level, with hopes of a diplomatic solution to tensions in Ukraine, but the movement lost strength when authorities in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk began evacuating civilians. The top loser of the session was logistics firm Rumo Logística (-8.8%), which saw Q4 net results switch to a BRL 384M loss from a BRL 3M profit a year earlier. In contrast, Cielo jumped 12% after the announcement that the company will sell a stake in Merchant e-Solutions for 1.5 billion reais. Quarterly net profits for utility Neoenergia fell 36% but jumped 15.9% for wind energy firm Aeris. On a weekly basis, the index ended flat, pausing five straight weeks of gains. </td>

It costs more than nearly anything else you’ll ever buy. The price may have risen over $50,000 last year. And now, here you are, trying to figure out what the machinations of the Federal Reserve might mean for you and your home purchase.                                                                                                                                               , That’s hard, and I’m sorry. If it’s any consolation, professional prognosticators don’t know what’s going to happen next, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “We know every forecast will be wrong,” said Douglas G. Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist for Fannie Mae.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , One thing seems certain: The Fed is planning to raise the rates that banks charge one another for short-term loans. That will increase borrowing costs for all kinds of loans — although mortgages aren’t as directly connected to those increases as others.                                                                                                                                                                               , The Fed’s goal is to tamp down overall inflation, but the weird circumstances caused by the pandemic mean the housing market might not obey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , That means you’ll have to be flexible. So start with the knowable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , There were double-digit percentage price increases last year on what is now, at the median, a $408,000 collection of new gypsum and sticks. (It’s $350,000 for existing homes.) Mortgage rates have already risen more than a percentage point off their record lows. And sales have jumped to start the year as many buyers tried to lock in a more attractive rate than what might be available in just a few months.                     , Now take some deep breaths. You have questions about what this means. These answers should help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The Fed sure seems like it’s going to raise rates next month. What’s going to happen to mortgages?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Mortgage interest rates will probably rise before the year is over, from their current level of 3.92 percent. But it’s not just Fed rate increases in play here. There is an unusual action that may come from the central bank that could drive an increase.                                                                                                                                                                               ,  The federal government owns enormous bundles of home mortgages that live inside bonds, which it bought in recent years to stabilize the housing market and the overall economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , The housing market is more than fine now, and the Federal Reserve wants out of those bonds sooner rather than later. If it sells too many too fast, however, it could flood the market and force bond prices down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , At that point, bankers trying to package and sell new bundles of mortgages would need those new bonds to pay more to investors so they’ll buy them. And in order for those bonds to pay more, homeowners will need to be paying higher interest rates on their mortgages.                                                                                                                                                                   , That is one likely scenario where mortgage rates would rise further this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , OK, so mortgage rates may rise some more. Won’t prices fall at that point? (Please?)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Well, prices stopped growing as quickly as they had been when rates rose for a bit in 2018. Does that help? That could happen this time, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , But … it might not. When you ask people about what they plan to pay if mortgage rates rise, as Andreas Fuster and Basit Zafar did for a paper they published early last year, the responses seemed surprising. The researchers asked what the prospective buyers would be willing to pay if mortgage rates were 6.5 percent instead of 4.5 percent.                                                                                         , The respondents’ price target was only 5 percent lower, on average. Nearly half didn’t change their figure at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , That’s a sign there could still be a lot of competition among buyers, even with higher mortgage rates. Then again, that survey took place before consumers were so antsy about inflation driving up the costs of day-to-day living.                                                                                                                                                                                                         , So you’re saying this time is different?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Yes — and no. The facts always change, even if economic, stock and housing market cycles are regular (if not predictable or consistently timed) events over our lifetime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , And, oh, what a set of facts we have. A pandemic and the government response resulted in many people spending less on travel, commuting, clothes, student loan payments and entertainment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , That put extra money in the down payment accounts of those who didn’t lose their jobs or any income. At the same time, the mortgage bundles the Fed was buying helped lead to record-low mortgage rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , That made it easier to bid up house prices — just as lots of people sped up moving plans in search of more space to work at home and keep kids out of their hair. There was even more competition for available homes, and new homes took longer to build because of supply chain issues and labor shortages.                                                                                                                               , There’s more. Professional investors were buying homes — with the all-cash bids that most sellers prefer and most individual owners can’t match — as never before in 2021. According to Redfin, they accounted for 18.4 percent of the home purchases in the fourth quarter of 2021. In Southern and Western cities — like Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami, Orlando, Las Vegas and Phoenix — investors accounted for more than a quarter of sales., These institutional buyers are probably not done, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , “It’s an absolutely terrible time to be a buyer,” said Sarah Ponder, a financial planner in Austin, Texas. There, the median home price has risen 30 percent in the past year, according to the city’s Board of Realtors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Ms. Ponder, who specializes in helping real estate professionals and has already done five property transactions of her own in just 15 years of adulthood, pointed to one final X-factor: Folks her age may not know what rapidly rising interest rates do to one’s home-buying psyche.                                                                                                                                                     , “I’m part of an entire generation of people that are accustomed to low rates,” she said. “If and when it normalizes to longer-term averages, then people my age will be relatively unhappy.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Is there any reason for me to rush to figure all of this out?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , No, even if there has been a spike in purchases lately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ms. Ponder isn’t necessarily advising people to sit this market out, though she would prefer that people not stretch themselves financially. Financial planners — and lenders — generally want people to spend no more than 35 percent or so of their income on total housing costs. Most people should resist the temptation to push those boundaries; Ms. Ponder generally wants her clients well below them.                             , And remember: Mortgage math in a higher-interest-rate environment may not be truly horrible as long as a bank will still give you a loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $300,000 has a $1,432 monthly payment if the interest rate is 4 percent, near its current levels. At 6 percent — which, to be clear, would be the highest rate in more than 13 years — the payment would be $1,799. An extra $367 a month is hardly pocket change, but it’s a sum that many people may still be able to squeeze out of a budget.                                                           , Still nervous? It’s worth remembering that playing along is not a requirement. Being a renter is not a disqualifier for life satisfaction. And in some circumstances, buying a home in an environment like this is a recipe for regret.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “The most important thing is to make sure that you’re willing to stay at least five years,” said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist. “Whatever happens in the market, you should gain enough equity where when you sell, you’ll come out ahead, even after paying fees.”                                                                                                                                                           , So maybe this isn’t a beware moment just yet. But it’s certainly a bewary one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “What I worry about is people starting to act irrational when trying to compete for a home that they don’t actually like,” Dr. Fairweather said. “The worst case is that you buy it and end up selling it in a year. If the market’s down, you could be in a really precarious position.”                                                                                                                                                   , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Oil futures declined on Friday, widening their weekly loss to more than 2%.

In the morning the markets calmed down a bit after the US said it agreed to meet Russia next week for talks while in the afternoon news came that Moscow-backed separatists in Donbas have ordered the evacuation of civilians to Russia heightening fears that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine. At the same time, investors remained concerned about the next Fed steps after St. Louis Fed President Bullard repeated his call for Fed's strong action and Cleveland Fed President Mester said she supports hiking rates faster if needed. </td>

Russian media said a car exploded near a government building in Donetsk which is controlled by Moscow back separatists, and civilians were ordered to evacuate heightening fears that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine. Meanwhile, St. Louis Fed Bullard warned that inflation could get out of control without rate hikes and Fed Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said she supports hiking rates faster if needed. On corporate updates, BoA analysts reiterated their “underperform” rating on Intel’s stock, while Roku shares plunged 24% after quarterly revenues missed expectations and issued weak guidance. On a weekly basis, all three indexes are set for a 2% drop, the second in a row. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Gold futures fell on Friday to settle below the $1,900 mark, but still gained just over 3% for the week. While "war fears dominate the headlines, I believe the main driving force behind this rally remains rising inflation," said Peter Spina, president and chief executive officer at GoldSeek.com, adding that there may be a $20 "war premium" already built into gold prices. Gold may "swing and pullback" from the $1,900 mark, but "as we have seen for the last weeks, pullbacks get bought and the price reverses higher," said Spina. "The trend is up, and the gold price can quickly continue climbing here to its next technical price target of $1,920." April gold

Everybody wants sanctions on Russia, and then Russia turned off the natural gas to Europe. And, you know, all that kind of stuff, you know, would drive up energy prices and give us a big negative economic shock.                                                                                                                                                                   , RUSSIA-UKRAINE: KYIV DOWNPLAYS CONCERNS OF AN INVASION AS SHELLING RAMPS UP: LIVE UPDATES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , I think it's clear that that's not going to happen. And that's really, you know, a big risk for the Ukrainians because, you know, the Western leaders have said, no, we're not going to let Russia attacking Ukraine upset our economy. And so I don't think that the big market moves that we've seen as Ukraine has gotten closer and closer to conflict. I don't think that those are a signal that there's going to be a big negative economic shock. In fact, we used to talk about this decoupling thing where, you know, foreign policy is decoupled from the economy, and I think that'll be evident in this one as well. , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Hoover Institute distinguished visiting fellow Kevin Hassett discusses the economic impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the U.S. combatting inflation. </td>

They then will have to hold those positions for at least a year and will be banned from any trading during "periods of heightened financial market stress." There is no set definition of the term, which will be determined by the Fed chair and the board's general counsel., Along with stocks, bonds and crypto, the ban extends to commodities, foreign currencies, sector index funds, derivatives, short positions and agency securities or using margin debt to buy assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Congress has been debating a measure that also will restrict its members from owning individual stocks, though it has not been adopted yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Got a confidential news tip?

       CEO David Solomon on Thursday said 2022 will mark a shift from low interest rates and tame inflation to tighter borrowing conditions and above-trend inflation. In his remarks at the Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum, Solomon updated financial targets the firm had laid out at its investor day in 2020. The bank now expects to book $350 billion in inflows in its asset management and wealth management by 2024, up from its earlier target of $250 billion. The firm is projecting 14% to 16% return on equity, up from its earlier target of greater than 13%. It's projecting $225 billion in gross alternatives fundraising by 2024 and greater than $10 billion in firmwide management fees.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 reversed course during the session to close 0.3% lower at a two-week low of 7,515 on Friday, in line with its European peers, as fears of imminent war returned after reports that citizens in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic were evacuating the region. Also, Russian media said a car exploded near a government building in Donetsk. At the same time, storm Eunice triggered red warnings in England, with record gusts of wind in parts of the country that have ripped the roof of the O2 arena and left tens of thousands of homes without power. Losses were limited by upbeat retail sales in January and strong earnings from warehousing specialist Segro. Among the worst performers, NatWest Group shed 2.4% after the bank beat estimates but lowered its annual cost-cutting target for the next two years. On the week, the FTSE 100 lost 2%, its worst week since late November. </td>

Meanwhile, concerns mounted over the possibility of war in Europe, after a separatist leader in eastern Ukraine announced the evacuation of civilians to Russia amid soaring tensions. On the domestic front, President Cyril Rampahosa has come under criticism for appointing yet another advisor and task team to do what some said should be done by his ministers. On the earnings front, South African retailer Massmart, the owner of Makro, Game and Builders, has flagged a more than 2 billion rand loss for its 2021 year, hit by the effects of July’s civil unrest as well as the timing of insurance payouts. For the week, the JSE was almost flat. </td>

On the corporate front, Hermes dropped 4.6% from reporting slower sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2021, mostly due to capacity constraints on its leather goods and saddlery divisions. At the same time, EDF fell 2.3% after announcing a rights issue that will raise EUR 2.5 billion to improve its financial structure, as the group struggles with low availability of its nuclear plant fleets due to corrosion and safety issues. At the same time, Renault (unchanged) posted an operating margin of 3.6% for 2021, already exceeding its target set for 2023. Consequently, the group increased its margin target to 4% for 2022, despite the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors. </td>

On the corporate front, Buzzi Unicem (-2%) led the losses due to its large exposure to the Ukrainian economy. At the same time, tech and manufacturing stocks both traded in the red, driven by STMicroelectronics (-2.3%) and Nexi (-2.6%). On the other hand, Eni gained 1% after posting an adjusted net profit of EUR 4.74 billion in 2021 compared to the EUR 0.758 billion loss in 2020, marking its strongest year since 2012, largely due to the rise in oil and gas prices during 2021.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield of the 10-year OFZ treasury bond rebounded to 9.8% in mid-February as fears of war in Ukraine and economic consequences of sanctions continued to pressure Russian assets. Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces blamed each other for violating ceasefire agreements in the Luhansk People’s Republic, an event labeled by the US and NATO as Moscow looking for a pretext for war amid the imminent threat of an invasion. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Russia raised its interest rate to 9.5% on its February meeting while paving the way for future hikes this year. Tighter policy came after significant inflationary pressure led policymakers to upwardly revise inflation expectations to 5-6% by the end of 2022 and only returning to the bank’s target of 4% by mid 2023, erasing previous expectations that interest rates would ease in this year. </td>

Investors also keep an eye on corporate results from Neoenergia, Aeris, Rumo Logística and Cosan. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Shares of General Electric Co. 
        GE,
        -5.86%
       took a dive in morning trading Friday, swinging from a slight gain to a 4.3% loss, after the industrial conglomerate disclosed that supply chain challenges will put pressure on growth, profit and free cash flow through the first half of 2022, more so than typical seasonality. "In light of recent commentary from other companies, a number of investors and analysts have been asking us for additional color about what we are seeing so far in the first quarter," the company said in investor newsletter. "While we are seeing progress on our strategic priorities, we continue to see supply chain pressure across most of our businesses as material and labor availability and inflation are affecting Healthcare, Renewable Energy and Aviation. Although varied by business, we expect these challenges to persist at least through the first half of the year." The company said the supply chain pressures are included in its previously provided full-year guidance for earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.50 and for free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. The stock has shed 6.4% over the past three months, while the S&amp;P 500 
        SPX,

       has lost 7.2%., Gold is often thought of as a hedge against inflation, but it’s really protection against chaos—and the deepening Russia-Ukraine crisis certainly counts as chaos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> France Stocks Cut Gains </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The CAC 40 erased early gains to trade 0.2% lower at the 6,930 level on Friday, on course to its third consecutive session in the red amid negative corporate news and renewed concerns of a Russian invasion amid repeated ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine. On the corporate front, Hermes dropped 4.7% from reporting slower sales growth during the fourth quarter of 2021, mostly due to capacity constraints on its leather goods and saddlery divisions. At the same time, EDF fell 3.2% after announcing a rights issue that will raise EUR 2.5 billion to improve its financial structure, as the group struggles with low availability of its nuclear plant fleets due to corrosion and safety issues. On the other hand, Renault shares traded 2.6% higher after the automaker posted an operating margin of 3.6% for 2021, already exceeding its target set for 2023. Consequently, the group increased its margin target to 4% for 2022, despite the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wall Street Lower, Poised for Weekly Decline </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks were mostly down in early trading Friday, following the last session's meltdown as investors reacted to conflicting headlines regarding the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. In recent developments, Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces traded fresh accusations of cease-fire violations at Ukraine's border. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken agreed to meet with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov next week, hoping for a diplomatic solution. Aside from Russia-Ukraine rhetoric, investors focused on less hawkish signals from US Federal Reserve's last meeting minutes. The central bank would not raise interest rates yet but strongly indicated a hike is on the way as soon as March, while it will start unwinding its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. As a result, Wall Street is on track for its second weekly decline, with the Dow Jones down over 1% so far this week. The S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 are almost 1% down each. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Baltic Exchange Dry Index rose 4.1% to 1,964 on Friday, after three consecutive sessions of losses, amid an uptick in demand for the capesize and panamax vessel segments. The capesize index, which tracks iron ore and coal cargos of 150,000-tonnes, jumped 15.8% to 1,675; and the panamax index which tracks cargoes of about 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of coal and grains, edged up 10 points to 2,375. On the other hand, the supramax index increased fell 1 point to 2,325. The Baltic Dry Index dropped 0.7% for the week. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European Stocks Reverse Gains, DAX Down 1% </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> European equity markets reversed gains to trade lower in Friday’s afternoon trading, with Germany’s DAX losing 1% dragged down by renewed concerns over Russia-Ukraine tensions and led by an over 3% fall in Allianz shares after the company reported lower-than-expected earnings. The announcement of the evacuation of Donetsk People's Republic by Russian-backed separatist leader Denis Pushilin more than offset hopes the conflict in Ukraine could be resolved diplomatically after the US Secretary of State agreed to a meeting with Russia's foreign minister next week. On the corporate front, Renault exceeded its 2021 targets, showing upbeat profits; Sika posted a jump in full-year net profit and proposed a 16% higher dividend; Norwegian Air also reported a profit for full 2021; and Hermes grew slightly below market expectations. </td>

Market sentiment was also supported by the apparent easing of tensions in Ukraine, with a new meeting between Russia and the United States scheduled for the next week, although concerns peristed over separatist areas. Investors will also monitor corporate results from Neoenergia, Aeris, Rumo Logística and Cosan. </td>

But prices are still expected to go up, and conditions will probably continue to favor sellers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “Prices will continue to grow, just at a slower pace,” she said, and one of the main reasons is that mortgage rates are expected to rise. “Higher mortgage rates decrease affordability for anyone taking out a mortgage,” which the majority of home buyers do, she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage this week rose to 3.92 percent, the highest rate since May 2019, according to the mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac. A year ago, the average rate was 2.81 percent. Freddie Mac’s weekly survey looks at loans used to buy homes, rather than at borrowers refinancing loans they already have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Mortgage rates are rising quickly. The Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts average rates will be slightly above 4 percent by the end of the year — still low in historic terms, but higher than the 3 percent or lower that borrowers have been seeing. (The association includes rates for refinances as well as purchases in its forecast.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Why are rates rising? In response to higher inflation and a strong employment market, the Federal Reserve is expected in March to begin a series of increases in its benchmark interest rate, indirectly helping to push up mortgage rates. (In general, mortgage rates are tied to the 10-year Treasury bond, which is affected by various factors, including the outlook for inflation.) Consumer price increases recently have reached levels not seen in 40 years, mainly because of lingering supply constraints from the pandemic.                                                                                                                                             , The average borrower with a 20 percent down payment would pay about $100 more a month on a new mortgage than one taken out at the end of last year because of rising rates and higher home prices, said Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research strategy at Black Knight, a mortgage data provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Rates are rising as strong demand for homes, along with a tight supply of properties for sale, has pushed up home prices. The typical sale price of a previously owned home in 2021 was just under $347,000, according to the National Association of Realtors — an increase of nearly 17 percent from 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Shoppers should still expect a competitive spring housing market, Ms. Hale said. Some potential buyers who have been on the fence may move quickly to lock in mortgage rates before they rise further. “It gives shoppers some urgency to close sooner rather than later,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , But some shoppers — particularly first-time buyers — may decide to wait until even higher rates help cool off prices later in the year. The largest share of home buyers are millennials ages 21 to 40, many of whom are first-time buyers, according to the National Association of Realtors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “The spring season will be very interesting,” said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist with the Realtors association.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Ultimately, the housing market needs an increase in inventory, Mr. Yun said. “We need a supply of empty homes.” Builders have faced challenges in keeping newly built homes affordable including high lumber prices and difficulty finding construction workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Buyers may need to consider more affordable homes in less urban areas, Mr. Yun said. That may depend on whether homeowners expect to be able to continue working remotely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , One variable in the number of homes for sale is the winding down of mortgage forbearances granted during the pandemic. Many homeowners have been able to resume payments after their payment pause expired. But some may be unable to, forcing them to sell their homes, said Michael Fratantoni, the chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. The number of borrowers in forbearance has been declining, to an estimated 705,000 homeowners at the end of 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , As always with real estate, conditions vary. Agents in some hot markets say a rise in interest rates may take time to affect prices because some buyers don’t need financing to purchase homes. Kyle Schelvan, an agent with the Asa Team, part of eXp Realty, in Orlando, Fla., said homes in the area often were bought by people who had sold homes elsewhere and were using their cash proceeds to buy homes in Florida. Traditional buyers sometimes must take steps they once would have considered preposterous, he said — like buying a home occupied by a renter and waiting months for the lease to expire so they can move into the property. “It’s challenging,” he said., Here are some questions and answers about mortgage rates and the housing market:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, offer a fixed interest rate for a certain period before switching to a variable rate. The loans earned a bad reputation in the housing crisis in 2008 because some lenders gave them to unqualified buyers who couldn’t afford the higher payments when interest rates spiked. Lingering skepticism about adjustable loans, combined with low rates on fixed-rate mortgages in recent years, has kept ARMs out of favor, said Mr. Walden at Black Knight.                                                                                                                                                                                        , ARMs make up about 4 percent of the mortgage market, down from more than a third in 2005, said Mr. Fratantoni of the Mortgage Bankers Association.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Now, however, some home buyers may find ARMs attractive again, said Melissa Cohn, a regional vice president with William Raveis Mortgage who focuses on lending in the Northeast and Florida. The loans now offer more protections, she said, like longer periods before their rates can rise — five to 10 years — and caps on maximum rate increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , “It’s time to shift gears,” she said. Recently, she said, she helped clients get a 30-year ARM offering a fixed rate of 3 percent for 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Home price increases over the past few years have made saving a down payment more challenging, but the amount of cash required upfront is often less than the traditional rule of thumb of 20 percent. In 2021, the typical down payment for repeat home buyers was 17 percent of the purchase price, according to the National Association of Realtors. For first-time buyers, it was just 7 percent. Some programs allow down payments as low as 3 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The federal first-time home buyer credit, offered after the housing crisis, expired in 2010. Legislation was introduced in Congress in April to offer an expanded credit, under which eligible home buyers could get a federal tax credit of up to 10 percent of their home’s purchase price — to a maximum of $15,000. The bill’s prospects are uncertain. Some states offer their own tax credits or other help for first-time buyers.

Without a master account, nonbank financial institutions must partner with banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in order to tap those services.       , Reserve Trust had its master account application denied in June 2017; one year later, the application was approved. Toomey has noted that Raskin phoned Kansas City Fed President Esther George to advocate for the fintech company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , SARAH BLOOM RASKIN GRILLED OVER CONTROVERSIAL CLIMATE REGULATORY VIEWS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The Kansas City Fed claims that its reversal in 2018 was not the result of Raskin’s call, but rather that of Reserve Trust's changed business model "and the Colorado Division of Banking reinterpreted the state’s law in a manner that meant RTC met the definition of a depository institution," the Fed bank said last week.                                                                                                                                , Republicans, who say they want more time to vet Raskin, do not suggest that Raskin’s actions were illegal. Rather, they consider it an example of the "revolving door" between politics and corporate interests in which former government officials use their connections and clout in government to later lobby on behalf of businesses for a payout.                                                                                                         , Sarah Bloom Raskin, nominee to be vice chairman for supervision and a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, speaks before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on Feb. 3, 2022 in Washin (Ken Cedeno-Pool/Getty Images / Getty Images)                                                                                                                                                        , As vice chair for supervision, Raskin – a Duke University law professor who has held high-level jobs at both the Treasury Department and the Fed – would oversee annual stress tests that review bank safety and liquidity. Her nomination has been welcomed by progressive senators and advocacy groups, who think she will take a tougher stance against Wall Street than her predecessor, Randal Quarles, a Trump nominee who stepped down in late December. , Raskin served on the Fed's board from 2010 to 2014 and was tapped by former President Obama to serve as assistant Treasury secretary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Dennis Gingold, co-founder and former chairman of the Reserve Trust company, said in a statement to Bloomberg News last week that Raskin had "no role whatsoever" in appealing the Kansas City Fed’s initial denial of the firm’s request for a master account. He added that Raskin’s "conduct was appropriate, ethical and correct in every respect."                                                                                                         , CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Banking Chair Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, has refused to separate Raskin’s nomination from Biden’s other Federal Reserve picks, including the renomination of Jerome Powell as chair. The White House has indicated that it does not plan to withdraw Raskin's nomination.                                                                                                                                                                                           , "Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified people to ever be nominated to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve," the White House said in a statement. "Despite her qualifications, Senators Pat Toomey and Cynthia Lummis over the last several weeks have lobbed unfounded and unfair attacks at Raskin related to her time on the Board of Directors of Reserve Trust." </td>

Threats of an imminent Russian invasion in eastern Ukraine and the economic consequences of western retaliation were prevalent ahead of the meeting between the US Secretary of State and Russian Foreign Minister. On the monetary policy front, the Swiss National Bank remains committed to its ultra-loose monetary policy, as the latest labor data indicated that unemployment did not increase despite the Covid infection wave in January, while consumer inflation remains moderate. </td>

In recent developments, Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces traded fresh accusations of cease-fire violations at Ukraine's border. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken agreed to meet with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov next week, hoping for a diplomatic solution. Aside from Russia-Ukraine rhetoric, investors focused on less hawkish signals from US Federal Reserve's last meeting minutes. The central bank would not raise interest rates yet but strongly indicated a hike is on the way as soon as March, while it will start unwinding its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. </td>

The US and Iran suggested that an agreement of the 2015 nuclear pact is closer than ever, raising expectations the US will remove sanctions on Iran's oil and shipping which could mean the release of an extra 1 million supply barrels of oil to markets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Construction output in Italy jumped 19.3 percent year-on-year in December of 2021, the steepest growth rate since May and picking up from the upwardly revised 14.7 percent increase in the November. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, construction activity edged 0.3 percent higher, following an upwardly revised 1.9 percent in the prior month. Considering the annual growth rates, construction activity advanced 24.3 percent in 2021, largely due to limited construction output in 2020 during the pandemic. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The BSE Sensex ended 59.04 points or 0.1% lower to close at 57,833 on Friday, extending declines for the third straight session as investors remained cautious over the persistent Russia-Ukraine tensions. Moreover, domestic sentiment was slightly downbeat after the SBI in its Ecowrap research report estimated India’s GDP to grow by 5.8% during the October-December period of 2021 while it also revised lower the GDP growth rate to 8.8% for the full 2021-2022 fiscal year compared to its earlier estimate of 9.3%. Losses in capital goods and technology slightly outweighed the gains in banks and financials. Among the individual stocks, 17 out of 30 stocks on BSE Sensex ended in the red, with declines led by Ultra Cement Company (-1.88%), Mahindra and Mahindra (-1.36%), Infosys (-1.06%) and Reliance (-0.85%).

On top of that, the prospect of sanctions on Russia, a major producer of the metal, deepened concerns of diminished supply. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Ibex 35 traded around the flatline at the 8,660 mark on Friday, as investors weighed on fresh corporate news while monitoring geopolitical developments between Russia and Ukraine, amid claims of ceasefire violations by both Kyiv and Russian-backed separatists ahead of next week’s meeting between the Russian Foreign Minister and US Secretary of State. Siemens Gamesa shares fell 2% after Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch emphasized that the market environment in the onshore wind turbine business will remain difficult in the near future. At the same time, Anea dropped 2.1% after the Spanish competition authorities approved a 3.17% reduction in selected fees charged at the group’s airports. On the other hand, Banco Sabadell gained 2.6% after UBS upgraded its recommendation on the lender. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Aluminum hit a fresh all-time high of $3,313 amid dwindling inventories and concerns about further supply disruptions. The West's stand-off with Russia over Ukraine has raised prospects of sanctions on one of the world's largest metal suppliers, triggering a rush to aluminum stocks at LME warehouses, which currently sit at roughly 50% of March 2021 levels. Meantime, in China, the biggest producer and consumer of aluminum, the pandemic and pollution curbs amid the winter Olympics forced producers to halt production. As a result, the commodity rose more than 5% this week and is on track for its biggest weekly gain since early November. </td>

However, other major bourses in Europe extended gains to add around 0.4% each amid hopes the conflict in Ukraine could be resolved diplomatically after the US Secretary of State agreed to a meeting with Russia's foreign minister next week. Traders also digest fresh corporate results: Renault exceeded its 2021 targets, showing upbeat profits; Sika posted a jump in full-year net profit and proposed a 16% higher dividend; Norwegian Air also reported a profit for full 2021; and Hermes grew slightly below market expectations.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brent crude futures extended losses to more than 2% to around $91 per barrel on Friday and were headed for their first weekly decline since the second week of December, as the prospect of Iranian oil returning to the market outweighed fears of possible supply disruptions from a Russia-Ukraine conflict. Reuter reported that a deal to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is taking shape, with a draft accord outlining a sequence of steps that would eventually lead to granting waivers on oil sanctions, and bring about 1 million barrels a day of oil back to the market. Meanwhile, investors remain at the mercy of a volatile and tense standoff in Ukraine. Analysts expect oil to hold in the $90 to $100 a barrel range despite the potential return of Iranian oil exports, as geopolitical uncertainties and a tight global market, driven by capacity constraints and demand recovery continue to keep energy prices elevated. </td>

On the corporate front, financial stocks rebounded from losses in the previous session, carried by Banco Bpm (2.4%) and Banca Generali (1.5%). Meanwhile, Eni traded 1.1% higher after posting an adjusted net profit of EUR 4.74 billion in 2021 compared to a EUR 0.758 billion loss in 2020 for its strongest year since 2012, largely due to the rise in oil and gas prices during 2021. </td>

- What would stop the protestors to come back in two weeks when the cops are going to be exhausted?
- Thousands more have gone to Quebec City today. Waiting for the cops to leave in Ottawa. Making a tribute to the patriots getting arrested.
- Even my 3x vaxx 65 years old aunt who is the nicest person in the world now support the protest.
- WEF controlled medias have no credibility left in them.
- People are withdrawing there bank account money in cash... Block the account. There no money left in them.

Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told clients in a note this week not to worry, saying he doesn&amp;#39;t think a recession is on the horizon. 
The strategist stuck to his view that the S&amp;amp;P 500 will rise to 5,300 by the end of the year — one of the most bullish forecasts on Wall Street. The target is more than 20% above the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s Friday morning level of around 4,370. </td>

Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told clients in a note this week not to worry, saying he doesn&amp;#39;t think a recession is on the horizon. 
The strategist stuck to his view that the S&amp;amp;P 500 will rise to 5,300 by the end of the year — one of the most bullish forecasts on Wall Street. The target is more than 20% above the S&amp;amp;P&amp;#39;s Friday morning level of around 4,370. </td>

No more liquidity from the FED

FED has a big problem dealing with the Highest Inflation in decades trending towards Hyper Inflation.
The FED has to put on the brakes to slow the US Economy down by raising Rates possibly 7 times in 2022 according to JP Morgan Chase.
Higher borrowing costs for personal loans and mortgages and consumer auto loans and commercial loans and corporations and small businesses.

It will shred the Ponzi Sector. In the not-too-distant future, we will have a moment where oil goes parabolic and the NASDAQ detonates.

Oil is the wrecking ball that will crush every CUSIP, because the Fed will eventually panic. Look at bonds. They’re getting smashed along with equities today. This will blow up the Risk Parity boys. Their model says that bonds are supposed to hedge out risk-off periods in equities. As expected, their model stops working when inflation explodes.

Oil is the ring to rule them all. If you think European power prices are crazy, just consider it a dress rehearsal for what’s about to happen when oil goes parabolic.

- limit to ur losses by selling early 
- trust your instinct and take risks in doing so
- never let it all ride 
- the trend is your friend don’t swim against it or you’ll drown 
- move on quickly from a loss things can change in a day or hour and they always do 
- tech analysis is just one element of this

While small-scale conflicts are predicted to create worldwide impacts lasting 1 to 4 years, large conflicts would obviously have longer-lasting more severe impacts. Larger-scale conflicts, like those feared during the cold war between the US and Russia, would potentially detonate thousands of nuclear weapons.  These models predict that global temperatures would drop to an average of just above freezing year-round, lasting for around 10 years.  Limited effects would linger on for many decades past the initial nuclear winter, potentially disrupting food production for a whole generation. </td>

There will be an astounding number of clueless young bulls who will be dumbstruck as they continue to witness steep market declines despite there being no war. 
 
The government has them fooled into thinking the current market decline is war driven when it is caused entirely by late rate hikes and quantitative tapering. They will be confused all the way down because they got hoodwinked by the war distraction this government has orchestrated to hide those truly responsible for the incoming bear market: the fed and the government themselves.

In order not to look like Trump was right, that under Biden you would see the following:

&amp;gt; Increase Tensions Middle East, Russia and China
&amp;gt;Increase Inflation due to the drive up of OIL, yes OIL - We lost our independence under BIDEN
&amp;gt;Failed Border Protection 

Is the Russia Ukraine Conflict a distraction? 

I tried be Bullish on possible bounce last Thursday before another Russia/Ukraine scare only because was looking for bounce. 

It’s becoming more obvious now the QQQ and SPY has more downside risk due to the forming of multiple death crosses not only on the index but on many major stocks.

If Putin is indeed going to attack the Ukraine, my assumption would be that he attacks on Monday evening Eastern time. Which would be an early morning attack in Europe. He has to wait for the Olympics to be over so not to insult China. But he wants to take advantage of the US markets being closed. Salvos on all fronts.  But he needs to know that we have sanctions across the board… Just not in energy… LMAO!   Meanwhile Putin is winning off the US dollar and has more gold reserves than dollar reserves. And he’s moving towards a gold backed digital currency. HMMMM. Rumour has it that China is also putting their oil production backed against gold. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Looking for clues and seen that the indices could make (1) more run before March FOMC. Possibly back to the trend line where they’ve been repeatedly rejected. It’s a tricky situation because we could start the week down and with Januarys low for $QQQ only $5 below current price the risk is high however, it would cause too much panic selling if things accelerated at the start of next week in my opinion. If price reversed to go back to the trend line there could be a rejection at $353 which lines up with the start of the downtrend starting Jan 4th. This is just an analysis based on price action - it’s a possible scenario that could happen not a prediction that it will happen exactly how I think. I hope everyone makes money with whatever strategy they use… </td>

When the stimulus started I talked about what munger is saying and people laughed at me, my wife thought I was a nut job, and I lost friends.

It&amp;#39;s just a history lesson, but people don&amp;#39;t know their history. I feel people are distracted with nonsense overall. This crisis stinks and it&amp;#39;s just beginning unless the fed is ready to do some serious rate hikes.

There’s an image floating around showing that liquidity is shrinking, basically lower than 2020 levels “big money is selling” but retail is not convinced anything is wrong for some reason they are still “bullish”. Lowering their price target since Jan $500 next week, $480 next week, $475, $465, $450 $448. Sure we can always trade the volatility but “going long” right when the indices could fall below Jan low again “before March FOMC” and balance sheet reduction……sounds like a GAMBLE not a “well thought out plan” </td>

AAPL Happy Saturday everyone! Hopefully you&amp;#39;re taking some time off to enjoy the weekend. It was a choppy week and we&amp;#39;ll wait and see how tensions in Russia/Ukraine play out. Do you think anything will happen before markets open on Tuesday? 
 
I like to use this time to step back, reset, and prepare for the week ahead (DD, news, rumors, etc.) 
 
One of the most important things to track is social momentum and social sentiment. When a ticker starts to gain traction, more people see it , and it can start to take off. When this happens it usually leads to increased price action and volume. Remember, at the end of the day the market is set by whatever price some is willing to buy and sell at.  
 
This is why we build this social sentiment dashboard, so you can stay ahead of the trends an movements. It is one of the most useful indicators for investing and trading. Check it out - happy to answer any questions. https://utradea.com/social-dashboard?utm_source=stocktwits&amp;amp;utm_medium=ssd-stocktwits&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sm_202202019 </td>

In the meantime, it&amp;#39;s going to experience a lot of naysayers who don&amp;#39;t think the company can achieve its growth goals. I bought Palantir at $38. Does that make me an idiot? Maybe, but I bought it where I thought it was worth a lot more than its valuation. The general public now disagrees. One thing I&amp;#39;m certain about is that the general public is completely idiotic. Hence why 40 years ago shares of apple were selling for a penny on the $20. </td>

My thoughts on the stock mkt next week ... 

When I  alerting everyone on ST back in early Feb 2020 of a mkt crash coming (SEE POST BELOW), the mkt was at all-time h8ghs. First day of 2022  I alerted subscribers of  an incoming mkt correction. 

The game plan hasn&amp;#39;t changed. Institutions still need retail investors to &amp;quot;btfd&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s the only way they can unload without crashing the mkt.  It is easy to do - prop up the mkt &amp;quot;Generals&amp;quot; - AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, NVDA, GOOGL, etc and create the illusion that the mkt is healthy. This game began long before January. 

Many still contunue to buy the rallies. They continue to fall into the same trap of early 2020

 I called the crash two years ago. I called the sharp correction to start 2022. My members know this and have benefited from this insight. When it&amp;#39;s time to get bullish from my standpoint, they will know as well.

Since President Biden took office, Taliban is back and stronger then ever. China is backing away from trade deals and now  Russia is invading remaining Ukraine. Not to mention, Iran will soon be able to do as it pleases with trade and economic embargoes lifted. All so called US foreign &amp;quot;enemies&amp;quot; are making drastic  moves.  

Not necessarily saying it&amp;#39;s all Biden&amp;#39;s fault and that he has to interfere with activities on foreign soil as people are free to make their own choices, but the optics sure don&amp;#39;t look good for him.  Sadly things will get much worse, and we are still going through a pandemic.

My thoughts on the growth stocks and where we are headed  .... 

Back in May of 2021, I wrote a blog (SEE BELOW) for my subscribers that warned of high growth stocks being extremely overvalued and that they would have a severe correction.  Below is an excerpt. 

I have made a habit of getting ahead of big stock mkt moves. As I did in Feb of 2020 when mkts were at all-time highs,  I was warning of a crash to come. As I did to begin this year, when I called for a stock mkt correction. And as I did last May, when I warned of the demise in these high growth names that have been absolutely destroyed. ROKU, UPST, MRNA, SHOP, etc. 

For those of you who continue to subscribe to my site, I am grateful and I will continue to do my best to provide content that is ahead of Wall Street. For those interested in joining, feel free to email me at

TSLA Happy Saturday everyone! hopefully you&amp;#39;re taking some time off to enjoy the weekend. Choppy week and we&amp;#39;ll wait and see how tensions in Russia/Ukraine play out. What are your thoughts? 
 
I like to use this time to step back, reset, and prepare for the week ahead (DD, news, rumors, etc.) 
 
One of the most important things to track is social momentum and social sentiment. When a ticker starts to gain traction, more people see it , and it can start to take off. When this happens it usually leads to increased price action and volume. Remember, at the end of the day the market is set by whatever price some is will to buy and sell at.  
 
This is why we build this social sentiment dashboard, so you can stay ahead of the trends an movements. It is one of the most useful indicators for investing and trading. Check it out - happy to answer any questions. https://utradea.com/social-dashboard?utm_source=stocktwits&amp;amp;utm_medium=ssd-stocktwits&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sm_202202019 </td>

My thoughts on the stock mkt next week ... 

When I  alerting everyone on ST back in early Feb 2020 of a mkt crash coming (SEE POST BELOW), the mkt was at all-time h8ghs. First day of 2022  I alerted subscribers of  an incoming mkt correction. 

The game plan hasn&amp;#39;t changed. Institutions still need retail investors to &amp;quot;btfd&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s the only way they can unload without crashing the mkt.  It is easy to do - prop up the mkt &amp;quot;Generals&amp;quot; - AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, NVDA, GOOGL, etc and create the illusion that the mkt is healthy. This game began long before January. 

Many still contunue to buy the rallies. They continue to fall into the same trap of early 2020

 I called the crash two years ago. I called the sharp correction to start 2022. My members know this and have benefited from this insight. When it&amp;#39;s time to get bullish from my standpoint, they will know as well.

Senior U.S. and European ministers are meeting Saturday as tensions rise over Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine 
 
 
 Countries in Europe including France, Germany and the U.K. are also sounding increasingly frantic warnings, while Russia denies it plans an invasion and calls such claims propaganda and “hysteria.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to travel to Germany to speak at the Munich Security Conference, where he’s also expected to meet with U.S. officials including Vice President Kamala Harris.  
 
Moscow and Kyiv continue to trade allegations of violations of a shaky cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. That measure was put in place as part of efforts to halt an armed conflict that broke out in 2014 between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukrainian military. The government in Kyiv refuses to negotiate with the separatists, saying they are proxies for Moscow.

Thank good for project veritas exposing the FDA saying that Biden plans on mandating yearly Covid shots…now maybe they won’t go through with it…

At this point the science says the Covid shot only protects you, it doesn’t even immunize you, only protect the individual from severe symptoms…so why are they trying to force it on everyone to “protect” other people…There is truly no logical reason other then money…pure evil. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $IPOF I see a lot of chatter about spacex and them splitting their stock as a private company. This happens all the time and it&amp;#39;s done for the employee stock plan. 
Most employees don&amp;#39;t have the brains 🧠 or balls 🏀 🏀 to ask how many shares outstanding when they interview as all that matters is % ownership and that&amp;#39;s how u compare across companies. Instead they focus on absolute shares like 10k shares . A split let&amp;#39;s a company give more shares in either options or rsu with a lower % ownership so less dilutive 

Same top of mentality like the idiots at $LCID who say if $TSLA is 900 we should at least be 100 🤦‍♂️🙄

If u get stock or options at a future company ask for the shares outstanding (private companies don&amp;#39;t have to tell u but they will if u ask) </td>
