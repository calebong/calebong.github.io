But it may be its unlikeliest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The film — whose distributor, Angel Studios, has a big success with “The Chosen,” a streaming series about the life of Jesus — was the third most watched film in North America last weekend. Its $19.7 million weekend take was behind only the horror film “Insidious: The Red Door,” which made $33 million in its first weekend, and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which made $27.4 million in its second.                                                                                                                                                , “Sound of Freedom” is based on a true story: Caviezel plays Tim Ballard, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent who investigated pedophiles. (Ballard later founded the anti-trafficking group Operation Underground Railroad, became a frequent guest on Fox News and was appointed by former President Donald J. Trump to a federal advisory panel on human trafficking.)                                                                                                                                                                                        , Some critics say the film appeals to the QAnon movement, which posits a false conspiracy theory accusing progressive elites of pedophilia. The Guardian called it a “QAnon-adjacent thriller.” A Rolling Stone article said that its “mainstream accessibility makes it valuable as a recruitment tool.” In an interview, Neal Harmon, Angel’s chief executive, said: “Anybody who watches this film knows that this film is not about conspiracy theories,” adding, “it’s not about politics.”                                                                          , Caviezel, who played the title role in Mel Gibson’s 2004 film “The Passion of the Christ,” seemed to allude to QAnon while promoting the film on the podcast of Stephen K. Bannon, saying “there is a big storm coming,” a movement motto, and mentioning “adrenochrome,” a hormone that QAnon adherents say elites harvest from their child victims.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , A representative for Caviezel did not reply to a request for comment. Nor did Operation Underground Railroad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Though not explicitly faith-based like other Angel projects — including the “The Chosen” and “His Only Son,” a recent film about Biblical patriarchs — “Sound of Freedom” stands as the latest instance of an entertainment industry success story that targeted an audience that is often overlooked by Hollywood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The film, which was independently produced for $14.5 million, has grossed more than $41 million from its domestic release on Tuesday, July 4, through last weekend, according to Comscore. Unusually, it made slightly more on Sunday than Saturday, a Comscore media analyst said. Angel Studios’ unorthodox “Pay It Forward” program, which lets supporters go online to purchase tickets for those who might otherwise not see the film, may have helped. So might its emerging status as a political football: championed by the right, reviled by left-wing critics., Angel, which is based in Provo, Utah, relies on crowdfunding to boost its projects. More than 7,000 “angel investors” raised $5 million in exchange for revenue-sharing to help market “Sound of Freedom,” the company said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “We believe that the model of the Hollywood gatekeeper system, of selecting content, doesn’t choose the content that people want to watch,” said Jared Geesey, Angel’s senior vice president of global distribution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The producer of “Sound of Freedom,” Eduardo Verástegui, and its director and co-writer, Alejandro Gómez Monteverde, hail from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, Verástegui said in an interview, and most of the financing came from Mexican backers. It was filmed in 2018. Its original distributor, Fox Latin America, dropped it after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox in 2019. (A Disney spokesman said the studio never knew about the film.) It was picked up earlier this year by Angel, which describes itself as a values-based studio.                        , Verástegui, the producer, acknowledged the polarization around the film. He, too, promoted it on Bannon’s podcast. But he said he hoped political differences could be shelved in favor of the movie’s anti-trafficking message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , The film, which is a little over two hours, does not mention specific QAnon tenets. Hitting many typical action-movie beats, it depicts trafficking and related problems like child sexual abuse imagery as stark and growing, and suggests thatthe international wealthy are among its consumers. Its featured actors include Bill Camp and Mira Sorvino in a small role as Ballard’s wife.                                                                                                                                                                             , During the credits, Caviezel addresses the audience, saying the filmmakers hope “Sound of Freedom” will be “the ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ of 21st century slavery.” He adds, “We believe this movie has the power to be a huge step forward toward ending child trafficking.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Marc Tracy is a reporter on the Culture desk.

In other words, it spells out who gets your stuff and in what amounts. Parents with minor children can also nominate a legal guardian for their kids.                                                                                                           , You also name an executor in your will to ensure your wishes are followed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , If someone dies without a legal will, it means they die "intestate." Each state has laws that determine how an estate's property is divided in those circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Franklin didn't have a formal, typewritten will. Instead, she jotted down her wishes on two handwritten wills — one dated in 2010 and another in 2014. Both were discovered in Franklin's Detroit home months after the Queen of Soul's death from pancreatic cancer in 2018.                                                                                , Franklin, who died at age 76, had four sons. The current legal dispute is between her sons, who disagree over which handwritten will should govern their mother's estate. Their jury trial started Monday.                                                                                                                                                   , One son, Ted White II, thinks the 2010 will should control the estate, while two other sons, Kecalf Franklin and Edward Franklin, favor the 2014 document, according to the Associated Press.                                                                                                                                                                , There are differences between the documents. For instance, the 2014 version says Kecalf Franklin and grandchildren would get his mother's main home in Bloomfield Hills, valued at $1.1 million when she died, according to the AP. However, the 2010 version splits the home evenly between White and Kecalf Franklin.                                      , Both wills seem to indicate the sons would share income from music and copyrights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Certain states such as Michigan recognize handwritten wills — also known as holographic wills — as valid if they meet specific criteria, said Charlie Douglas, a certified financial planner and president of HH Legacy Investments in Atlanta.                                                                                                              , Generally, the more recent will takes precedence over an older one, Douglas said. If a jury determines Franklin's 2014 will, which was found in a notebook under a couch cushion, as valid, it would supersede the 2010 document, found in a locked cabinet.                                                                                                 , "There are too many ways it could go wrong," Behrendt said of drafting a do-it-yourself will. "This [proceeding] will be talked about in law schools in every state in the country.                                                                                                                                                                          , "This is why you don't want to do it on a note pad," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , A will is superseded in some cases, such as with beneficiary designations on retirement accounts, Douglas said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , That may also happen if a decedent owns property in "joint tenancy," whereby two or more people own the property together, Douglas said. Let's say a married couple owns an investment account in joint tenancy. This legal arrangement dictates that the surviving spouse inherits the account, taking precedence over the language in a will, Douglas said., "You have to also look at how your assets are titled," Douglas said. "Because the will may or may not control [them]."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , When someone dies, the executor presents their will to the court as part of a "probate" proceeding. The will and its contents become a matter of public record, Behrendt said.                                                                                                                                                                               , People who would like to keep the details of their estate plan private — especially celebrities and those with wealth — may prefer to use a trust instead, Behrendt said. Using a revocable trust is essentially the same as a will, but it allows you circumvent the courts, he said.                                                                       , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Brazilian real traded around $4.9, slightly down from an over one-year high of $4.8 touched on June 21st, on rising bets of interest rate cuts. The annual inflation in Brazil slowed to 3.16% in June from 3.94% in May; while prices fell 0.08% on monthly terms, the first deflation registered since September of last year. The annual inflation rate is now below the bank’s 3.25% target for this year, supporting expectations that the central bank will start cutting rates as soon as next month. In its June meeting, the central bank said that an August cut was possible if the positive inflation scenario continued. Meanwhile, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expects the Senate to pass a proposed tax reform restructuring Brazil's complex consumption taxes, which gained the lower house's approval last week, by 2023 end. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The JSE FTSE All Share index rose about 0.7% to close at a near one-week high of 74,877 on Tuesday, along with its global peers, amid hopes of fresh stimulus in China and prospects that prolonged tightening cycles of major central banks were close to an end. Heavyweight resource-linked stocks, retailer Shoprite and industrials posted the biggest gains. On the domestic data front, South Africa's manufacturing output advanced by a more-than-expected 2.5% year-on-year in May, the second consecutive increase, following six consecutive months of decline. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lumber Holds Close to 5-Month High </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lumber futures traded near $550 per thousand feet, remaining close to the highest level since February on limited supply and expectations of stronger demand. The shipments from Canada, the US's biggest supplier, are expected to decline after wildfires have led to a record-breaking 9.2 million hectares of forest burned so far this season. This comes on the back of production cutbacks in British Columbia and a slowdown in European wood shipments. Meanwhile, there are signs that the US housing market is recovering. The scarcity of existing homes in many markets has contributed to the growing demand for new construction, even in the face of higher interest rates. Housing starts unexpectedly jumped by 21.7% month-over-month in May, reaching a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.631 million. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> French Stocks Outperform Peers </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The CAC 40 index extended early gains to close about 1.1% higher at 7,220 on Tuesday, the third session of increases and outperforming its regional peers. Almost all listed companies finished in the green, with Unibail-Rodamco-We (+4.2%), Saint Gobain (+4%) and Teleperformance (+3.4%) booking the largest gains. Also. China's exposed luxury stocks such as LVMH (+2.2%), Hermes (+2%) and Kering (+1.6%) advanced firmly. Market sentiment was buoyed by hopes of immediate stimulus from Beijing to support an economy that is struggling to recover, and expectations the Federal Reserve was nearing the end of its interest rate hiking cycle. Meanwhile, traders cautiously awaited the US inflation data due on Wednesday, as well as the ECB accounts and the start of the second-quarter earnings season later in the week. </td>

Leveraging the popularity and scale of its existing products, the company intends to make the new social platform a success. In doing so, it also plans to squash a leading competitor’s app.                                                                                                                                                           , If this sounds like Instagram’s new Threads app and its push against its rival Twitter, think again. The year was 2011 and Google had just rolled out a social network called Google+, which was aimed as its “Facebook killer.” Google thrust the new site in front of many of its users who relied on its search and other products, expanding Google+ to more than 90 million users within the first year.                      , But by 2018, Google+ was relegated to the ash heap of history. Despite the internet search giant’s enormous audience, its social network failed to catch on as people continued flocking to Facebook — and later to Instagram and other social apps.                                                                                                                                                                               , In the history of Silicon Valley, big tech companies have often become even bigger tech companies by using their scale as a built-in advantage. But as Google+ shows, bigness alone is no guarantee of winning the fickle and faddish social media market.                                                                                                                                                                         , This is the challenge that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, now faces as he tries to dislodge Twitter and make Threads the prime app for real-time, public conversations. If tech history is any guide, size and scale are solid footholds — but ultimately can only go so far.                                                                                                    , What comes next is much harder. Mr. Zuckerberg needs people to be able to find friends and influencers on Threads in the serendipitous and sometimes weird ways that Twitter managed to accomplish. He needs to make sure Threads isn’t filled with spam and grifters. He needs people to be patient about app updates that are in the works.                                                                                      , In short, he needs users to find Threads compelling enough to keep coming back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “If you launch a gimmick app or something that isn’t fully featured quite yet, it might be counterproductive and you could see a lot of people churn right back out the door,” said Eric Seufert, an independent mobile analyst who closely watches Meta’s apps.                                                                                                                                                                   , For the moment, Threads appears to be an overnight success. Within hours of the app’s introduction last Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg said 10 million people had signed up for Threads. By Monday, that had soared to 100 million people. It was the first app to do so in that time frame, exceeding the chatbot ChatGPT, which gained 100 million users within two months of its release, according to the analytics firm Similarweb., Mr. Seufert, the mobile analyst, called the numbers that Threads had racked up “objectively impressive and unprecedented.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Elon Musk, who owns Twitter, has appeared agitated by Threads’ momentum. With 100 million people, Threads is quickly surging toward some of Twitter’s last public user numbers. Twitter disclosed it had 237.8 million daily users last July, four months before Mr. Musk bought the company and took it private.                                                                                                                  , Mr. Musk has taken action. On the same day last week that Threads was officially unveiled, Twitter threatened to sue Meta over the new app. On Sunday, Mr. Musk called Mr. Zuckerberg a “cuck” on Twitter. Then he challenged Mr. Zuckerberg to a contest to measure a specific body part and compare whose was larger, alongside an emoji of a ruler. Mr. Zuckerberg has not responded.                                           , (Before Threads was announced, Mr. Musk separately dared Mr. Zuckerberg to fight a “cage match.”)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , What Mr. Musk lacks at Twitter, Mr. Zuckerberg has in abundance at Meta: enormous audiences. More than three billion users regularly visit Mr. Zuckerberg’s constellation of apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.                                                                                                                                                                                          , Mr. Zuckerberg has had plenty of experience nudging millions of people in those apps to use another of the apps. In 2014, for instance, he removed Facebook’s private messaging service from inside the social network’s app and forced people to download another app, called Messenger, to continue using the service.                                                                                                           , Threads is now tied closely to Instagram. Users are required to have an Instagram account to sign up. People can import their entire following list from Instagram to Threads with just one tap of the screen, saving them from trying to find new people to follow on the service.                                                                                                                                                , On Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg suggested there was more he could do to push Threads’s growth. He had not “turned on many promotions yet” for the app, he wrote in a Threads post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Some users have wondered why Threads seems to have made its debut without some basic functions that are used inside Instagram, like a search function that allows people to browse trending hashtags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , “There are a lot of features Threads did not launch with, possibly by design, to keep it brand safe” and minimize controversy from the start, said Anil Dash, a tech industry veteran and writer. “What does that do to the long-term interesting-ness of the network?”                                                                                                                                                            , Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said in a Threads post on Monday that there was a running list of new features to add to the new app that people have requested. “They say, ‘make it work, make it great, make it grow,’” he wrote, adding, “I promise we will make this thing great.”                                                                                                                                        , Yet bolting on a new app to a company’s existing products can eventually run out of steam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , In 2011, after Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and its chief executive at the time, cloned Facebook with Google+, users soon grew bored of the novelty of the new social network and stopped using it. Some saw Google+ as something that was forced on them while they were just trying to gain access to their Gmail.                                                                                                            , Former Google employees described the product as “fear-based,” built only in response to Facebook and without a clear vision of why people should be using it instead of a competing network. In a post-mortem of what went wrong, one ex-Googler wrote that Google+ mainly defined itself by “what it wasn’t — i.e. Facebook.”                                                                                                    , Of course Mr. Zuckerberg could pull a Bill Gates with Threads. Mr. Gates, a founder of Microsoft, built his empire on Windows, the operating system that powered a generation of personal computers — and then successfully used that scale to crush competitors.                                                                                                                                                                  , Once Windows dominated PCs, Mr. Gates famously bundled other products with the software for free. When he did that in 1995 by packaging the web browser Internet Explorer with Windows, Internet Explorer soon turned into the default browser on millions of computers, overtaking the then-dominant browser, Netscape, in just four years.                                                                                       , Even so, Mr. Gates was eventually stung by the tactic. In 1998, the Justice Department sued Microsoft for unfairly using Windows’ market power to snuff out the competition. In 2000, a federal judge ruled against Mr. Gates’s company, saying Microsoft had put an “oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune.”                                                                                                       , Microsoft later settled with the government and agreed to make concessions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent and the author of “Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,” a best-selling book on the dramatic rise and fall of the ride-hailing company.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Italian Stocks End Higher </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE MIB index rose about 0.7% to close at 28,062 on Tuesday, notching its third session of gains, mainly boosted by shares of Moncler (+2.9%), Tenaris (+2.8%), Interpump Group (+2.3%) and Iveco Group (+2.3%). Investors welcomed reports from official Chinese media of imminent new support measures for the economy, while also digesting recent comments from Fed officials that further rate hikes will be necessary, but the end of the monetary tightening cycle draws near. The focus now turns to US inflation figures due on Wednesday that will certainly influence the Fed's monetary policy. On the domestic data front, industrial production in Italy rebounded by 1.6% over a month in May 2023, the first rise in five months, surpassing market forecasts of a 0.7% increase. </td>

That strategy is spearheaded by the agency’s chair, Lina Khan, who has argued that Big Tech’s vast influence over commerce and communications has led to anticompetitive behavior. The F.T.C. has sued Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, but it walked away from one of its cases against Meta and has had little to show for its efforts so far., Microsoft and Activision cheered the ruling. “We’re grateful to the Court in San Francisco for this quick and thorough decision,” Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, wrote on Twitter. Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a statement that the merger would “enable competition rather than allow entrenched market leaders to continue to dominate.”                                                                          , Douglas Farrar, a spokesman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that the agency was “disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services and consoles.” Mr. Farrar added that “in the coming days we’ll be announcing our next step to continue our fight to preserve competition and protect consumers.”                                                                    , The ruling lifts the temporary ban on closing the deal just before midnight on July 14, unless the F.T.C. obtains an extension from an appeals court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , There were also indications on Tuesday that the tide may be shifting in favor of Microsoft in Britain, which presented the other major hurdle to the acquisition. Regulators there had blocked the deal, saying it would stifle competition in streaming games online. But on Tuesday, Microsoft said it was pausing its formal appeal of that ruling to negotiate a settlement.                                                                          , The regulator, called the Competition and Markets Authority, said in a statement that it was open to a proposal that would address its concerns, giving Microsoft significant momentum to complete its acquisition as soon as next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , From the start, the F.T.C. appeared to be fighting an uphill battle against Microsoft, which said early last year that it would buy Activision in an effort to reshape its video game business and bring marquee games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft to its Xbox platform.                                                                                                                                                                      , Courts have been concerned that mergers involving direct competitors will harm competition, but Microsoft and Activision are generally not considered direct competitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The F.T.C. sued Microsoft in its administrative court last year, but that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal from closing. In June, the F.T.C. asked Judge Corley to take that step, saying it feared Microsoft was on the verge of completing the transaction despite the government’s concerns.                                                                                                                                   , Over five days of testimony last month, the F.T.C. called high-profile witnesses like Mr. Kotick and Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, as it made the case that the merger would be bad for gamers and for competition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The F.T.C. argued that Microsoft had significant incentives to make Activision’s Call of Duty — a franchise with more than $30 billion in lifetime revenue — exclusive to the Xbox, withholding it from Sony’s PlayStation or degrading PlayStation versions of the game.                                                                                                                                                                                 , But Microsoft said it had signed deals with companies like Nintendo to offer Call of Duty on other platforms, and had offered Sony a deal as well. Microsoft argued that it would have no incentive to risk angering gamers by reneging on its commitments to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation, and that it would lose out on a significant amount of revenue by cutting off PlayStation players.                                                         , Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , At times, Judge Corley seemed skeptical of the F.T.C.’s case. During closing arguments, she pressed the agency repeatedly to back up its claim that if Call of Duty was withheld from PlayStation, enough players would abandon PlayStation for Xbox to make the move worthwhile for Microsoft.                                                                                                                                                           , “The F.T.C. has not shown it is likely to succeed on its assertion the combined firm will probably pull Call of Duty from Sony PlayStation, or that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition in the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets,” Judge Corley wrote in her decision.                                                                                                                       , “To the contrary,” she added later, “the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , She wrote that despite “extensive discovery,” including close to one million documents and 30 depositions, the F.T.C. “has not identified a single document which contradicts Microsoft’s publicly stated commitment to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation (and Nintendo Switch).”                                                                                                                                                                , Her denial of a preliminary injunction means Microsoft could complete its merger with Activision as soon as this month in the United States. The companies set a July 18 deadline for the deal, with Microsoft required to pay Activision a $3 billion breakup fee if the deal does not go through by then. The companies could agree to delay that date, or they could merge while their appeal in Britain is pending.                                   , It was the F.T.C.’s latest loss in a case involving one of the tech giants. While legal challenges under Ms. Khan caused companies like Lockheed Martin and the chip maker Nvidia to drop proposed acquisitions early in her tenure, the agency was unsuccessful this year in challenging Meta’s purchase of a virtual reality start-up.                                                                                                                  , Ms. Khan has said she won’t be deterred by courtroom losses. The chair and her allies believe that regulators were too risk-averse for years, leading to runaway corporate consolidation. They have said the F.T.C. and other government agencies must be willing to pursue novel cases even if they are not guaranteed wins.                                                                                                                             , In her ruling, Judge Corley argued that consumers benefited from Microsoft’s expectation of a tough review, making agreements in writing and under oath to share Activision games with different consoles and streaming services. “That scrutiny has paid off,” she wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                , Kellen Browning is a technology reporter in San Francisco, where he covers the gig economy, the video game industry and general tech news.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canadian Dollar Gains Ahead of BoC Decision </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Canadian dollar strengthened towards the 1.32 per USD mark, moving towards the nine-month high of 1.315 touched on June 22nd, as investors eagerly awaited the outcome of the Bank of Canada's policy meeting on Wednesday. The central bank is anticipated to implement an additional 25 basis points rate hike, bringing its policy rate to a 22-year high of 5%, amid policymakers' efforts to steer inflation back towards their target. In May, Canada's headline inflation rate moderated to 3.4% and the core reading slowed more than expected to 3.7%, alleviating worries of sticky inflation. At the same time, investors dumped the US dollar amid signs that the Federal Reserve is nearing the end of its current monetary policy tightening cycle. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Canola futures in Canada rose to above CAD 765 per tonne in July, the highest in nearly two months, amid concerns the dry weather in the Canadian Prairies could hurt 2023/24 production. Canadian farmers reported planting 22.1 million acres of canola in 2023, up 3.2% from the previous year, according to a report from Statistics Canada released later in June. Canada is the world's largest single-country producer and shipper of canola. Meanwhile, global demand for oilseeds and vegetable oils is set to remain robust, but concerns about a global economic slowdown amid high interest rates and a faltering recovery in China have been weighing on the markets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Swiss franc appreciated to 0.88 against the USD, touching its strongest level since January 2021, as investors dumped the greenback after Federal Reserve officials signaled that the central bank was nearing the end of its tightening cycle. At the same time, concerns over a global economic recession due to sticky inflation and borrowing costs at multi-year highs boosted demand for safe haven currencies. The Swiss National Bank hiked its key rate by 25bps to 1.75% in June and flagged another potential rate increase in September, underscoring that risks of second-round effects to inflation remain high despite the current slowdown in headline and core figures. The bank has also reiterated it was ready to intervene in the FX market if needed to support the franc. </td>

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It also has to pay about $80.4 million to customers who were unfairly charged bogus fees, on top of the $23 million it already paid to customers who were improperly denied card awards., "These practices are illegal and undermine customer trust," CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in the release.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note fell below 4%, retreating for the second consecutive session after hitting its highest since November 2022 at almost 4.1% as investors turned cautious ahead of key economic data that could influence the Federal Reserve’s next interest rate policy moves. The CPI report on Wednesday is expected to show headline annual inflation fell to 3.1% in June from 4% in the previous month, while the core index probably decreased to 5% from 5.3%. Markets are now pricing in a 94.9% chance of rates being hiked again during the central bank’s upcoming meeting on July 25-26 but uncertainty remains for the other three Fed meetings scheduled for later in the year. In the latest Fed commentary, Fed President Mary Daly said that she expects two further rate hikes to be announced this year to lower inflation, in line with early comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index in the US unexpectedly fell to 41.3 in July 2023, the lowest since November, compared to 41.7 in June and market forecasts of 45.3. It also marks the 23rd consecutive month that the reading stands below 50, indicating that Americans remain pessimistic. The economy continues to be the number one issue for Americans as they prepare for earnings season and new inflation data. The Personal Financial Outlook, a measure of how Americans feel about their own finances in the next six months, fell to 50 from 51.9  and the gauge for Confidence in Federal Economic Policies edged lower to 38.5 from 38.6. On a positive note, the Six-Month Economic Outlook rose to 35.5 from 34.5, as optimism slightly increased for the long term, but it’s still a long way from positive. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazil’s Ibovespa stock index fell nearly 2% to trade below the 116,000 level on Tuesday, not seen since early June, mainly pushed down by heavyweight Petrobras (-1.5%).  The company said on Monday it requested access to petrochemical firm Braskem's virtual data room to start the due diligence process for the possible exercise of preference in the purchase of shares. Also, banks were under pressure, led by Itaú (-2.4%), Bradesco (-1.8%) and Santander (-1.5%). In the meantime, GOL shares underperformed, plunging more than 7%, along with CVC Brasil (-5.1%) and Petz (-4.9%). Furthermore, investors weighed new economic data, while awaiting the crucial US inflation data and the start of the earnings season later in the week. On the domestic data front, Brazil's annual inflation slowed to 3.16% in June from 3.94% in May, broadly in line with a market consensus of 3.17%; while prices fell 0.08% on a monthly basis, the first deflation registered since September of last year. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US stocks were higher on Tuesday, attempting to extend Monday's gains, although investors refrain from making big bets ahead of the key inflation report due tomorrow. The Dow Jones gained over 150 points, with Salesforce jumping almost 4% after the company announced it will be increasing list prices an average of 9% in August. 3M and Caterpillar were also among the top performers. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.2%, led by the energy and materials sectors, while the Nasdaq was trading near the flatline. Traders were also digesting comments from several Fed officials which continued to point to the need of further tightening this year. The odds for a 25bps increase in the fed funds rate this year currently stand at 95%, but investors remain divided about another rate hike. The economic calendar is soft today and the earnings season kicks off later in the week. </td>

Warren Buffett's big energy and utility division bought the stake from Dominion Energy and will now own a 75% limited partnership stake in Cove Point LNG located in Lusby, Maryland. A subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners holds the remaining 25% .                                        , While the deal, which was announced Monday, isn't large in size for Berkshire, it builds on a growing bet on energy infrastructure at the conglomerate as it gains control of one of the rare functional facilities in the U.S. that can export LNG.                                                      , "It builds on their long-term theme of energy resources becoming more valuable and ownership of one of only a few US LNG exporters," said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust and a Berkshire shareholder.                                                                             , The Cove Point LNG Terminal has a storage capacity of 14.6 billion cubic feet and a daily send-out capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet. The firm has a long-term contract with Sumitomo Corp., a Japanese trading company that Buffett also invested in.                                                   , Berkshire Hathaway first bought a stake in Dominion's gas pipeline and storage assets for $4 billion in 2020. Greg Abel, Berkshire Hathaway Energy's chairman and former CEO, previously told CNBC the deal in 2020 was made through a strong relationship he had with the prior Dominion CEO Tom Farrell., Abel is now vice chairman for noninsurance operations at Berkshire Hathaway and the successor to the 92-year-old "Oracle of Omaha." Buffett said Abel has taken on many of the responsibilities at the conglomerate.                                                                                      , In 2022, Berkshire proposed spending nearly $4 billion to help generate more wind and solar power in Iowa. At the same time, the conglomerate has been dramatically increasing its exposure to two traditional energy companies — Occidental Petroleum and Chevron.                                       , "Buffett has liked pipelines for a long time, given their toll bridge-type revenues rather than pure commodity exposure, and this is likely similar," Stone said. "Natural gas prices are down a ton, but I think most of these exporters work on long-term take or pay contracts."                       , Natural gas futures have fallen more than 40% this year to $2.709 per million British thermal units.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The annual inflation rate in Belarus eased to 2.9 percent in June 2023 from 3.7 percent in May, logging the fresh historical low due to the slowdown in the food cost (3.6 percent vs 4.4 percent in the previous period) and fall in non-food items prices (-1 percent vs 0.9 percent), Meanwhile, inflation for services remained unchanged (at 6.9 percent). On a monthly basis, consumer prices edged up by 0.3 percent, following the 0.3 percent decline in May. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Russia’s current account surplus narrowed sharply to USD 5.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 from USD 76.7 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year, according to preliminary estimates. It was the lowest surplus since Q3 2020, underscoring the large extent of narrowing of the Russian current account since hitting its record-high of USD 76.7 billion in Q2 2022, as Western sanctions and global recession concerns pressured prices of Moscow’s key oil and gas sales. The goods surplus shrank to USD 24.1 billion from USD 95.0 billion, as the goods exports tumbled to USD 101 billion from USD 151.8 billion. In addition, the services deficit widened to USD 8.5 billion from USD 3.6 billion and the aggregate primary and secondary income account posted a USD 10.2 billion gap, largely due to lower dividends declared by Russian companies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazilian Inflation Drops to Near 3-Year Low of 3.2% </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The annual inflation rate in Brazil receded to 3.16% in June of 2023 from 3.94% in the prior month, the lowest since September 2020 and broadly in line with market forecasts. It was the fourth consecutive month that Brazil recorded an inflation rate below the central bank’s upper tolerance band of 4.75%. The moderation in overall inflation was primarily driven by a steeper decline in prices for transportation (-5.68% vs -4.75%), of which fuels (-26.35% vs -25.86%) and further cooling in prices of food &amp; beverages (4.01% vs 5.54%), helped by a bumper harvest. There was also a slowdown in prices of clothing (9.66% vs 11.11%), healthcare &amp; personal care (10.37% vs 11.62%), personal expenses (6.97% vs 7.11%), among others. On a monthly basis, Brazilian consumer prices edged down by 0.08% in June, the first drop since last September, also matching market estimates. Downward pressure came mostly from prices of food &amp; beverages (-0.66%), transportation (-0.41%) and household items (-0.42%). </td>

According to new data from the Energy Information Administration, gas demand increased from 9.306 to 9.599 million b/d in the last week of June. Meanwhile, total domestic gasoline stocks decreased by 2.55 million bbl to 219.5 million bbl, well above expectations of a 1.42 million barrel draw. Further supporting gasoline prices, WTI crude futures have been rising toward 2-month highs boosted by supply cuts by top exporters of Saudi Arabia and Russia for August. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index in the United States went up to a seven-month high of 91 in June 2023, beating again market expectations of 89.9. Among the key findings, 24% of owners reported that inflation was the single most important problem in operating their business, down 1 point from last month. Still, only net 29% reported higher selling prices, the least since March 2021, and the percentage of owners who expect real sales to be higher improved by 7 points to -14%. Looking further, fewer firms expect worst business conditions over the next six months (+10 points to -40%) and fewer reported job openings were hard to fill (-2 points to 42%). Still, the index remained below its 49-year average of 98 for the past 18 months, as inflation and labor shortages continue to be great challenges. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> China June Bank Loans Beat Forecasts </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> China's banks provided CNY 3.05 trillion in new yuan loans in June 2023, a substantial increase from CNY 1.36 trillion in the previous month and well above market expectations of CNY 2.34 trillion. It was also the largest amount of new bank loans for a June month since at least 2004, as demand for credit increased after the People's Bank of China reduced its key lending rates on June 20th for the first time since August. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR), which is the medium-term lending facility used for corporate and household loans, was lowered by 10bps to 3.55%; while the five-year rate, a reference for mortgages, was trimmed by the same margin to 4.2%. At the same time, total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to CNY 4.22 trillion up from CNY 1.56 trillion in the previous month and above market expectations of CNY 3.0 trillion. </td>

Traders will also look to the ECB accounts on Thursday and the first batch of quarterly earnings from the US on Friday. On the domestic data front, industrial production in Italy rebounded by 1.6% over a month in May 2023, the first rise in five months, surpassing market forecasts of a 0.7% increase. Among single stocks, top performers were Moncler, Banca Monte Paschie Siena and Erg, with gains of over 2% each. By contrast, Recordati Ord (-0.9%), Saipem(-0.8%) and Telecom Italia (-0.4%) posted the biggest declines. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany dropped to -14.7 in July 2023 from the previous month's reading of -8.5 and below market expectations of -10.5. Morale hit its weakest level since last December, as investors predicted a further deterioration in the economic situation by year-end due to the expectation of rising short-term interest rates in the Eurozone and the US. Additionally, important export markets like China are seen as relatively weak. The industrial sectors are likely to bear the brunt of the anticipated economic downturn, with profit expectations for these export-oriented industries experiencing a substantial decline once again. Meanwhile, the gauge measuring the assessment of the economic situation declined once again, dropping to -59.5 in July from June's reading of -56.5. </td>

But the problem has only gotten worse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Freight trains frequently block roads nationwide, a phenomenon that local officials say has grown steadily worse in the last decade as railroads run longer trains and leave them parked on tracks at crossings. The blockages can turn school drop-offs into nightmares, starve local businesses of customers and prevent emergency services from reaching those in distress.                                                                                                                                   , The problem has persisted despite numerous federal, state and local proposals and laws because the freight rail industry wields enormous political and legal power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Courts have thrown out several state laws seeking to punish rail companies for blocking traffic, ruling that only the federal government can regulate railway crossings. No federal laws or rules penalize railways for blocking crossings, and congressional proposals to address the issue have failed to overcome opposition from the rail industry.                                                                                                                                                          , A bipartisan bill that was introduced in Congress in March, after a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, called for regulators to issue rules for trains carrying hazardous materials that would “reduce or eliminate blocked crossings.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But that provision was stripped before the Senate commerce committee advanced the bill in May. The legislation, which awaits a vote by the full Senate, now would require only a National Academy of Sciences study on blocked crossings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Rail lobbyists had argued that the provision was unrelated to the issues raised by the Ohio accident and pressed sympathetic senators to remove it, according to four people familiar with the negotiations over the bill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Speaking on the day of the committee vote, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate and a former rail lobbyist, criticized the blocked crossing provision. “This bill should have been about safety reforms relevant to the derailment in East Palestine, but now it’s been expanded to a stalking horse for onerous regulatory mandates and union giveaways,” he said.                                                                                                            , Senators who supported the provision agreed to take it out to gain more Republican support and bolster the bill’s chances, the four people said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The freight rail industry is dominated by four U.S. companies — Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, CSX and BNSF — and two Canadian ones, Canadian Pacific Kansas City and Canadian National. The U.S. railroads and the Association of American Railroads, a trade group, have spent about $454 million on federal lobbying over the past two decades, according to a New York Times analysis of federal lobbying disclosures. That is about $30 million more than the four largest airlines and their trade group., Mr. Thune has received about $341,000 in campaign contributions since 2010 from railroad employees and political action committees, according to an analysis by OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics. He served as the railroad director for South Dakota from 1991 to 1993 and worked as a lobbyist for several companies including the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad for two years after a failed Senate bid in 2002, according to disclosure forms.                                           , The senator declined to comment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The Senate’s unwillingness to take on the rail industry was not surprising to Daniel Lipinski, a former House Democrat from Illinois.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , In 2020, he introduced a bill that would have placed limits on how long rail companies could block crossings, and levied penalties for trains that exceeded those limits. The idea made it into a House infrastructure bill. But the Senate removed the provision after the Association of American Railroads said it would “lead to unintended consequences, including network congestion and reductions in service.”                                                                                           , “The state or local governments can’t do anything,” said Mr. Lipinski, now a consultant and a fellow at the University of Dallas and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. “The federal government is not doing anything about the crossings, and that’s the way the railroads would like to keep it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The infrastructure law, which passed in 2021, did provide grants for “railroad crossing elimination” projects, primarily to put roads under or over tracks. Local officials said those grants would fix only a small number of crossings that freight trains frequently blocked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , There is no thorough accounting of how often trains block the country’s more than 200,000 rail crossings. People can make reports to a website maintained by the Federal Railroad Administration. There were 30,803 reports last year, up from 21,648 in 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Texas, Ohio and Illinois had the most incidents. Some blockages may be reported more than once, but local officials contend that the database greatly undercounts blockages. York residents say they typically don’t report blocked crossings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In a response to questions, the Association of American Railroads attributed blocked crossings to local governments, which, it said, had routed roads across railway tracks rather than over or under them, an approach that other industrialized countries had taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , John Gray, a senior vice president at the association, said in a statement that railroads had taken steps to reduce the impact of blocked crossings. “The real solution is not a question of technology or operational practices by either the railroad or public agencies,” Mr. Gray said. “It is a public infrastructure investment similar to what has taken place in the rest of the developed world for more than a century and a half.”                                                                    , Local officials and some railway employees said that explanation was self-serving. They link the rise in blocked crossings to a pursuit of bigger profits — Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX and Norfolk Southern have made $96 billion in profits in the last five years, 13 percent more than in the previous five years. The big railroads’ profit margins significantly exceed those of companies in most other industries.                                                                                          , In search of greater efficiency, railroads have been running longer trains. As a result, when those trains are moved, assembled and switched at rail yards, they often spill over into nearby neighborhoods, blocking roads, local officials and workers said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Crews have a better sense of the space that shorter trains take up, said Randy Fannon Jr., a national vice president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union, who also oversees its safety task force. Longer trains are more difficult to maneuver on single-track railroads. Such railroads have sections of track, or sidings, where trains can pull aside to allow other trains to pass, but those sections are not big enough for very long trains, Mr. Fannon said.                  , “If you’ve got two 5,000-foot trains or one 10,000-foot train, you cut your locomotive use in half and your train crew in half,” he said. “That’s all this is about — profit.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , In York, trains stop and block roads when they use a siding that runs through the town. Residents say the company could move the siding into the surrounding countryside. The railroad association has listed new sidings as a way to tackle blocked crossings in its own materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , “They have no incentive” to make that change, said Willie Lake, York’s mayor and a former federal bank regulator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Connor Spielmaker, a Norfolk Southern spokesman, said in a statement that the company had worked with York to reduce the disruptions. When asked whether Norfolk Southern could move the siding, he declined to comment, except to say the company already uses sidings outside the town and had created a position to work on problems like blocked crossings.                                                                                                                                                  , “The only way to eliminate stopping at a railroad crossing is to eliminate the crossing itself,” Mr. Spielmaker said. He noted that Norfolk Southern wrote a letter in February to the Transportation Department in support of a federal grant application by York to build an overpass and said it would collaborate with York on future grant applications.                                                                                                                                                    , In June, York learned that its applications for two federal grants had been rejected. “It’s a punch in the gut,” Mr. Lake said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Officials at the Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration, one of the department’s agencies, declined to say whether they could issue rules penalizing railroads for blocking crossings. A spokesman for the railroad administration, Dan Griffin, said the railroads should fix the issue without being required to.                                                                                                                                                                , “The duration and prevalence of blocked railroad crossings are the result of a rail company’s operating practices,” he said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The blockages are unrelenting in York — and sometimes extreme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , On a sweltering election day in June 2022, a train blockage lasted more than 10 hours, forcing many people, some old and ill, to shelter in an arts center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Carolyn Turner, 51, said stopped trains had trapped her in her neighborhood several times, making her late for dialysis appointments 30 miles away and causing great stress. “I like to go there and get back and help out with my grandbabies,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The town’s population is mostly Black, and some residents said that might explain why its rail crossings were often blocked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , “If you really want to see them squirm, tell them: ‘How many white people’s communities do you do this in?’” Jessie V.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The euro continued to strengthen and surpassed the $1.10 level, reaching its highest point since May 8. Investors believe that the European Central Bank has more work to do in order to address inflationary pressures in the Eurozone, despite data indicating a slowdown in economic growth and easing inflation across the region. In June, Germany's inflation rate was confirmed at 6.4%, breaking the trend of a steady decline observed since the beginning of the year, due to a low base effect last year. Meanwhile, in the broader Eurozone, inflation has decreased to a 17-month low of 5.5%. However, core indicators remain consistently elevated, surpassing the ECB's target of 2%. Presently, interest rates in the bloc stand at 3.5%, but pricing in derivatives markets suggests that traders anticipate them to rise to a peak of 4% or higher by early next year. </td>

The USDA Crop Progress Report showed corn was rated 55% good to excellent in the first week of July, up 4 percentage points from 51% the week before, although remaining the lowest for this time of year since 2012. At the same time, the Acreage report from the USDA estimated that 94.1 million acres of corn would be planted in the United States in 2023, up 6% from last year, with growers expecting to harvest 86.3 million acres of corn for grain, up 9% from 2022. The US is by far the world's largest producer and exporter of corn and the key growing region of the Midwest has been facing a severe dry weather that could have compromised the corn crop, but July offered move favourable weather conditions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Turkey Current Account Gap Widens in May </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Turkey’s current account deficit widened to $7.93 billion in May 2023 from $5.83 billion in the corresponding month of the previous year and compared with market expectations of $7 billion. The goods account deficit rose to $10.5 billion from $8.8 billion in the previous year, while the services account surplus decreased slightly to $3.85 billion from $3.94 billion. On the other hand, the primary income gap expanded to $1.3 billion from $0.86 billion, while the secondary income swung to a surplus of $0.09 billion from a $0.89 billion shortfall. Excluding gold and energy, the current account posted a $ 1.28 billion deficit, shifting from a $1 billion surplus in the corresponding period last year. Meanwhile, according to official forecasts announced in September 2022, Ankara expects a deficit of $22 billion this year, which is less than halved compared to last year's $48.8 billion, which was again largely driven by energy and gold. </td>

And for our bank, a 25% credit growth would be a fair expectation with stable asset quality."                                                  , Last week, IDFC First Bank said the proposed merger would boost the bank's standalone book value by 4.9% compared with its financials as of March 31. It also said it aims to increase its balance sheet by 20% to 25% per year in the near to medium term.     , "The merger will lead to simplification of the corporate structure of IDFC FHCL, IDFC Limited and IDFC FIRST Bank by consolidating them into a single entity and will help streamline the regulatory compliances of the aforesaid entities," the release added. , Vaidyanathan noted the bank has key "strategic goals" and since the "Indian market is so large and wide and we're still a tiny player, we think that we can grow at a good rate for a long time to come with a holding like this."                              , Still, the deal is subject to approvals from India's key regulatory authorities, including the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India and India's stock exchanges.                                                                       , Analysts have noted the recent merger will not dent IDFC First Bank's prospects for inclusion in the MSCI standard index for August.                                                                                                                            , Inclusion in the index "would be a big deal," said Vaidyanathan. "Whether we make it now or later in our mind, we have no doubt. We are very confident and frankly, it'd be an honor to be part of MSCI index for us," added the CEO.                           ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE 100 traded flat to lower on Tuesday, following a 0.2% increase in the previous session as investors weigh strong wage data, while mining stocks are benefiting from optimism surrounding China's supportive measures. Export-oriented firms were pressured by a stronger pound, after the latest data showed regular pay which excludes bonus payment went up 7.3%, the same as in the prior month, maintaining pressure for higher interest rates. Among single stocks, British Land gained more than 2% after the commercial property firm said it still expects strong operational momentum despite macroeconomic uncertainty.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> European Shares Rise for 2nd Day </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> European shares rose for a second consecutive session on Tuesday as investors digested key economic data while anticipating the US CPI figures on Wednesday and the start of the US earnings season later in the week. Germany's inflation rate in June was confirmed at 6.4%, breaking the trend of a steady decline since the beginning of the year. Additionally, the UK unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4% in the three months leading up to May, while wage growth rates exceeded expectations. Investors are now optimistic that signs of further moderation in price pressures in the US will reinforce expectations for the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle to come to an end. Furthermore, traders are hopeful for a new round of easing measures in China as part of efforts to bolster the country's property sector. On the corporate front, Daimler Truck has raised its profit and revenue guidance due to an easing of supply chain constraints and stronger demand in its core markets. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chinese Yuan Gains on Dollar Weakness </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The offshore yuan appreciated past 7.2 per dollar, its strongest levels in over two weeks amid a general greenback weakness, as Fed officials signaled that the end of the current monetary tightening cycle is getting close despite indicating that they will likely raise interest rates further to bring down inflation. At the same time, investors get increasingly optimistic the Chinese authorities will unveil stimulus measures to shore up a weakening recovery. The PBOC and the National Financial Regulatory Administration extended a policy released last year aiming to support the real estate market, which allows developers to postpone or swap their loans. Last week, the PBOC also said it will continue to keep the yuan basically stable and guard against the risk of large exchange rate fluctuations. Meanwhile, latest data showed that consumer inflation in China unexpectedly flattened in June, while producer inflation fell the most since 2015. </td>

The two sides are haggling over the same issues that are front and center for the Writers Guild of America: higher wages, increased residual payments (a type of royalty) and significant guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence.                                                                                                                                          , Should the actors go on strike, it will be the first time in 63 years that both the actors and the writers are out at the same time over a contract dispute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Hollywood is already 80 percent shut down since the writers went on strike on May 2. While some television shows and movies continued filming, the writers were surprisingly effective in shutting down shows in production. If the actors join them on the picket lines, productions will be closed completely, a reality that will have a significant effect on the local economies in Los Angeles and other filming locales like Atlanta and New York City. During the last writers’ strike 15 years ago, the Los Angeles economy lost an estimated $2.1 billion., The effects of a dual strike would also soon be coming to your television, with network shows going into reruns and a likely proliferation of reality television. Also, actors would no longer be able to promote new films, a reality that already exists to a large degree because the writers’ strike forced the late-night shows to go dark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Not since Ronald Reagan was the president of the Screen Actors Guild have the writers and actors been on strike at the same time. Back then, the actors were fighting over residuals paid for licensing films for television. Today, the actors want to ensure higher wages and better residuals in an entertainment landscape in which studios are struggling to turn a profit after investing billions of dollars in streaming. The actors are also concerned about how their likenesses could be used with the advent of artificial intelligence.                , Guild members authorized the strike in early June, with 97.9 percent of members voting yes. Then on June 24, Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of the guild, informed its membership that they “remained optimistic” about the talks. They added that the negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the trade association negotiating for the studios, had been “extremely productive.”                                                                      , A video prompted a group of more than 1,000 actors, including Ms. Drescher, to sign a letter that urged the union’s leadership to not settle for a lesser deal. “We are prepared to strike,” the letter said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , On June 30, the union announced that it had extended its contract until Wednesday while the sides continued to talk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , After the parties negotiated all weekend, it remained unclear whether they were any closer to a resolution. Should they fail to make an agreement by midnight Pacific time on Wednesday, some 160,000 SAG-AFTRA members will be poised to join the 11,000 writers already on the picket line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Nicole Sperling is a media and entertainment reporter, covering Hollywood and the burgeoning streaming business.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The British pound extended gains and touched the $1.29 mark, its strongest level since April 2022, after hotter-than-expected pay growth data added pressure on the Bank of England to keep raising interest rates. British wages, excluding bonuses, were 7.3% higher in the three months to May than a year earlier, the largest increase seen outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, and above forecasts of 7.1%. Total pay growth has also accelerated to an all-time high of 6.9% when excluding the COVID-19 pandemic period. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4%, and employment gains came in below forecasts. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Monday that policymakers had to "see the job through" on bringing down the inflation rate, suggesting the continuity of the central bank's aggressive policy tightening campaign. </td>

The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, stood at 5.8% in June, up from 5.4% in May. Inflation accelerated for energy (3.0% vs. 2.6%), mainly due to a low base effect last year, especially for solid fuels (26.6%), natural gas (20.8%), electricity (10.5%), and district heating (9.3%). Also, services inflation rose (5.3% vs 4.5%), with rent increasing 2.0%, the same pace as in May. Meanwhile, food inflation softened (13.7% vs 14.9%). On a monthly basis, consumer prices were up 0.3% in June. The CPI harmonized compared with other European countries, climbed 6.8% on the year, and a 0.4% rise month-on-month. </td>

At the same time, traders braced for interest rate decisions by the RBNZ Wednesday, with hopes growing that the central bank may hold steady its cash rate at 5.5% after 12 straight hikes since late 2021 and join its global counterparts in pointing out that future moves will depend on economic data. In the US, equities closed higher Monday as investors prepared for US inflation data this week. Meanwhile, comments from Fed officials Monday reinforced views that the central bank may raise interest rates further, but it could be near the end of its tightening path.

Meanwhile, the harmonized CPI which is used to compare prices with other EU member states, slowed to 6.4%, down from a prior 6.8%. On a monthly basis, the CPI dropped 0.3%, following a 0.2% growth in the previous month. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Dollar Weakens to 2-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The dollar index fell to around 101.8 on Tuesday, hitting its weakest levels in two months as several US central bank officials said they will likely raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, but the end of the current monetary policy tightening cycle is getting close. Markets are currently priced for a 25 basis point rate increase this month, while doubts persist on the need for further hikes. US consumer inflation expectations for the year ahead also fell for a third consecutive month to 3.8% in June 2023 from 4.1% in May, the lowest in over two years. Investors now look ahead to US consumer inflation data on Wednesday and producer inflation numbers on Thursday for more clues on the economy and the path for interest rates. The dollar fell the most against the British Pound which touched the $1.29 mark, its strongest level since April 2022. Also, the Swiss Franc hit $0.88, closing on the strongest since January 2015 and the Yen touched a 4-week high of $140. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The New Zealand dollar rose by 0.2% to a near four-week high of $0.6223 on Tuesday, strengthening for the third straight session, as the US dollar softened to its lowest level since mid-May after comments from Fed officials bolstered the view that the US central bank may be near the end of its tightening path. Locally, the RBNZ, which is constantly on alert for domestic inflation outlook even after delivering a total of 525bps since late 2021, will hold its monetary policy meeting Wednesday. Early indications showed that the annual inflation in the nation has started to ease, standing at 6.7% in Q1 of 2023 after hitting an over 3-decade high of 7.2% in the prior period but remains more than twice the central bank’s target range. Adding to the upside momentum were reports that China, New Zealand's largest trading partner, stepped up support for its struggling property market while planning to launch measures to boost business confidence. </td>

Financial regulators, including the country's central bank, reportedly stepped up pressure on lenders to ease terms for property companies by encouraging negotiations to lengthen outstanding loans, Bloomberg News said. In a statement, the PBoC and the National Financial Regulatory Administration also said the government may launch measures to boost business confidence. On Wall Street overnight, markets snapped a three-day losing streak, as hopes grew that US inflation data this week could support an imminent end to rate hikes. All sectors contributed to the upturn, with basic materials, consumer cyclicals, tech, and property among early performers. Shenzhou Intl.

Meanwhile, business conditions steadied at above-average levels (at 9), as the survey's measure of sales fell a point to a still-strong 14, while the employment index stayed at 5 and profits rose two points to 9. Forward orders, a leading indicator of demand, rose three points to -2. In a sign of easing supply chain pressures, the survey's measure of capacity utilization fell to its lowest since early last year at 83.5%. Labor costs jumped to 2.6% in quarterly terms, possibly reflecting firms factoring in minimum and award wage increases, while input cost growth remained at 2.3%. "We continue to see warning signs in the survey about the outlook for growth but as of June firms were yet to see a real deterioration," said NAB chief economist Alan Oster. </td>

Last week, Saudi Arabia said it would extend its 1 million barrels-per-day cut to August, while Russia said it would cut oil exports by 500,000 bpd next month. In the US, authorities announced that they plan to purchase about 6 million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with receipts scheduled for October and November 2023. Meanwhile, investors remain cautious ahead of key US inflation data and Chinese trade figures this week that could guide the demand outlook. The prospect of further interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve also continued to weigh on market sentiment. </td>

That creates a risk for U.S. business," said Michael House, partner at Perkins Coie and based out of offices in Beijing and Washington, D.C.     , "And when there is no real opportunity for the two governments to talk about the reason for that action or at the government level try to get some better read on what's motivated those kinds of actions, that becomes then detrimental for U.S. business when that kind of opportunity doesn't exist," House said., When it comes to industries, he pointed out, advanced technology and its links to the military are a concern to the U.S. and China, while other sectors bear less risk.                                                                                                                                             , The new Espionage Law expands the "acts of espionage" definition to include "seeking to align with an espionage organization" and attempts to illegally obtain data related to national security, according to an English-language translation on China Law Translate, a website Daum founded.                      , The law also calls on "all levels" of government in China to educate and manage related security precautions, according to the translation.                                                                                                                                                                         , The website's translation of the Foreign Relations Law notes that foreign organizations in China "must not endanger China's national security, harm the societal public interest, or undermine societal public order."                                                                                              , The uncertainty lies in implementation. News of the laws came as reports of Chinese probes into foreign firms made headlines from March to May.                                                                                                                                                                     , Chinese authorities raided the office of U.S. corporate due diligence firm Mintz Group in Beijing, visited U.S. consultancy Bain &amp; Company's office in Shanghai and investigated international consulting firm Capvision Partners, according to Reuters.                                                            , It's not clear how extensive the investigations were, or what exactly prompted the probes despite a general link to national security. No other reports of similar raids at major foreign companies have since emerged.                                                                                             , But the ambiguity remains a concern for businesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he's brought up the corporate raids in his meetings with Chinese officials.                                                                                                                                                              , "This is one of the disconnects where we usually hear, is as long as you're not doing anything illegal you have nothing to worry about," Hart said. "But it's unclear to us what these companies did that was considered illegal. We continue to call for more transparency."                                       , Blinken and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have both met with U.S. businesses in China during their visits this year.                                                                                                                                                                                         , Companies also face increased scrutiny on the U.S. side. A House committee delegation discussed China business in their meeting with executives of high-profile U.S. tech and media companies in California in April.                                                                                               , The term national security has been increasingly cited by the U.S. and Chinese government in new restrictions for businesses over the last few years.                                                                                                                                                               , For businesses in China, the biggest concern is that everything from food to energy is given a security angle, Jens Eskelund, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, said at a briefing in mid-June.                                                                                                     , "That I think creates uncertainty about what are the exact borders between what falls under a security purview and something we can operate as normal businesses."                                                                                                                                                  , Cultural and language differences also play a role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "The Chinese approach [to national security] is more defensive and domestic while the U.S. understandings are very global," said Alex Liang, partner at Anjie &amp; Broad in Beijing.                                                                                                                                   , "For example, China generally focuses on whether sensitive information is leaked across the border, while U.S. normally focuses whether its allies provide technology to its rivalries and certain target nations," he said.                                                                                        , Bernstein says buy this China-based personal finance stock that can rally nearly 60%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Morgan Stanley names 2 chip stocks with 'significant upside' as China bans Micron                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , This fund puts a spin on emerging markets investing with bets from Nvidia to Chinese spirits                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The role of law and the court system also have fundamentally different statuses in the U.S. and China. Beijing has been trying to build up its legal system in recent years, but the government is ruled by one party.                                                                                              , Perkins Coie's House pointed out that since the U.S. courts are able to rein in what the enforcement part of the government is doing, a Chinese company could make a legal dispute about national security-driven actions — something difficult for a foreign company to do in China.                               , He said foreign businesses in China could also consider having more dialogue with their local regulators, so they have a better understanding of what a company is doing and how it's contributing to the economy.                                                                                                  , China's Ministry of Commerce on Wednesday met with foreign pharmaceutical companies, and said it would hold regular roundtables with foreign businesses to support their operations.                                                                                                                                , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Colombia Inflation Rate Eases to 9-Month Low </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The annual inflation rate in Colombia slowed for the third straight month to 12.13% in June 2023 from 12.36% in prior and below market expectation of 12.20%. It was the lowest reading since September 2022, as food prices continued to rise at the slowest pace in 19 months (14.31% vs 15.66% in May). Cost eased further for and housing &amp; utilities (8.07% vs 8.13%); furnishings &amp; household equipment (14.61% vs 15.53%), miscellaneous goods &amp; services (14.38% vs 14.68%), and restaurants &amp; hotels (17.43% vs 18.01%) and health (11.26% vs 11.31%). Conversely, prices accelerated for other CPI items such as transportation (18.19% vs 17.82%), alcoholic beverages &amp; tobacco (11.70% vs 11.58%). On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.3% in June, the least in 20 months, following a 0.43% gain in the previous month. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> UK Retail Sales Growth Accelerates in June </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Retail sales in the United Kingdom rose 4.2% on a like-for-like basis in June 2023 from a year ago, accelerating from a 3.7% gain in May as warm weather prompted consumers to buy summer goods despite persistent pressure from inflation and higher interest rates. Still, much of the increase was driven by upward pressure on overall spending from inflation, masking a drop in sales volumes. Helen Dickinson, chief executive at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Sun-seekers headed to their favorite retailers to buy swimwear and beach towels, and outdoor games, garden furniture and barbecue food were boosted as families came together to celebrate Father’s Day.” Meanwhile, Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG said that “consumers have so far remained resilient, but the triple threats of further interest rate hikes, resolute double digit food inflation and an economy recovering at slower rate than predicted, could hamper a return to much needed profitable growth across the retail sector.” </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Equities in New Zealand fell 21.02 or 0.18% to an over-one-week low of 11,891.71 in early deals on Tuesday, retreating for the second day in a row as investors were cautious ahead of a monetary policy decision Wednesday by the RBNZ, which is known as the most hawkish central bank in the world with a total of 525bps rate hikes since late 2021. Also, uncertainty about fresh stimulus in China, New Zealand's main trading partner, made investors reluctant to enter riskier assets. A strong session on Wall Street Monday capped the bearish sentiment, as traders awaited US CPI and producer inflation data later this week. Utilities, technologies, and communication services were mainly lower, with notable losses from Contact Energy (-0.98%), Chorus (-0.91%), and ANZ Group (-0.24%). In contrast, Infratill fell by 0.49% after signing an agreement to buy an initial 80% stake in Console Connect, owned by Hong Kong Telecom. </td>

Democratic Reform Caucus and includes a co-founder and former treasurer of the union, reflects a growing split within the union that appears to have undermined its ability to pressure Amazon. The split has also threatened to sap the broader labor movement of the momentum generated by last year’s high-profile victory.                , In its complaint, the reform caucus argues that the union and its president, Christian Smalls, illegally “refuse to hold officer elections which should have been scheduled no later than March 2023.”                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The complaint asks a federal judge to schedule an election of the union’s top officers for no later than Aug. 30 and to appoint a neutral monitor to oversee the election.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Mr. Smalls said in a text message Monday that the complaint was “a ridiculous claim with zero facts or merit,” and a law firm representing the union said it would seek legal sanctions against the reform group’s lawyer if the complaint was filed.                                                                                                                                                        , The complaint states that under an earlier version of the union’s constitution, a leadership election was required within 60 days of the National Labor Relations Board’s certification of its victory.                                                                                                                                                                                                      , But in December, the month before the labor board certification, the union’s leadership presented a new constitution to the membership that scheduled elections after the union ratifies a contract with Amazon — an accomplishment that could take years, if it happens at all.                                                                                                                             , On Friday, the reform caucus sent the union’s leadership a letter laying out its proposal to hold prompt elections, saying it would go to court Monday if the leadership didn’t embrace the proposal.                                                                                                                                                                                                        , The reform group is made of up more than 40 active organizers who are also plaintiffs in the legal complaint, including Connor Spence, a union co-founder and former treasurer; Brett Daniels, the union’s former organizing director; and Brima Sylla, a prominent organizer at the Staten Island warehouse.                                                                                                , The group said in its letter that enacting the proposal could “mean the difference between an A.L.U. which is strong, effective, and a beacon of democracy in the labor movement” and “an A.L.U. which, in the end, became exactly what Amazon warned workers it would become: a business that takes away the workers’ voices.”                                                                              , Mr. Smalls said in his text that the union leadership had worked closely with its law firm to ensure that its actions were legal, as well as with the U.S. Labor Department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Jeanne Mirer, a lawyer for the union, wrote to a lawyer for the reform caucus that the lawsuit was frivolous and based on falsehoods. She said that Mr. Spence had “improperly and unilaterally” replaced the union’s founding constitution with a revised version in June 2022, and that the revision, which called for elections after certification, had never been formally adopted by the union’s board., Retu Singla, another lawyer for the union, said in an interview that the constitution was never made final because there were disagreements about it within the union’s leadership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Mr. Spence said he and other members of the union’s board had revised the constitution while consulting extensively with the union’s lawyers. A second union official involved in the discussions corroborated his account.                                                                                                                                                                                  , The split within the union dates from last fall, when several longtime Amazon Labor Union organizers became frustrated with Mr. Smalls after a lopsided loss in a union election at an Amazon warehouse near Albany, N.Y.                                                                                                                                                                                    , In a meeting shortly after the election, organizers argued that control of the union rested in too few hands and that the leadership should be elected, giving rank-and-file workers more input.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The skeptics also complained that Mr. Smalls was committing the union to elections without a plan for how to win them, and that the union needed a better process for determining which organizing efforts to support. Many organizers worried that Mr. Smalls spent too much time traveling the country to make public appearances rather than focus on the contract fight on Staten Island.                , Mr. Smalls later said in an interview that his travel was necessary to help raise money for the union and that the critics’ preferred approach — building up worker support for a potential strike that could bring Amazon to the bargaining table — was counterproductive because it could alarm workers who feared losing their livelihoods.                                                               , He said a worker-led movement shouldn’t turn its back on workers at other warehouses if they sought to unionize. A top union official hired by Mr. Smalls also argued that holding an election before the union had a more systematic way of reaching out to workers would be undemocratic because only the most committed activists would vote.                                                             , When Mr. Smalls unveiled the new union constitution in December, scheduling elections after a contract was ratified, many of the skeptics walked out. The two factions have operated independently this year, with both sides holding regular meetings with members.                                                                                                                                         , In April, the reform caucus began circulating a petition among workers at the Staten Island warehouse calling on the leadership to amend the constitution and hold prompt elections. The petition has been signed by hundreds of workers at the facility.                                                                                                                                                    , The petition soon became a point of tension with Mr. Smalls. In an exchange with a member of the reform caucus on WhatsApp in early May, copies of which are included in Monday’s legal complaint, Mr. Smalls said the union would “take legal action against you” if the caucus did not abandon the petition.                                                                                               , The tensions appeared to ease later that month after the union leadership under Mr. Smalls proposed that the two sides enter mediation. The reform caucus accepted the invitation and suspended the petition campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                       , But according to a memo that the mediator, Bill Fletcher Jr., sent both sides on June 29 and that was viewed by The New York Times, the union leadership backed out of the mediation process on June 18 without explanation.                                                                                                                                                                                 , “I am concerned that the apparent turmoil within the ALU E. Board means that little is being done to organize the workers and prepare for the battle with Amazon,” Mr. Fletcher wrote in the memo, referring to the union’s executive board. “This situation seriously weakens support among the workers.                                                                                                    , Noam Scheiber is a Chicago-based reporter who covers workers and the workplace.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Brazil’s Ibovespa stock index lost 0.8% to close around 117,930 on Monday, as investors cautiously awaited inflation data in Brazil and the US, as well as the start of the second quarter earnings season later this week. Meanwhile, the release of softer-than-expected consumer and producer price data from China has rekindled concerns about slowing global growth. On the domestic front, the latest "Focus survey" revealed 2023 inflation forecasts were cut for the eighth consecutive week to 4.95% from 4.98% a week before; while the GDP growth projection remained unchanged at 2.19%. Among single stocks, the biggest losses were posted by Lojas Renner (-6.3%), VIA (-4.2%), Magazine Luiza (-4.1%). </td>

y/y CPI change will look low tomorrow, due to the base effect. It&amp;#39;s baked into expectations. But it&amp;#39;s the last month in which y/y has the base effect working working in its favor. That means NEXT month may very well show inflation re-accelerating. 
 
So, I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure what the market wants/needs to see tomorrow. Guessing that it&amp;#39;s more complicated than &amp;quot;beating expectations.&amp;quot; Any theories? </td>

A blistering rally in growth and technology stocks has lifted the Nasdaq 100 index by 37.5% this year. That compares with a 14.8% gain for the benchmark S&amp;amp;P 500. 
 
$MSFT $AAPL $AMZN and $TSLA combined account for 43.8% weight in the index, according to Refinitiv data as of Monday&amp;#39;s close. As part of the rebalance that will come down to 38.5%. </td>

This was the 6th consecutive quarter of contraction brought on by macroeconomic headwinds, weak demand from both the consumer and commercial sectors, and a shift in IT budgets away from device purchases. 
 
The overall weak demand has caused inventory levels to remain above normal for longer than expected. This includes finished systems at the channel level, as well as the supply chain.  
 
$AAPL benefited from a favorable on-year comparison as the company suffered supply issues during the second quarter of 2022 due to COVID-related shutdowns within the supply chain.

TikTok Music works pretty much the same way as other music streaming services. But to make the platform appealing, especially among teens, TikTok Music provides song recommendations and personalized curation to help users find songs that have gone viral on TikTok videos. There are options to create collaborative playlists, import music library from other platforms, and find a song by searching for lyrics. There’s even a song identification feature that works similarly to Apple’s Shazam. TikTok Music also lets users interact with social features, which includes comments on songs &amp;amp; albums. 
 
For now, TikTok Music is only available in Brazil &amp;amp; Indonesia.
