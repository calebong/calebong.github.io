   <td style="text-align:left;"> Support of Taiwan independence could spark US military conflict with China, Chinese ambassador says - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> (CNN)China and the United States could end up in a military conflict if the United States encourages Taiwan's independence, Beijing's ambassador to Washington said in a US radio interview broadcast on Friday.                                    , China considers the neighboring, democratically ruled island of Taiwan its "sacred" territory and has never renounced the use of force to ensure eventual unification.                                                                               , "Let me emphasize this. The Taiwan issue is the biggest tinder-box between China and the United States," Qin Gang told National Public Radio.                                                                                                        , "If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely (will) involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in a military conflict," he said.                       , Asked to comment, the US Defense Department said the United States remained committed to its "one China" policy and its commitments under the US Taiwan Relations Act.                                                                               , Under the long-standing policy, Washington officially recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei, while the act requires the United States to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.                                                             , "We will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability while also maintaining our own capacity to resist any use of force that would jeopardize the security of the people of Taiwan," a Pentagon spokesperson said. , The US State Department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Qin's remark, which came just hours after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi discussed the crisis over Ukraine., While Chinese officials have warned of military action over Taiwan, it is unusual for them to link it directly to the United States.                                                                                                                 , Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have escalated in recent months as China's military has conducted repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait, the waterway separating the island from China.                                                   , US President Joe Biden has said that the United States was not encouraging independence for Taiwan, but he caused a stir in October when he said it would come to the island's defense if China attacked.                                            , The latter remark appeared to depart from Washington's long-held policy of "strategic ambiguity" -- not making clear how the United States would respond -- though the White House quickly said Biden was not signaling a change in policy.          , The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, told Congress last year China wants the ability to invade and hold Taiwan within the next six years but might not intend to do so in the near term.                               , </td>

The two veterans, Ronald Sloan and William Wayman, were each awarded $15 million in compensatory damages and $40 million in punitive damages by a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida., Bryan F. Aylstock, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said both men had tinnitus and hearing loss that interfered with their daily lives.                                                                                                                                                                                               , “While they are certainly pleased with the verdict and happy that the jury saw through the defenses that 3M tried to put forth, they have to go back to their lives living with these permanent conditions that simply will never go away and will only get worse,” Mr. Aylstock said.                                            , Mr. Sloan and Mr. Wayman both used the earplugs during training and their deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to their lawyers. Mr. Sloan served in the Army from 1994 to 2015, and Mr. Wayman served from 1997 to 2017.                                                                                               , Mr. Aylstock said 3M needlessly put soldiers in harm’s way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “It’s not as though this was a paper clip or a Post-it note, where if it doesn’t work, it’s not a huge deal,” Mr. Aylstock said. “They knew this was going to cause permanent damage to our soldiers.”                                                                                                                            , 3M said in an emailed statement that it would appeal the jury’s decision and noted that the company had won the previous two cases in the earplugs litigation.                                                                                                                                                                    , “While we are disappointed with the verdicts, the overall mixed record in the bellwether process thus far shows that plaintiffs face significant challenges in this litigation and each case must be considered on its own facts and circumstances,” the statement said.                                                          , Aearo Technologies, a subsidiary of 3M, developed the product and was also a defendant in the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Nearly 300,000 service members and civilians are involved with the earplug litigation, which is one of the largest mass torts in U.S. history.                                                                                                                                                                                    , In the 10 other cases that have been decided, 3M won five cases and the plaintiffs won five cases. Nine of the 14 service members who were plaintiffs in the successful lawsuits were awarded $1.7 million to $22.5 million each.                                                                                                 , Five other trial dates are set for this year. The next trial is scheduled to take place in Pensacola, Fla., in March.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , The litigation was spurred in part by a whistle-blower lawsuit that alleged that 3M sold defective earplugs to the military in violation of the False Claims Act. In 2018, 3M agreed to pay $9.1 million in a settlement with the Department of Justice in response to the lawsuit. The settlement did not determine liability.   , Advertisement </td>

The PCE Price Index gauge may be most important metric, generally speaking, but the central bank weighs economic data like unemployment rate and labor force participation, too.                                                                 , "They are looking at as much data as they can absorb to get the best sense of the dynamics of the economy," Goldwein said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , High and lingering inflation is the result of supply-and-demand dynamics resulting from the pandemic, economists said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , For one, there's been a surge in consumer demand, especially for physical goods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Americans have had a pent-up willingness and ability to spend as they emerge from hibernations at home; government programs like stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and a student-loan pause also put more cash in their wallets, while interest rates near zero offered cheap access to mortgages and other loans, Goldwein said., "We've done all these things juicing demand," Goldwein said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , A shift toward more physical goods has also run headlong into supply-chain issues, as manufacturers have grappled with virus-related closures — limiting supply at the same time demand is increasing, Bivens said.                                                                                                                            , Some economists expect inflation to cool throughout 2022, despite any new Fed policies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Fed officials expect the PCE Price Index to temper, to 2.5% to 3%, by the end of the year, they estimated in December.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued subpoenas to 14 individuals who were purported "alternate electors" for former President Donald Trump. "The Select Committee is seeking information about attempts in multiple states to overturn the results of the 2020 election, including the planning and coordination of efforts to send false slates of electors to the National Archives," said Rep.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Boot Barn Holdings Inc. 
        BOOT,
        -9.72%
       stock sank 9.4% in Friday trading as at least two analyst groups cut their price targets and concerns rise about the road ahead for the Western-style retailer. Late Thursday, Boot Barn reported fiscal third-quarter net income totaling $69.2 million, or $2.27 per share, up from $29.6 million, or $1.00 per share, the year before. Adjusted EPS of $2.23, beating the FactSet consensus for $2.22. Sales of $485.9 million were up from $302.3 million last year, and also ahead of the FactSet consensus for $483.1 million. "We doubt Boot Barn's 3Q22 earnings eased investors' concerns on how the company will perform in FY23 given looming macro headwinds and tough compares," wrote UBS in a note. "We share this concern. Fiscal stimulus may have boosted FY22 sales more than we realize and inflation could harm Boot Barn's middle-income consumer more than we current expect." UBS held on to its neutral stock rating and cut its price target to $110 from $129. Baird cut its price target to $130 from $145 (stock rated neutral). Cowen, on the other hand, is more optimistic. "We have increased confidence new shoppers will be sticky, and encouragingly may be slightly more productive than legacy shoppers," analysts said. Cowen rates Boot Barn outperform with a $140 price target. Boot Barn stock has rallied 49% over the last year while the S&amp;P 500 index

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The central bank of Colombia raised its benchmark interest rate by 100bps to 4.0% on its January 28th meeting, surprising markets that had forecasted a 75bps increase. It followed a 50bps increase in the previous meeting, marking the 5th consecutive rate hike. To support their decision, policymakers noted that consumer inflation in Colombia closed 2021 at 5.62 percent, the highest reading in nearly five years and far above the central bank’s target of 3 percent. In the meantime, inflation expectations were increased to 4.5 percent (from 4.3 percent) by the end of 2022 and 3.6 percent (from 3.4 percent) by the end of 2023. The bank’s board of directors also noted that Colombia’s economy is expected to have grown by 10 percent in 2021. Looking forward, policymakers stated emphasized that consumer inflation’s progress will be monitored, and opened the door for future rate hikes should inflation expectations continue diverging from the central bank's target. </td>

       subsidiary Con Edison is proposing higher rates in 2023, that would boost overall customer electric bills by 11.2% and gas bills by 18.2%, as the New York-based utility looks to fund clean energy investments. Consolidated Edison's stock rallied 1.5% in afternoon trading. Con ED's proposal comes as it is seeking $1.2 billion in additional revenue to upgrade and operate its electric delivery system, as well as to recover the money already spent to provide service but deferred recovering as certain federal income tax credits expired. Con Ed is looking to fund upgrades to its overhead and underground electricity delivery systems in New York City's five boroughs and Westchester County, to help integrate solar and wind power and ensure the system can handle the growing need to charge electric vehicles.

We're watching these programs closely to see how they impact the rewards category as a whole.", Visa has no plans to hold cryptocurrency on its balance sheet, but it's created a crypto consulting service and made several recent investments in crypto platforms as it continues to push for adoption of digital currencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The Central Bank of Azerbaijan raised its official discount rate by 25 basis points to 7.5% on January 28th 2022, citing an intensification of inflationary pressures in the global economy, namely in prices of food, raw materials, transportation and logistics. The 12-month inflation rate in Azerbaijan climbed to a four-year high of 6.7% in December, moving further away from the upper limit of the central bank target range of 2% to 6%. Governor Rustamov said that annual inflation is expected to be higher than the target range at around 6.6-7.5% in 2022, but it should return to the target in 2023. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The National Bank of Angola kept its benchmark policy rate at 20% during its regular meeting on January 28th 2022. The decision is aimed at continue supporting the domestic recovery in a context of persistent inflationary pressures. The annual inflation rate climbed for the ninth straight month to 27.03% in December of 2021, its highest level since July of 2017. Meanwhile, the economy advanced by 0.8% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021, the first expansion since the last quarter of 2018, following nine consecutive quarters of declines. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index closed marginally lower at 73,455 on Friday, as the prospect of higher interest rates ahead and ongoing Russia-Ukraine tensions weighed on market sentiment. Domestically, the South African Reserve Bank lifted the repo rate by the margin expected to 4% citing inflation risks. The central bank also noted that short-term growth prospects remain fragile. Meanwhile, there are expectations that some restrictions could be lifted soon amid a decline in infections. At the same time, the United Arab Emirates announced that travellers from South Africa and 11 other African nations would be allowed to enter the country from January 29th. This brings an end to a two-month-long travel ban which was imposed shortly after the discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant. For the week, the JSE booked a 1.8% loss, amid the Fed's hawkish stance. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Elon Musk just took the entire EV sector down with these comments - CNN </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New York (CNN Business)Six months ago, Elon Musk said he would stop attending investor conference calls unless there was "something important" that he needed to say. He should have stuck with that plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , After skipping Tesla's third-quarter call, he returned to the call Wednesday to discuss fourth quarter's record earnings and revenue. But his comments on this week's conference call spooked investors despite Tesla's successful financial results. Tesla (TSLA) shares had their worst day in months on Thursday, losing 11.6% and taking the other EV stocks down along with it.                                                                                                                      , Musk focused his comments on supply chain issues that had hurt Tesla far less than other automakers. Although Musk said Tesla was on path to be "comfortably above 50% growth in 2022," and that the chip shortage is "better than last year," he also noted the supply chain problem is "still an issue that could slow the rollout of new vehicles that had been expected as soon as this year.                                                                                                         , He said plans for its Cybertruck, Tesla's first pickup, would be pushed back to at least 2023, along with a new Roadster and a semi truck. He said he hopes Tesla will be "ready to bring those to production hopefully next year. That is most likely."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , That wasn't what Tesla investors wanted to hear -- especially as competition heats up: Upstart EV truck maker Rivian is already building and selling its electric pickup, which recently won Motor Trend Truck of the Year honors. Ford (F) is due to start building its F-150 Lightning EV in the spring and plans to produce 80,000 trucks a year to meet strong pre-orders. General Motors (GM) this week announced it would start building an EV version of its Silverado and Sierra pickups in 2024. , Some Wall Street analysts were frustrated by Musk's comments on the call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , "There was no reason that he needed to double down and shout 'supply chain' into a crowded theater," said Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities. "He gave the bears meat on the bones. That's why the stock sold off. I'm convinced if Musk was not on the call, the stock probably would have been up on Thursday."                                                                                                                                                                               , None of Musk's comments directly addressed the situation at other EV companies. But all the pure-play EV stocks fell sharply Thursday. Rivian fell 10.5% while Lucid shares tumbled 14.1%, and Chinese EV maker Nio (NIO) had its US shares fall 6.8%. Ives said Musk's comments raised concerns that if an EV maker as big as Tesla is facing problems, its smaller upstart rivals could be suffering even worse.                                                                                        , Tesla shares are down 21% this year through Thursday's close, and it has fallen below a $1 trillion market cap -- a benchmark it hit late last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Even with the sell-off, which continued Friday, Tesla shares are worth more than the market value of the 10 largest automakers in the world, combined. That means Tesla has a valuation that many people think is unsustainable, making it more susceptible to sell-offs like the one Thursday, especially at a time that broader US markets are already in correction territory.                                                                                                                         , "Investors wanted confidence from Musk," Ives said. "Instead they got him talking about supply chain and robots."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Musk's comments on the call were a stark contrast to Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook's performance on its call Thursday evening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Cook also had very strong fourth quarter results to report, and like just about all manufacturing companies on the planet, is dealing with supply issues. But with Cook assuring investors, Apple shares were higher in Friday morning trading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Osaka rubber futures traded around 226 yen per kg level, after hitting a three-week low of 223 on January 27th, amid a weaker yen and expectations of greater demand from China ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays. Still, concerns persist that global monetary policy tightening will slow growth and fears that continued bottlenecks in global supply chains due to the spreading pandemic will hinder car production recovery. Toyota Motor Corp is slowing production at as many as 11 plants in Japan because of rising COVID-19 infections among its workers and those at parts suppliers. There are also fears that supply may get tight as coronavirus curbs by rubber-producing countries in Southeast Asia would cause labor shortages at rubber farms. </td>

Energy and industrial stocks took the most losses, led by Saipem (-5.1%) and Cnh Industrial (-3.3%). Stellantis lost 2.7% after Chinese automaker GAC scolded the French/Italian group for increasing their stake in the GAC-Stellantis joint venture without prior approval. At the same time, UniCredit dropped 0.2%, slightly outperforming the financial sector, after posting corporate results that beat market forecasts and confirming the bank is no longer pursuing the acquisition of Otkritie Bank due to geopolitical tensions in Russia. On the political front, Italian lawmakers will once resume voting in the sixth round of elections, after blank ballots dominated previous voting rounds as parties failed to compromise on candidates. </td>

Most sectors ended lower, with miners leading the rout with a 3.3% drop, while retailers ended higher following upbeat results from LVMH and H&amp;M. The French luxury goods maker gained 3.7% as Q4 sales growth accelerated, while Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M jumped 5.1% and posted a bigger profit rise than expected for the September-November period. In addition, Italy's UniCredit reported better-than-expected full-year revenue and underlying profit. On a brighter note, GDP data from France, Spain and Sweden came in better-than-forecast. For the week, both the DAX and the Stoxx 600 fell 1.8%, the fourth straight weekly loss for the pan-European index. </td>

Meanwhile, South Africa’s Reserve Bank lifted its repo rate for a 2nd straight meeting to 4%, its highest in two years, saying a gradual rise in interest rates will anchor inflation expectations and moderate the future path of interest rates. Meanwhile, the central bank cut its economic growth forecast for 2021 to 4.8%, from an earlier estimate of 5.2%, amid the impact of July unrest, strikes and travel restrictions imposed by several countries after the discovery of the Omicron variant in December. The economy is seen decelerating to 1.7% and 1.8% in 2022 and 2033, as a result of the fading rebound from the pandemic. Also, uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic and domestic constraints from load shedding to lack of progress in economic reforms continue to threaten the country's recovery. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Nobel laureate Paul Krugman says crypto has ‘disturbing’ parallels with subprime mortgage meltdown </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> , Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has given an ominous warning about the volatile cryptocurrency market, comparing it to the subprime mortgage crisis of the late 2000s.                                                                                                                                            , In an opinion piece for The New York Times on Thursday, Krugman said he's "seeing uncomfortable parallels" between crypto and the U.S. subprime crash, which brought the whole housing market to its knees and triggered the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.                                                              , "There are disturbing echoes of the subprime crash 15 years ago," Krugman says in the piece.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , The subprime crisis was essentially the result of banks making loans out to people of higher risk, at a time when interest rates were low and house prices were soaring. Once the market became saturated, homeowners found themselves in negative equity unable to repay their loans, resulting in hefty losses for lenders., Krugman argues crypto investors are similarly being sold speculative financial products without truly understanding the risks involved. It's worth noting Krugman is a known bitcoin bear, having previously likened the cryptocurrency to a Ponzi scheme.                                                                   , "Many borrowers didn't understand what they were getting into," he said in the NYT op-ed. "And cryptocurrencies, with their huge price fluctuations seemingly unrelated to fundamentals, are about as risky as an asset class can get."                                                                                      , The Nobel laureate isn't convinced cryptocurrencies pose a systemic risk, however: "The numbers aren't big enough to do that." The entire crypto market is worth roughly $1.7 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.                                                                                                         , Bitcoin and other digital currencies have dropped sharply in recent weeks. At a price of just over $37,000, the world's top coin is currently around 46% off its November record high of nearly $69,000. At the peak, the whole crypto market was worth a combined $3 trillion.                                              , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The University of Michigan consumer sentiment for the US was revised lower to 67.2 in January of 2022, the lowest level since November 2011, compared to a preliminary of 68.8. Both current conditions (72 vs preliminary of 73.2) and expectations (64.1 vs 65.9) were revised down. Inflation expectations were confirmed at 4.9% for the year ahead and 3.1% for the next five years. According to Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, "the Delta and Omicron variants were largely responsible, but other factors, some of which were initially triggered by covid, have become independent forces shaping sentiment. Overall confidence in government economic policies is at its lowest level since 2014. Although their primary concern is rising inflation and falling real incomes, consumers may misinterpret the Fed's policy moves to slow the economy as part of the problem rather than part of the solution". </td>

Now, some of that money is going away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , The gush of funds has helped alleviate the suffering inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic and propelled the global economy. But powerful growth — the U.S. economy expanded at a 6.9 percent annualized pace in the last three months of 2021 — has been accompanied by sizzling inflation. Consumers and investors experienced increases in the prices of millions of items and services, ranging from houses, apartment rents and gasoline to the stocks in their portfolios.                                                                                               , As government aid programs wind down, some of the fiscal stimulus has already begun to ebb. And on Wednesday the Federal Reserve said it planned to reverse the monetary stimulus under its control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , These changes have enormous implications for financial markets, which haven’t been handling the news especially well so far. While Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, told reporters about the bank’s intentions on Wednesday afternoon, stocks plummeted, continuing a decline that began on Jan. 3 amid a spreading presumption that Fed policy was shifting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , The Fed is, in a sense, the central bank for the world, and when it changes course, the stakes are high for the entire planet. How far the Fed will go, and what will happen to inflation, economic growth and employment, are crucial questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Inflation is driving the Fed’s shift. The Consumer Price Index in December rose at a 7 percent annual rate, the fastest pace in 40 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , How much of this inflation has been caused by government and central bank stimulus policies and how much by bottlenecks and behavioral changes set off by the pandemic is the subject of a vigorous debate. The Fed had sided with the camp that said the problem was mainly “transitory” and would ease when the pandemic did. But both the pandemic and inflation have been stubbornly persistent, as Mr. Powell acknowledged on Wednesday. Rising prices are causing hardships for people living paycheck to paycheck, he said, and eroding the wealth of many investors.   , To combat inflation, the Fed plans to start by raising the Fed funds rate, its benchmark short-term interest rate, which it has held near zero since March 2020. It’s likely to start in March. How high that rate will go, and how quickly, isn’t clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The Fed lowered rates to the “zero bound” for the first time during the financial crisis of 2008. It was part of a great experiment, an effort to rescue the shaken financial system and the sinking economy when Ben S. Bernanke was chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , But the experiment never really ended. Because the economy remained weak, the Fed didn’t begin raising rates until December 2015, and it never got far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , By 2019, when Mr. Powell was chair, the Fed funds rate had reached only 2.50 percent before signs of economic weakness made the Fed stop. In March 2020, it fell back to nearly zero. By contrast, the Fed funds rate was as high as 6.60 percent as recently as July 2000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , So there is reason for skepticism about how far the Fed will be able to go this time. Rising interest rates tend to reduce economic activity, which, in turn, tends to reduce the rate of inflation. Interest on car loans and some credit card loans will rise along with short-term rates, for example. That can be expected to cut demand for cars and, perhaps, thwart further big price increases.                                                                                                                                                                        , But if the economy weakens too much, the Fed might reverse itself once more. Yet if inflation keeps rising, the central bank could be forced into far harsher measures than it now contemplates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , After the Fed starts to raise rates, Mr. Powell said, it will use another tool: paring the bonds and other securities on its huge balance sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , The assets owned by the Fed swelled in another grand experiment of 2008, known as quantitative easing, in which the Fed began buying bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Those purchases had the effect of lowering interest rates in the bond market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , A broad range of investments by families, private businesses and giant corporations are tied to those rates. And low bond market rates helped to make stocks comparatively attractive and to set off a bull market, which is threatened now by the Fed’s imminent policy reversal: quantitative tightening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The amounts involved in the Fed’s quantitative easing have been staggering. Back in 2008, the Fed’s balance sheet had assets of $820 billion. They reached $4.5 trillion — yes, trillion — in 2015 and dropped only as low as $3.76 trillion in the summer of 2019. With the coronavirus financial crisis, they have ballooned again, to $8.9 trillion, and may swell a bit more before the spigot shuts. Assets held by the Fed are already more than 10 times their size in 2008, and bigger, as a proportion of gross domestic product, than at any time since World War II., The Fed’s monetary stimulus accompanied a total of roughly $5 trillion in pandemic fiscal relief by the federal government. Governments and central banks around the world engaged in emergency relief spending, too. The global fiscal and monetary stimulus total amounts to $25 trillion, according to Chris Dillon, a global investment specialist with T. Rowe Price, the asset management company based in Baltimore. This year, that flow is being reduced to a comparative trickle.                                                                                    , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Calibrating the combined effects of quantitative tightening and interest rate increases in real time is exceedingly difficult. Cut off stimulus too rapidly and the Fed could further unnerve financial markets. It could conceivably cause a spike in unemployment and a sharp slowdown in growth, plunging the United States into a recession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Move too gingerly, on the other hand, and the Fed could allow elevated inflation expectations to become embedded, making high inflation even more damaging. The last time that happened, when Paul A. Volcker was Fed chairman from 1979 until 1987, it took brutally high interest rates, soaring unemployment and two recessions to wring high inflation out of the national psyche.                                                                                                                                                                                         , No wonder Mr. Powell said the Fed would need to proceed with “humility.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , The Fed’s task is fraught with risk, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. The bottlenecks in the economy could clear up if the coronavirus ebbs, which could solve part of the inflation problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Through control of the Fed funds rate and its ability to adjust the pace and type of securities it sells when it reduces its balance sheet, the Fed can affect a broad spectrum of interest rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Even if the Fed manages to avoid a recession that throws a lot of people out of work, the path ahead is unlikely to be smooth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , For investors, high-quality bonds should help to buffer volatility, and big losses, in stocks. And you could try adjusting your stock holdings. In this environment, for example, T. Rowe Price suggests emphasizing value stocks like AIG, Bank of America and General Electric over growth stocks like Microsoft, Amazon, Visa and Nvidia, and investing globally, especially in emerging markets. Whether those moves will really help, I can’t say.                                                                                                                        , Fixed-income investors might want to tilt some holdings toward securities of shorter duration, Ms. Jones said. That’s because as interest rates rise, bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, can fall enough to lead to losses, especially for long-term securities. Still, over several years, as bonds are reinvested at higher rates, returns will increase in many bond funds, offsetting short-term losses.                                                                                                                                                   , Doing nothing may be a good option if you can afford to withstand some blows and have a diversified portfolio. I’ve been investing in stock and bond funds for decades and believe I’m sufficiently fortified with cash, in case things become really nasty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , If you aren’t ready, it may make sense to sell off some holdings. It’s always smart to be well prepared, even if trouble never shows up at your door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Madrid Stocks Trade Lower on Friday </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The IBEX 35 Index erased early gains to trade 1.5% lower around the 8,580 on Friday, as investors displayed caution amid prospects of faster monetary policy tightening in a volatile week for equity markets. Banking shares fell 1.7% and energy stocks fell 1.1%, despite higher oil prices. Caixabank traded 1.7% lower after posting net profits of EUR 5.23 billion during 2021, missing market expectations of EUR 5.25 billion, while posting a 52% decline in net recurring profits during the fourth quarter of the year. In the macroeconomic data front, Spain’s economy expanded 2% during the three months leading to December, beating market expectations of a 1.4 percent rise, according to preliminary estimates. At the same time, industrial morale jumped to 6.7, the highest in over two decades. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US 10Y Treasury Note Yield Rebounds </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded around 1.82% on Friday, faltering from earlier levels close to 1.85%, as investors digested a fresh batch of economic data. The employment cost index, cited by Chairman Powell as a key metric, rose 1.0% over the previous quarter in Q4, easing from a 1.3% increase in the prior period and missing market forecasts of 1.2% gain. Meanwhile, inflation-adjusted consumer spending fell 0.6% in December, as expected, reflecting the anticipation of the holiday shopping season to November and pandemic-related supply chain issues. On the other hand, Core PCE prices, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, jumped to a near four-decade high of 4.9% in December, surpassing market expectations of 4.8% and continued its upward trend above the inflation target of 2%. On Wednesday, the Fed signaled a rate hike in March as expected, while suggesting more frequent and larger interest rate increases could happen this year. </td>

Millions of borrowers — many of whom haven’t made loan payments in nearly two years — will once again have to start paying their monthly bill.                                                                                                                                                                         , Student debt repayment programs were a hot topic in 2019, but companies’ interest ebbed in the pandemic, said Craig Copeland, senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, as the pause on federal student debt payments temporarily took pressure off borrowers. Employers shifted their focus to programs offering more immediate help, like emergency savings and hardship payments.                                                                                   , But there are signs of renewed interest among both borrowers and employers as the pause expires and employers seek to hire and hold on to increasingly emboldened workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , The institute’s 2021 survey of employers’ “financial well-being” benefits found that about 17 percent of large employers — those with 500 or more workers — offered some form of student debt assistance. Of those, nearly a third (30 percent) offered direct loan subsidies and an additional 40 percent said they planned to start offering direct help in the next year or two.                                                                                                                  , “I would think adoption would start ticking up as we get to a more normal work environment,” Mr. Copeland said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , In 2019, typical borrowers with any remaining debt from their own education owed $20,000 to $25,000, and the typical required monthly payment was $200 to $300, according to a report from the Federal Reserve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A Fidelity Investments survey in October of about 1,600 employers of varying sizes found that more than a quarter (29 percent) offered a contribution to student debt as a benefit. And more employers are likely to consider it, now that the federal loan payment pause is scheduled to expire.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “It’s creating a sense of urgency right now,” said Jesse Moore, head of student debt at Fidelity, which administers student debt repayment programs for clients and offers a benefit to its own employees. (It recently increased the maximum benefit to $15,000 from $10,000.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , A big factor is that under the federal government’s pandemic relief programs enacted in 2020, employers are able to make tax-exempt loan repayment contributions to their employees of up to $5,250 a year through 2025. Employees don’t have to pay income taxes on the benefit. (Previously, unlike tuition assistance payments for employees enrolled in college, loan-repayment contributions were taxable.)                                                                                     , McLaren Northern Michigan Hospital in Petoskey, Mich., is among the employers that have added a direct assistance benefit. The hospital began offering student loan aid this month, joining two other hospitals in its health system, said Todd Burch, McLaren Northern’s president and chief executive.                                                                                                                                                                                             , It has become especially difficult to keep nurses, Mr. Burch said, because they are increasingly able to work on lucrative mobile assignments as travel nurses. “We’re looking for unique offerings to recruit and retain top talent,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , The benefit is available to all employees after they have worked at the hospital for six months and pays $200 a month in the first year, $300 monthly in the second year and $400 monthly in the third year, with a maximum benefit of $12,000. (Benefits are prorated for part-time workers.) Already, 91 employees have applied for the benefit.                                                                                                                                                   , McLaren works with Goodly, a start-up that manages student loan payment benefits for companies. Workers submit their loan information to Goodly, which verifies the worker’s eligibility and transmits payments from the employer to the lender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Esker, a software company with U.S. headquarters in Wisconsin, began offering the benefit in 2019. The company generally hires workers directly from college, so education loans are often a concern, said Anne Donarski, the company’s director of finance and administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , “We know student debt is becoming an increasing burden,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , Employees are eligible from their first day on the job, but the contribution increases with their tenure at the company — from $100 a month to start, up to $150 a month, payable over five years. The company has about 200 employees, and 55 use the benefit. Esker has so far paid about $186,000 in loan help, Ms. Donarski said.                                                                                                                                                                , Here are some questions and answers about student loan repayment benefits:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Details vary by employer, so it’s best to ask, if you’re considering joining a company because of its student debt benefits. For a student loan to be repaid by an employer tax-free, it must be borrowed in the employee’s name and used for the employee’s education, said Greg Poulin, co-founder and chief executive of Goodly. (Some employers may choose to repay loans held by a worker’s spouse or child, he said, but the income then becomes taxable.)                                     , In general, both federally held loans and those borrowed from a private lender are eligible for the benefit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Direct payment “is the richest benefit,” said Mr. Moore at Fidelity. But some companies may offer alternatives, like payments tied to the company’s 401(k) retirement plan. Workers make student loan payments themselves and then the company deposits a corresponding “match” into the employee’s 401(k) account. (Legislation pending in Congress aims to make it easier for employers to offer this option.) Another option that companies may offer includes help with refinancing student debt., But make sure you understand the details of any plan before you enroll. Refinancing federal student loans, for instance, means giving up borrower protections that aren’t available with private loans. “Borrowers should be careful about what they’re getting,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center.                                                                                                                                                    , The complete cancellation of federal student loans is unlikely. President Biden has voiced support in the past for canceling $10,000 of student debt per borrower, while Democrats like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, are pressuring the president to cancel $50,000 per borrower, by executive action if necessary.                                                                                                                                             , Sandy Baum, a nonresident senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s Center on Education Data and Policy, said in an email that she suspected that the administration might target forgiveness to specific groups of borrowers, like those who were victims of fraud and abuse. But blanket forgiveness, whether by executive action or by legislation, “seems unlikely,” she said.                                                                                                                      , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> US Futures Waver, Volatility Set to Continue </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> US futures swung and volatility is set to continue when markets open as investors digest fresh economic data and mixed earnings reports. Monthly PCE inflation came in line with forecasts and personal spending and income moderated in December, temporarily easing some concerns of a tighter monetary policy from the Fed. On the corporate front, shares of Chevron lost in premarket trading after earnings disappointed. Stocks of Caterpillar were also in the red even after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Meanwhile, Apple shares surged almost 5% in premarket trading after the company report record revenues and profits that beat forecasts and said it expects supply constraints in the March quarter to be less than they were in the December quarter. So far on the week, the Dow Jones is down 0.3% which would mark a 4th weekly decline. The S&amp;P 500 lost more than 1.5%, also a 4th weekly fall and the Nasdaq fell 1.4%, a 5th week of declines. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> WTI crude futures jumped around 2% to above $88 a barrel on Friday, holding at levels not seen since 2014 and are on track for a sixth straight week of gains, amid tight supply and prospects of strong demand. Worries over supply disruptions due to geopolitical risks in Ukraine also helped to support the oil market. Meanwhile, the OPEC+ meeting next week will be in the spotlight. The group is expected to ratify another modest production increase of 400,000 bpd in March although the cartel has been struggling to accomplish with the output rise. On the demand side, China’s crude oil imports could rebound by 6-7% this year as buyers step up purchases for new refining units and to replenish low inventories, according to a Reuters report. </td>

Within compensation, the increase reflected gains in both private and government wages and salaries, while within proprietors' income, both nonfarm and farm income decreased.

At the same time, consumer spending fell in December as spiraling coronavirus caseloads kept many Americans at home and persistent supply chain bottlenecks disrupted holiday shopping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           , Those indicators, released on Friday, underline that despite plummeting unemployment and a strong rebound in growth, the economy — like the country itself — has yet to break free of the pandemic’s grip. That is making for a confusing and contradictory moment headed into 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Rising prices and an unflagging pandemic are slowing spending, denting consumer optimism and detracting from quickly climbing pay and unusually rapid overall growth. People are predicting worse financial outcomes for themselves and higher inflation as the virus lingers and uncertainty deepens, bad news for policymakers who are just beginning to try to tame price increases.                                                                                                          , The Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose 5.8 percent in the year ending in December, up from 5.7 percent the prior month. Prices are climbing at the fastest pace since 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Even as inflation moderates somewhat on a monthly basis, it remains unusually fast, and pay is picking up briskly. Robust wage growth can be good news for workers, but it also increases the risk of sustained high inflation: Companies may raise prices to try to cover rising labor costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The Employment Cost Index, a measure of pay and benefits that the Fed watches closely, climbed by slightly less in the final quarter of 2021 than economists had predicted but capped a year in which workers won big wage increases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , Overall compensation climbed 4 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year, the data showed, and wages and salaries picked up 4.5 percent. Both were the fastest pace of increase since the data series started two decades ago — though they failed to keep up with inflation on average.                                                                                                                                                                                        , Source: Employment Cost Index, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , By The New York Times                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “Overall wage growth, on a nominal basis, is still pretty strong,” said Omair Sharif, the founder of Inflation Insights, referring to the wage growth that has not been adjusted for price increases. “The downside is that inflation is eating away at all of these nominal gains.”                                                                                                                                                                                                             , As price gains chip away at consumers’ earnings, they also are eroding voter sentiment, making inflation a political liability for the Biden administration and Democrats during a midterm election year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , President Biden and his advisers have been trying to emphasize the positives, arguing that, despite inflation, the economy overall has experienced a historically strong rebound over the past year. Unemployment has fallen and wages have been rising, particularly for the lowest-paid workers. On Thursday, the Commerce Department said the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product, grew 5.7 percent in 2021, the biggest gain since 1984.                                 , But the data released Friday complicated that narrative. Consumer spending fell 0.6 percent in December, the first decrease since February. Forecasters expect further declines in early 2022 as the Omicron wave of the coronavirus keeps workers at home and further disrupts supply chains.                                                                                                                                                                                                   , And while pay is still climbing quickly for low-wage workers, those gains are no longer keeping up with inflation. Wages and salaries for leisure and hospitality workers rose 1.6 percent in the final three months of the year, less than the increase in prices over the same period as measured by either major inflation index.                                                                                                                                                             , Prices began to rise last year as global supply lines struggled to keep pace with demand for couches, cars and other goods. Officials had hoped those pressures would fade fast, but instead inflation has lingered and broadened into categories that are especially salient to consumers, like food and rent.                                                                                                                                                                                  , The White House has taken steps aimed at relieving pressure on choked supply chains to try to bring inflation down around the edges, but the job of slowing demand to bring prices under control rests primarily with the Fed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , The Fed’s policymakers have signaled that they likely will begin to raise interest rates at their March meeting as they try to prevent today’s quick price increases from becoming a more permanent feature of the economic landscape. Economists expect several rate increases this year, but how many is uncertain — J.P. Morgan now expects five, while Krishna Guha at Evercore ISI wrote in a note on Friday that it is plausible the Fed could hike anywhere between three and seven times., Markets are nervously eyeing the Fed’s next steps, with stocks falling in the first three weeks of the year as investors tried to gauge how fast it will move. Higher borrowing costs could slow down economic growth and lower stock prices, taking some of the buoyancy out of the recovery. But the S&amp;P 500 rallied on Friday after the latest reports, jumping 2.4 percent and avoiding a fourth consecutive weekly loss.                                                                    , Economists do expect inflation to fade this year, and Fed officials have projected that it will ease to less than 3 percent by the end of 2022. But they are watching for signs that it might instead linger, especially at a time when the world’s trade system remains under pronounced stress and it is unclear whether consumer spending is decelerating or hitting a pandemic-induced bump before roaring back.                                                                             , “We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity could put upward pressure on inflation,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s chair, said during a news conference on Wednesday. Friday’s data could offer officials some slight reprieve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , In December, Mr. Powell specifically cited the previous Employment Cost Index reading — which showed big wage increases in the third quarter — as one reason the Fed had decided to shift from stoking growth to preparing to fight inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                                                         , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , The fact that the measure did not pick up as sharply as expected in the final quarter of the year could give investors some confidence that the central bank’s policy-setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee, will not further speed up its plans to withdraw economic help.                                                                                                                                                                                                           , “With labor participation creeping higher and measures of excess demand flattening in recent months, it is reasonable to think that wage growth is unlikely to reaccelerate dramatically,” Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote following the release. “In the meantime, this report eases the immediate pressure on the F.O.M.C. to act aggressively.”                                                                                                        , The data released on Friday contained some other encouraging signs. Consumer spending on services rose, including in categories like travel and movies that were badly bruised by the pandemic, while goods spending fell, suggesting that spending patterns continued to normalize after two years of disruptions. That should ease pressure on supply chains over time.                                                                                                                        , And while Omicron’s impact was clear in the overall spending numbers, there is little evidence the latest wave of cases has done more lasting damage to the economy, at least so far. Personal income rose 0.3 percent in December, led by an 0.7 percent increase in wage and salary income.                                                                                                                                                                                                    , But households show little sign of optimism. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey has been faltering for months as prices have risen, and the index nose-dived in January to its lowest level since late 2011, when the economy was slogging back from the global financial crisis, according to data released on Friday.                                                                                                                                                        , The Conference Board’s index of confidence also ticked down this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , “You have very high inflation, so people are seeing an erosion of their purchasing power,” said Dana M. Peterson, the chief economist at The Conference Board, noting that the resurgent virus is also to blame. “People will have higher confidence once we’re beyond Omicron.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , For now, economic uncertainty is dominating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     , Ashley Fahr, the owner of La Cuisine, a culinary company and event space in Venice, Calif., said rising grocery costs began to bite at a difficult moment — just before Omicron surged, causing people to pull back from activities like the cooking classes and catering events she offers.                                                                                                                                                                                                     , She noticed in December that her food bill had gone up by about 15 percent, chipping away at her margins, and she passed about 5 percent of that on to customers while absorbing the rest of the increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , “I didn’t want to quote a number people would balk at,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Ms. Fahr said that she pays her workers — most of whom are independent contractors — competitive wages and that it’s hard to keep up with rising prices and still turn a profit. She is watching to see what other local caterers and cooking classes do with their pricing, and whether they begin to pass on the full increase to customers.                                                                                                                                                   , “If everyone else does it, I’ll do it too,” Ms. Fahr said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , That sort of logic is what economic officials worry about. If businesses and consumers begin to expect prices to rise steadily, they may begin to plan for those increases instead of resisting them. When inflation gets baked into expectations, it might spiral upward year after year, economists worry.                                                                                                                                                                                     , The University of Michigan’s inflation expectations measure showed that five-year projections climbed to 3.1 percent, the highest since 2009. Fed officials have a history of watching that number along with market-based expectations, which have been slowly nudging higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , “What we’re trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent,” Mr. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his news conference this week. “That’s always the ultimate goal.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , Advertisement </td>

But some analysts cautioned against reading too much into a single day’s bounce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , By Coral Murphy Marcos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , Data delayed at least 15 minutes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Source: FactSet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , By: Ella Koeze                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        , Wall Street finally found a foothold on Friday, rebounding from days of back-to-back declines with its biggest gain in 18 months as investors grabbed on to glimmers of good news: a strong earnings report from Apple and data on wage growth that came in lower than expected.                                                                                                                                                                                      , The S&amp;P 500 rose 2.4 percent, its biggest one-day jump since June 2020, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 3.1 percent. Friday’s gain snapped a three-day streak of losses and left the S&amp;P 500 up 0.8 percent for the week, its first weekly gain this year.                                                                                                                                                                                           , The rally came relatively late in the day and was a remarkable shift in tone after stocks had fallen in early trading and struggled to hold onto gains in the afternoon. Stocks zigzagged between gains and losses every day this week as investors tried to assess how quickly the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates to combat inflation.                                                                                                            , Economists are virtually certain that the central bank will start increasing interest rates in March, but the question now is by how much and how often will it do so. As the answer shifted this week, so did Wall Street’s outlook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 , On that front, some data released on Friday was seen positively. The Employment Cost Index, a measure of wages and salaries in the United States that is closely watched by the Fed, rose 1 percent in the three months ending in December compared with the prior quarter, the government said. That was a slowdown from the previous three months and lower than the rate economists had expected, factors that might take pressure off the Fed, some analysts said., The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, a proxy for investor expectations about rates, dipped slightly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  , Apple also gave markets a big lift after reporting a record profit of $34.6 billion in the last three months of 2021 on Thursday. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said he expected supply chain constraints in the current quarter to be less of a problem than they were during the holidays.                                                                                                                                                                     , Apple’s better-than-expected quarter could ease fears that the tech industry’s long period of fast growth may be coming to an end, and shares of some other big technology stocks — which led the stock market sell-off this month — also climbed. Alphabet rose 3.4 percent, while Meta rose 2.4 percent, and Amazon climbed 3.1 percent.                                                                                                                            , The tech giants are so large that gains in their shares can help pull the broad benchmarks higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , “Apple being able to handle these supply chain problems is very positive,” said Edward Moya, a market analyst at OANDA, a foreign currency exchange and brokerage firm. “You’re going to see that passed on to several other companies.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , Separately, Visa rallied 10.6 percent and was the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 after it reported that payment volumes jumped 20 percent in the final three months of the year. Mastercard, which also reported a jump in spending, climbed 9.1 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                       , That’s not to say that Wall Street’s biggest concerns have suddenly evaporated. Companies are forecasting further headwinds coming in 2022 as wages rise and as supply chain bottlenecks persist, and the combination of these elements has raised fears of a drop in economic growth, corporate profits and the longer-term appetite for stocks.                                                                                                                     , The S&amp;P 500 is still down 7 percent for January, its worst monthly showing since the since the coronavirus pandemic stalled the world’s economies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Investors were spooked early in January by a big jump in government bond yields and then were disappointed by corporate earnings reports or forecasts for the year from companies as varied as Goldman Sachs and Netflix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , On Thursday, for example, shares of the electric vehicle maker Tesla slid more than 11 percent, weighing on the broader S&amp;P 500, after the company said supply chain problems would put a constraint on production in the coming year. Tesla rebounded 2.1 percent on Friday, but is still down 20 percent for the month.                                                                                                                                             , And there was some worrisome economic news on Friday. The University of Michigan reported that its index measuring consumer sentiment fell in January to its lowest level since November 2011. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant, persistent inflation and the increased market volatility were some of the reasons consumers were less upbeat about the economy, the university said.                                                                          , What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.                                                                                                                                                                            , What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , Where is inflation headed? Officials say they do not yet see evidence that rapid inflation is turning into a permanent feature of the economic landscape, even as prices rise very quickly. There are plenty of reasons to believe that the inflationary burst will fade, but some concerning signs suggest it may last.                                                                                                                                              , Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              , How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , But Wall Street’s main concern all month long has been the Fed, which is expected to raise interest rates several times this year as it looks to cool down rising consumer prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , On Friday, the Labor Department said that the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, rose 5.8 percent in the year through December, the fastest jump since 1982.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          , The concern on Wall Street is that interest rates will climb too quickly, hurting corporate profits, hindering consumer demand and discouraging investments in stocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                , “With inflation sky high and the Fed potentially looking to hike rates four times across the year, if not more, the markets fear that the U.S. economy will struggle to absorb such an aggressive approach from the U.S. central bank,” said Fiona Cincotta, a markets analyst at Forex.com.                                                                                                                                                                          , This worry has been most obvious in shares of technology companies, and even after Friday’s rally the Nasdaq composite, is down 12 percent in January — on track for its biggest drop since October 2008.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             , Though the broader S&amp;P 500 has fared better, in large part because a rally in oil prices has lifted shares of energy companies, it remains close to a critical threshold: a drop of 10 percent from its last record, which on Wall Street is called a correction. A drop of that size is considered a marker of investors’ swiftly changing attitudes about prospects for the economy.                                                                                , “A correction signifies that the economy has really lost momentum,” said Mr. Moya. After Friday’s rally, the S&amp;P 500 was down 7.6 percent from its Jan. 3 high. The Nasdaq composite is already in a correction, however, and is down 14 percent from its record, which it reached in November.                                                                                                                                                                       , So, some analysts cautioned against reading too much into Friday’s bounce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            , “Markets were up today, driven by corporate earnings and perhaps some bargain hunting,” said Greg McBride, the chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. “But one in a row is not a streak, and it could be different on Monday.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      , Eshe Nelson contributed reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    , Advertisement </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sweden's retail trade tumbled 4.4 percent from a month earlier in December 2021, the largest decline since October 1995, after the country's government imposed tighter restrictions to fight a surge in new infections and the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. Sales in durables decreased by 6.7 percent and those in consumables, excluding state-owned alcohol monopoly Systembolaget's sales, fell by 1.4 percent. On a yearly basis, retail trade growth slowed sharply to 3.3 percent from 6.1 percent. </td>

The heavy equipment maker's sales were up 23% from a year earlier despite supply chain constraints. However, increased costs weighed on Caterpillar's profit margins and the stock slipped 1.4% in premarket trading., Chevron (CVX) – Chevron slid 2.8% in the premarket after missing bottom-line estimates for the fourth quarter, although revenue exceeded analyst forecasts. Chevron earned an adjusted $2.56 per share, compared with a $3.12 consensus estimate, despite higher oil and gas prices.                                                                                                                       , VF Corp. (VFC) – The company behind North Face, Vans and other apparel brands saw its stock fall 2% in premarket trading after it cut its full-year sales forecast due to delivery delays and worker shortages. VF reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for its most recent quarter.                                                                                                           , Apple (AAPL) – Apple reported record profit and revenue for its latest quarter, despite supply chain issues that cut into sales. Apple earned $2.10 per share, compared with a $1.89 consensus estimate, and revenue also topped Street forecasts. CEO Tim Cook said those supply chain challenges are showing signs of improvement. Apple shares jumped 3.1% in the premarket.                            , Visa (V) – Visa beat estimates by 11 cents with an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.81 per share. The payment network's revenue also beat estimates. Visa was helped by a jump in travel spending and continued growth in e-commerce, with the company seeing quarterly revenue above $7 billion for the first time. Visa rallied 3.6% in premarket trading.                                                , Mondelez (MDLZ) – Mondelez fell a penny short of analyst forecasts with adjusted quarterly earnings of 71 cents per share, though the snack maker's revenue did beat estimates. Mondelez raised prices during the quarter, but it was not enough to make up for increased costs for ingredients and logistics. Mondelez slid 2.2% in premarket action.                                                     , Robinhood (HOOD) – Robinhood slumped 13% in the premarket after warning that current-quarter revenue could fall significantly from a year ago. The trading platform operator reported a quarterly loss of 49 cents per share, 4 cents wider than estimates, although revenue was slightly above analyst forecasts.                                                                                         , Western Digital (WDC) – Western Digital shares plunged 10.4% in premarket trading after the disk drive maker issued a weaker-than-expected outlook, and supply chain issues that prevented it from fully meeting strong demand. Western Digital did beat top and bottom-line estimates for its latest quarter, earning an adjusted $2.30 per share compared with a consensus estimate of $2.13.            , 3M (MMM) – 3M will appeal a ruling that awarded $110 million to two U.S. Army veterans who said they suffered hearing loss after using 3M's combat earplugs. 3M has faced multiple lawsuits over allegations that the design of the earplugs is defective. The stock fell 1% in the premarket.                                                                                                             , Beazer Homes (BZH) – Beazer Homes jumped 5.1% in premarket trading after beating top and bottom-line estimates for the quarter ending in December. Beazer earned $1.14 per share, well above the 67-cent consensus estimate, and said the housing market continues to see strong demand and limited supply                                                                                                 , Got a confidential news tip?

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Seoul, South Korea (CNN)Images have emerged of a US Navy F-35C stealth fighter crashing into the South China Sea earlier this week.                                                                                     , The F-35C, a single-engine stealth fighter and the newest jet in the US Navy fleet, crash-landed on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson during routine operations on Monday, the Navy said.                            , The $100 million warplane impacted the flight deck of the 100,000-ton aircraft carrier and then fell into the water as its pilot ejected, Navy officials said. The pilot and six sailors aboard the Vinson were injured., CNN's Ivan Watson explains US Navy's race to salvage its fighter jet:                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         , A spokesperson for the US Navy's 7th Fleet said Friday that an investigation into the incident is continuing while confirming images that have emerged on social media since the crash are genuine.                     , "The ship has assessed that the video and photo covered by media today were taken onboard USS Carl Vinson ... during the crash," Cmdr. Hayley Sims, public affairs officer for the 7th Fleet said.                      , A still photograph shows the stealth fighter floating on the surface of the South China Sea, its cockpit open and ejection seat missing.                                                                                , A video shows the F-35 on its landing approach to the aircraft carrier but cuts off before the plane impacts the flight deck.                                                                                           , The Navy said earlier this week that the damage to the Vinson was only superficial, and it and the carrier's air wing have resumed normal operations.                                                                   , An effort to recover the fighter jet from the bottom of the South China Sea had begun, said Lt. Nicholas Lingo, another 7th Fleet spokesperson.                                                                         , Analysts said raising the aircraft would likely be a complex operation, and one that would be monitored by China, which claims almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea as its territory.              , The F-35C contains some of the Navy's most advanced technology, and the analysts said Washington would want to keep it out of Beijing's hands.                                                                          , However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday they were aware that a US Navy stealth fighter had crashed in the South China Sea, but "had no interests in their plane."                                        , "We advise [the US] to contribute more to regional peace and stability, rather than flexing force at every turn in [the South China Sea]," China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.                      , CNN's Beijing Bureau contributed to this report. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The FTSE/JSE All Share Index reversed course and was down 0.5% to around 73,150 on Friday afternoon, as the prospect of higher interest rates ahead and ongoing Russia-Ukraine tensions weighed on market sentiment. Domestically, the South African Reserve Bank lifted the repo rate by the margin expected to 4% citing inflation risks. The central bank also noted that short-term growth prospects remain fragile and will likely be affected by continuing power outages and Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Meanwhile, there are expectations that some restrictions could be lifted soon amid a decline in infections. At the same time, the United Arab Emirates announced that travellers from South Africa and 11 other African nations would be allowed to enter the country from January 29th. This brings an end to a two-month-long travel ban which was imposed shortly after the discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY Pay attention to Average Real Wage Growth and party reaction.  Republicans hate it (a mistake IMO) while Democrats have been pushing for a $15 national min. wage since the Democratic Primaries.  (The 2015 Hillary campaign wanted at least $12.)  In 2020 Every Democratic Candidate on stage was in favor of $15 except Yang (who wanted something else.)

Trump on the other hand said; 
“In an interview with Telemundo, Donald Trump said, &amp;quot;Wages have gone up more than 3%….—wages have gone up tremendously in the United States since I&amp;#39;ve taken over. In fact, soon to be record numbers.&amp;quot;”

But, you wouldn’t know it by reading the Republican press.  They’re painting themselves as the “man of the people,” but issue is, we all remember.  We remember the labor unions fighting for better wages, and don’t remember any of the “do-nothing, obstructionist, Conservative Party” being with them.  Just the “wild &amp;amp; crazy Powerless Democrats” were on their side.

As a conservative, I think it’s an issue. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Quick Recap:

- $LCID made some big plays on puts. I told you and tried to show you all $27.02 by today (was still $40ish) and she closed $27.09... Rude Bulls really need to learn to think more and not be so attack ready. Amazing how rude this board was to me the last two weeks.

- $LC added some more and added a few calls. I would not be surprised at all to see a strong rebound here this coming week. I’ve posted on it enough, you can find my thoughts easily. 

- $AMD can’t wait to see what happens at ER. Going to be setting a play up for this very soon! Hopefully we can have some Bull days to get some momentum going!

My team also posted some 2 solid day trades today, and I had a win and miss on $SPY that was a quick hitter. I was out for part of the day so was unable to alert them here. 

Hope everyone had a great week! If you are interested in joining the team, just ask!! Something for everyone!

Be safe. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Here’s why I don’t buy the dip. It’s been over a year since I got into stocks but from my little research &amp;amp; understanding of markets I find the risks significantly outweigh any rewards, why?
• Fed tightening will be the toughest markets to experience since 1983.
• GDP growth significantly slowing. BoA today revised their Q1 GDP growth target from 4% to 1% 
• Mega caps run US markets, they gained av of 300%-500% in last 5yrs, this is not sustainable. 
• Growth stocks have a tough year as borrowing costs go up. Plus they’re heavily shorted, from big names like $SHOP to $FUBO &amp;amp; $SKLZ 
• Geopolitical issues raising, Russia/Ukraine &amp;amp; China/Taiwan. 
I’d rather miss out a little than wipe out the balance in this highly volatile, unpredictable market. GL all

The closing price reversal bottom at 4212.75 seems to have stopped the selling. However, the confirmation of this chart pattern failed to attract enough buyers to sustain the normal 2 to 3 day counter-trend rally. Instead, it stopped at 4446.25.
Taking out 4446.25 will indicate that buyers are slowing regaining control. However, continue to expect several days of two-sided trading as investors try to grind through retracement zone resistance between 4476.25 and 4580.75.
We’re not likely to see an acceleration to the upside until buyers overcome 4580.75 with strong buying volume.
On the downside, aggressive counter-trend buyers could come in on a test of 4266.00 to 4129.00, but if the latter fails as support then we could see another acceleration into multi-month bottoms.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Here’s why I don’t buy the dip. It’s been over a year since I got into stocks but from my little research &amp;amp; understanding of markets I find the risks significantly outweigh any rewards, why?
• Fed tightening will be the toughest markets to experience since 1983.
• GDP growth significantly slowing. BoA today revised their Q1 GDP growth target from 4% to 1% 
• Mega caps run US markets, they gained av of 300%-500% in last 5yrs, this is not sustainable. 
• Growth stocks have a tough year as borrowing costs go up. Plus they’re heavily shorted, from big names like $SHOP to $FUBO &amp;amp; $SKLZ 
• Geopolitical issues raising, Russia/Ukraine &amp;amp; China/Taiwan. 
I’d rather miss out a little than wipe out the balance in this highly volatile, unpredictable market. GL all

What we should do is develop a global virus response team. Whose job it is to find viruses before they become problems and snuff them out. Study them, immediately prepare mass production of protective gear, and begin immediate testing and isolation/lockdowns. That way we snuff them out before they become something we have to deal with for years.

We are God evolving towards ourselves. 

In the beginning (or the state that always was), God was alone. Infinitely powerful even in the simplest form. This is because comparing God (which was all that was at the time) to anything else was impossible. God being all that was was infinite because it was all that was and therefore could only be compared to itself. 

God, being infinitely powerful. Was also infinitely alone and sad. Every time God would create another entity, God would immediately know all possible choices that entity could make in the future. Back to being alone again. Back to being everything. 

God, being intelligent enough. Developed a certain rotation/spin. Capable of encapsulating the prior states while improving into the “future”. Thus losing nothing but gaining everything. 

God was God of everything but also nothing. Only God of itself. God wanted to forget he was alone. So the spin created the illusion of others to evolve oneself. </td>

Cronk said in an interview on CNBC that the market is then set for a counter rally back by possibly 4% to 7%. “Often, you get the real low set in from there, meaning another 10%, 15%,” said Cronk. “That happened in 2020.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $SPY $QQQ Of course this is not the reversal I was expecting. I still think a double bottom at Monday&amp;#39;s low is needed in order to have a sustainable move upside. Today is great, but there is something that bothered me about this rally: The close in the $SPX. It closed 2 points away from 200MA. I really don&amp;#39;t like when it closes few points shy of a resistance; when that happens; usually we reverse course. 
So if $SPX stuggles to clear 4454 Monday, expect it to revisit today&amp;#39;s lows. The way is revisits the low (if it does) will determine if we go down to double bottom or we go up to 4500.  
In resume, 4454 is key. I would hedge at least a little bit here (I am).  
PS1: If I sent you any message, please consider this one as my &amp;quot;official opinion&amp;quot;. I was away this afternoon, so I did not have access to my computer; I was reacting on the heat.  
PS2: If we go down to Monday lows from here, then $SPX is likely to double bottom (or sllightly higher), while the $NDX may make a new low. GL. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Most people that I speak w/ who are in $SPOT dont seem to have any knowledge or understanding of the music Industry, I retired from it after 35 years though I still own a Production company. 
 
No artist over 30 likes Spotify, it wiped out how they made money &amp;amp; its a plague on their livelihoods, They will have no issues watching it fall. I work w/ some of the Top artist &amp;amp; labels in the world &amp;amp; this is a common talking point &amp;amp; has been for years 
 
What happen last week w/ Neil just gave so many other artist the impetus to know they can get their music off &amp;amp; more will.  You may like Rogan but when music leaves $spot &amp;amp; its all Podcast then its AM radio &amp;amp; we know what happened there. 
 
So the technology will change but listening to people applaud what they did are applauding their own demise.

$1k -&amp;gt; $1m options challenge recap 🏄‍♂️

Week 7 

Initial: $1,000
Current: $43,605
Target: $1,000,000 in March
- Capped at 1 trade per day

This week was riddled with volatility and we still made it out with a good week and keeping pace on the challenge to $1m.

The one trade rule obviously doesn’t help when there were 3 or more A+ setups everyday but that’s what makes it harder 🤷‍♂️ 

Overall the methodology of our challenge has been working regardless of market conditions and I’m looking forward to getting back into a few weeks of calmer movement which helps our trades pan out even better.

For now we are riding the wave 🌊 

Cheers 🥂

Anytime that I buy OTM options they always seem to not work out but then there are always opportunites available that I seem to miss. For example, should I set limit orders and hope that one of these hit? It is just frustrating because I have missed out on 20x ROI twice in the past week. </td>

But anyway verbs strategy is at the finish point.
1st they built verb live, a private live streamer so they could get 100k some odd merchants to sell like her:
https://youtu.be/lpvFxCdvSjk

Then verb built the beta to test ui/ux  as the the final product was built alongside the beta, kept secret so it wouldnt be copied. U look at the terms &amp;amp; conditions &amp;amp; u see it is Verbs beta, 

https://www.shoppopup.tv

The final product demo here:
https://youtu.be/c5xKOK6VhZg

Then out of nowhere, url gets put up in the pic

Next couple weeks, promotional events, then launch. I know i know crazy talk. just watch it. Cant wait to shop on the next $AMZN +$NFLX  of shopping, entertaining shoppable content produced by Verb&amp;#39;s David Meltzer, yep the same who signed to produce $AAPL &amp;#39;s streaming content for its Tv

Taking a quote :

Buffett has also made the argument that Apple’s iPhone ecosystem is “sticky” and encourages customers to regularly upgrade, making it a safer investment and more like a consumer company than a tech company.

Glad that Tim Cook took his advice so seriously … 

Now the diversified portfolio of items have helped AAPL to beat sales record and EPS..

Excellent pattern development that I posted an hour ago before today&amp;#39;s EOD bullish breakout on SPY hehe! Another easy &amp;quot;VIX/SPY Pattern confirmation&amp;quot; that I have warned you about and develops exactly as expected giving us the easy BULLISH intraday signal as VIX breaks down while SPY breaks out of a symmetrical pattern hehe! 
 
You can&amp;#39;t say I didn&amp;#39;t warn you yesterday about the super green day we are having today just after AAPL had released its ER hehe! (link: https://stocktwits.com/FPL/message/431161378)  
 
You can also check all my posts since Monday which predicted this week&amp;#39;s bottom by only analyzing VIX, SPY and its option market while sharing with you such &amp;quot;before the fact&amp;quot; data AND analysis for free hehe! We are closing the week up +0.91% after the carnage we saw on Monday hehe! (Remember I told you not to panic as long as VIX wasn&amp;#39;t registering a &amp;#39;Higher High&amp;#39; on the Daily? Link: https://stocktwits.com/FPL/message/430687870 )

That being said, just because one of the best companies had a great quarter, doesn’t really mean much for the majority of the stocks that rallied today. Fed Rate hikes and international concern in Europe are still real negative catalysts for growth names.

But that&amp;#39;s cuz THEY have failed THEMSELVES at trying it 
 
TA is basic math.  Well, 5% of it.  The other 95%?  PSYCHOLOGY 
 
Today, for example, I made this call on the $SPY (see image).  But what you can&amp;#39;t see in the image is what I mentioned - ON VIDEO - in the premarket this morning (&amp;quot;a drop to about 428, then a run to the low 440&amp;#39;s). 
 
If TA doesn&amp;#39;t work, how am I able to do this - EVERYDAY? 
 
The answer is TA DOES work...period.  When someone tells you &amp;quot;TA doesn&amp;#39;t work,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s because THEY can&amp;#39;t get out of their feelings long enough to play the BASIC MATH necessary to bank a profit. 
 
If a casino can take your money with a pair of dice (or deck of cards), due to basic probabilities, then YOU can be &amp;quot;the casino&amp;quot; and trade stocks for a living 
 
If the image doesn&amp;#39;t do &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; for you, maybe the video will?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY7Lo-xrWyM&amp;amp;t=17s 
 
Have a great wknd ppl; STAY GREEN!

I still feel we are in a controlled dump and still worry Ukraine/Russia could become the black swan event that smashes the markets. I pray leaders find peace because I hate the entire concept of war. There are so many innocents dying, usually for a few ppls greed. However, idc how low markets or tesla price goes. I will not go long anything until I see us past this conflict. Gas prices soaring would only magnify inflationary situation we are already in. Supply chain issues would get worse as well. It&amp;#39;s too risky and probably why you see some dumping behavior in the markets right now. So tonight, I ask you all to pray for sensibility to come to these leaders, and peace is found. 🙏peace❤️love </td>

In life, always avoid Teslatard Bulltards and Potterheads. Casual fans are okay, but the hardcore ones are batshit crazy. Harry Potter fans are right up there. Watch out.  Most of the bulls here are insanely biased and offer terrible arguments. Normally, they they just invoke Elon&amp;#39;s wealth as a way to justify their purchase.  Many pumpers came up with insane price targets. Why? Because they feel entitled. Rotten. </td>

There are tonsssss of haters on $asti and tonsssss of people who will tell you a reverse split never works.
I’m here to tell you, I think this company just took a huge step towards making a fortune.  Sure, there will be some rough times ahead, but with their technology patents, getting up in the big board could bring in some monster investors!  They literally have the best thin film solar panels in the world, verified by nasa.  You don’t think some huge investors won’t want a piece of that??  I’m talking to you $TSLA 

All the trash talkers will soon be regretting selling or having to backtrack on some hate because they held because they were down and it ends up being a great move! </td>

Just keep accumulating.. ignore the noises … few yrs ago back when the stock was $141 pre-split 
($28) Ramping up Model X 2016 I saw Elon was stressing out before ER Feb ..asked few ppl if everything was ok as WS and short sellers were trolling abusively shorting and posting pics about failed falcon wings and how disastrous Model X was.. I just chose to accumulate and block all these haters.. followed my intuition and conviction in Tesla Elon .. I knew Elon was going to pull it off and get things done ✔️ unlike what WS clowns would lead you to believe .. I don’t know today these memories are back in my head very much alive with so much similarities - ELON IS GIVING EVERYONE HINTS FOR NEW UPCOMING MILESTONES that everyone is ignoring again especially WS … the gift that never stops giving .. Tesla Elon allowing you to scoop up these shares before they take off IMO!

Anytime that I buy OTM options they always seem to not work out but then there are always opportunites available that I seem to miss. For example, should I set limit orders and hope that one of these hit? It is just frustrating because I have missed out on 20x ROI twice in the past week. </td>

“He said plans for its Cybertruck, would be pushed back to at least 2023, along with a new Roadster and a semi truck. He said he hopes Tesla will be &amp;quot;ready to bring those to production hopefully next year. That is most likely.&amp;quot;

Don’t get me wrong, Elon if a fantastic person, there is no person on Earth like him!!!

How much money is enough for Elon? The answer, he will never ever have enough! 
And because of that, the people who ordered the Cybertruck, the Roadster, and Semi Truck will suffer for it. 

This year Elon is lined up to receive a bonus of about 32 Billion dollars from Tesla, for the year 2021.

Trust me, he will be getting another very large bonus for 2022, if his production plans hold up. 

I have a bad feeling the the above vehicles will be pushed back another year so he can get another bonus for 2023. 

You might see a small production of those vehicles in 2024. </td>

That be a huge win. 

And we will rebound next week. 

Lessons learned this week: 
-Don’t come on here hungover as it’ll make it 500 times worse 
-Elon should never ever not ever never ever be on another QE call 
-lose passwords to accounts during horrific downturns 
-I love Apple </td>

Very calm day for me trading wise. Just scalped $VXX  all day and a little of $UVXY  and $TSLA  for fun. Most of the profits did come from VXX once again. Not as many set ups today for VXX compared to these past few days because spy wasn’t as volatile today but still managed to get to 1k+ for the day. Glad I had 5/5 Green Day’s once again. Haven’t had this in a long time. Hope you all banked today. Have a good evening everyone 😀 </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> $F - it&amp;#39;s very difficult in this market environment to expect an accurrate multiple adjustment upward, which I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say $F deserves. Their rapidly growing electric vehicle business will be 30% the size of $TSLA by the end of this year.  That will change all my math, but let&amp;#39;s keep it simple for now with the current metrics. Currently that means the company sells 4x the vehicles of $TSLA at less than 10% of the valuation.   
 
Capt&amp;#39;n Obvious with end of week reminder... still from wicked cold Boston.  Just remember the logic... &amp;quot;if this - then that&amp;quot; If  $TSLA is now worth $846 per share... then $F should now be worth at least $84 per share! </td>

So many probabilities.

As long as the hourly bull trailing stop is below price, it is on a bearish retrace relative to the 4 hour - unless it takes out the 4 hour bear trailing stop.

While on a bearish retrace, it is on a rally - which is shorter term bullish. ;)

But that&amp;#39;s cuz THEY have failed THEMSELVES at trying it 
 
TA is basic math.  Well, 5% of it.  The other 95%?  PSYCHOLOGY 
 
Today, for example, I made this call on the $SPY (see image).  But what you can&amp;#39;t see in the image is what I mentioned - ON VIDEO - in the premarket this morning (&amp;quot;a drop to about 428, then a run to the low 440&amp;#39;s). 
 
If TA doesn&amp;#39;t work, how am I able to do this - EVERYDAY? 
 
The answer is TA DOES work...period.  When someone tells you &amp;quot;TA doesn&amp;#39;t work,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s because THEY can&amp;#39;t get out of their feelings long enough to play the BASIC MATH necessary to bank a profit. 
 
If a casino can take your money with a pair of dice (or deck of cards), due to basic probabilities, then YOU can be &amp;quot;the casino&amp;quot; and trade stocks for a living 
 
If the image doesn&amp;#39;t do &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; for you, maybe the video will?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY7Lo-xrWyM&amp;amp;t=17s
